`index.js` exists so one can locally run the experiment on a Node.js server. The jsPsych library must be unzipped first. Within `index.js`, you must also remove the consent and debrief pages from the timeline. For some reason, jsPsych isn't able to display the PDFs of those forms and will fail. Lastly, if you wish to save files locally, you must uncomment the `.php` save destination and instead use the `/save` route destination for Node.
