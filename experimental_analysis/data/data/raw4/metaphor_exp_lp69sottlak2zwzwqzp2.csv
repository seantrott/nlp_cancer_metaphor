I give the friend credit for trying to help, but I know someone that is having an even worse time with cancer right now.  What Jennifer is going through is horrible, but there are thousands of people in the world who are going through the same thing or worse and they are not looking for money to be donated.  I would give a little to Jennifer, but I don't feel that give more than a little is appropriate b/c what about all the people going through the same thing or worse that are not asking for money.  They are just as deserving as Jennifer.""}"
