As Jason battles this disease, he will have many treatments of chemotherapy and possibly radiation.  Jason knows he is in for a battle and he is ready to fight this throughout the coming months of treatment, medications and hospital care.  \n\nHe has started chemotherapy that has caused him to be fatigued and nauseated.  We are praying for his recovery.  \n\nAs a good friend of Jason's, I am trying to help raise money to help with the many expenses he will have in his fight for good health. Anything you can give will help so that he won't have to worry so much about the bills.  Thank you very much.""}"
