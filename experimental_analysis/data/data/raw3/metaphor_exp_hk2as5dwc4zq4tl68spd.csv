The cure for cancer will never be found when deadly treatments are more profitable.  The cure to cancer is to fast and activate autophagy to clean up the overgrowth of toxins in the body that were never given the chance to clear out due to constant insulin and consumption and eating that most consumers are taught in the western societies.  The study was interesting, thank you.""}"
