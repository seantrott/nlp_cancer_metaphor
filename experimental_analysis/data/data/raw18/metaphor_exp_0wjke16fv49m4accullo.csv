Along with advocacy and emotional support, we ensure that Wyoming families will not lose everything they own simply because they've had the misfortune of having a child with cancer. We provide non-medical financial assistance for any Wyoming family regardless of income, allowing them to focus on one of the most emotional and critical challenges in life, having a child with cancer.\n\nThere are no pediatric cancer centers in our state. A Wyoming family whose child is diagnosed with a brain or spinal cord tumor or cancer suddenly faces unexpected medical expenses as well as numerous road trips for medical appointments and treatments, resulting in financial hardships which may include loss of income.""}"
