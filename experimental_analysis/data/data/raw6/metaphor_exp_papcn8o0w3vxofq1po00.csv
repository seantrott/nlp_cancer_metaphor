A major hospital in Florida would not even keep him on as a patient unless we paid everything up-front each time he received chemo and radiation (after surgery)  After we paid them, then we could submit to our insurance and see what they would pay. So we moved him to a smaller hospital, also very good doctors, and there he had the complicated surgery and follow-up treatments. All of this lasted 2 years until his death in 2008.  So I know the expenses are huge and the need is great among all people. Our insurance was helpful, but we struggled, none the less.""}"
