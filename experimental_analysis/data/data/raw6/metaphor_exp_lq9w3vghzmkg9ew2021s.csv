Even those with excellent health insurance have incredible expenses during such treatment. My dad couldn't work when they treated his cancer but the mortgage and light bills still showed up. Then there are other things, like bus fare to the hospital and all of that! You can see why I would want to help out this obviously friendly young woman.""}"
