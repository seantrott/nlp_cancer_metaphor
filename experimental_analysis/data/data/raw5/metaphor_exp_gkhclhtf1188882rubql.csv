While not a typical scholar myself, I am extremely fascinated by IT and would love to see at the very least your opinions on your findings at the end. In the off chance this study is of a psychological nature, I would also be very interested in more information on how it goes as well. When all is said and done, if you have the means to point me in the right direction in order to find what public knowledge is available to learn the outcome, I would be grateful. Thank you for all you do, whatever it may be. ""}"
