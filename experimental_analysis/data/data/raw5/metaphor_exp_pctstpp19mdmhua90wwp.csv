This guy named Jason underwent surgery and came out of the surgery with a terrible condition called Lymphopenia II.  Every 21 days for the next 3-4 months he is going to need blood replacement.  The machines, and tools to monitor, and do this cost a lot of money. I am thinking of donating $30.00 to help with the cost for all this for his family.  Maybe you could match me $30.00 and we can donate a total of $60.00 to Jason?""}"
