The overreaction to covid and the financial ruin millions are suffering just makes me feel kind of \""oh freaking well\"" about cancer/aids/heart disease/als/alzheimers/etc/etc/etc. Look everyone has to die from something. I had cervical cancer, my best friend had kidney cancer, I went through a divorce, my parents dies in a car accident, my best friend's husband died, then her son killed himself, on and on and on the horror goes. We both are finally financially stable, and now a completely man-made horror is screwing us up. I've paid my dues and paid for my house and my car and paid for the kids to go to college. I earned what I have, and now, just to keep meat on the table, I have to drive to two different stores and send my current husband and son through different lines so we can get around the rationing rules. All this over a disease that kills less than 5% of those who get it. How freaking stupid is this? People are losing businesses, our tenants cannot pay their rents, and all for what???""}"
