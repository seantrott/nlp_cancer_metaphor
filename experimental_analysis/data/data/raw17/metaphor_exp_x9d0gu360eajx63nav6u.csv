It doesn't target, it does not care who or when. It's hard for me to even think about this because of how close to home Jason's situation truly hits. I've watched too may people fade away from cancer already. I hope not to watch another for as long as I live. Jason needs as much help as anyone can truly give. I mean, after getting out of surgery for his thyroid, then to only be diagnosed with Lymphoma. Lymphoma can be one of the worst cancers to deal with, and dealing with it can be troublesome at best. After all it resides at first in the Lymphatic system, and any cancer can metastasize(move to other portions of the body i.e. Liver cancer found in the brain.) The lymphatic system itself would make that even easier as the cancer can travel to other lymph nodes with relative ease and then would be exposed to a larger chance to metastasize into other body parts quickly and rarely but possible wide spread. And honestly the most disheartening thing about it all is basically the best treatment is just to bring the person as close to death's door as possible and then bring them back. Hoping the cancer is weaker than the person and dies due to such a treatment. It sounds barbaric like that but how do you kill something inside your body made from your body that just won't die or stop reproducing? Albeit, yes there are strategies to weaken the cancers before pushing your body to the brink, we are still very much in the \""dark ages\"" of science when it comes to cancers. I truly hope Jason wins his war and he has my full support.""}"

So maybe it was testing for an emotional response, or just reading comprehension, or even just a basic knowledge test around the subject. As, you did ask me to explain it in my own words to someone else any of those would be my best guess.""}"
