His family and friends anticipate that there will be a number of expenses associated with his recovery, and want to ease the financial burden by raising money for him. Jason is strong and committed to getting through this disease, but has real physical complications (nausea, fatigue, pain) following treatments. Every little bit raised helps him stay focused on recovery.""}"
