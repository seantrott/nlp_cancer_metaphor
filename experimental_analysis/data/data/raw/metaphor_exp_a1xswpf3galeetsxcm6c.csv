I just wanted to comment that the reason I chose not to donate to Jennifer's campaign was due to the fact that I am paying off hospital bills of my own (non-cancer related) and since my income is already low (combined with being furloughed from work) I would really like that bonus. Jennifer's bills are going to be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Ten or fifty bucks would mean a lot less for her situation than it would for mine. In my situation it would really help me but for her bills it's just a drop in the bucket.""}"
