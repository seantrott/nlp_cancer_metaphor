I think it is silly for me (who barely gets by) to give money so they can pay people half a million or more a year. Ridiculous. I HAVE given to individuals in fundraisers (for medical bills or unexpected vet bills) and I don't have a problem with that. I have also given $1 or $2 to homeless people. But to give to a charity? No, thanks.\n\n""}"
