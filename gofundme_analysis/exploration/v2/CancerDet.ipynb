Thankfully her doctors caught it early, but cancer is cancer no matter what stage it is. My mother is a strong woman and she will fight this like a champ. We will be by her side to fight along with her. The next step is to have an emergency hysterectomy which will remove her reproductive organs. She will need to have her uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes surgically removed. Before we can get her surgery scheduled, she will need to get a series of tests such as MRI, X-ray, and other exams to make sure she’s cleared for surgery and to see if the cancer has spread to other areas near her cervix. After surgery, she’ll have frequent follow ups. It’s a lot to take in at the moment, but with your help and prayers we know she will be okay. All funds raised will be directly put towards her medical expenses. Thank you \n",
