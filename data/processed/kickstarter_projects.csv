and In Health. I believe my husband Luke and I went through this
hard, cancer journey for a reason. At age 26 Luke was diagnosed with
a very rare bone cancer. He went through months of chemo treatment
and eventually had his leg amputated. In the year following I began
to write our story. I would write a chapter, call my mom and cry as I
would read it to her. In the beginning stages it was like therapy to
me. As I continued to write and let close friends and family read it
I soon realized that others were being inspired and helped through my
writing. The project grew and soon my chapters formed a book. Over
the past few years I have self published and had the story available
on facebook. I have loved the feedback I have received even from
people I don't know about how the story has helped them. One reader
wrote this to me 
 
"" Your writing is excellent. It has moved me very deeply. I just lost my wife to breast cancer six months ago, and reading what you wrote, I felt like I could directly relate to your feelings and experiences just as I went through something similar to you and felt and thought some of those same things as you did as I went through dealing with my wife's cancer and chemotherapy treatments. I hope that maybe someday, although I am not as good of a writer as you are that maybe someday I will be able to find the strength to share my story as well. Reading your story has been both extremely wonderful and extremely painful at the same time, but I felt like I needed to read what you had written to help me deal with the loss of my wife and how amazing she was in dealing with her chemotherapy and fighting cancer and always staying so strong and positive through it all."" After reading this comment and many others it encouraged me
to get my book published by a real publisher who can help me get this book into
thousands of peoples hands. By donating to this project you are helping more
than just my family. As you can see from the above comment, you are helping
many, many people. I wanted to give you the chance to read a sample chapter from my book-  Chapter 7Back to Hotel SunnysideThe days continued to pass and we still had not made a decision about Luke’s leg. We had to continue on with Luke’s chemo treatment. I was not looking forward to going back to “Hotel Sunnyside”. It hadn’t been that bad the last time, but it had a very distinct smell that always made me feel nauseous.I had already made sub plans and was off of work in order to stay with Luke at the hospital. The day of the treatment arrived and we headed to see Luke’s oncologist. This time Luke had to see the oncologist first and then the oncologist would put in the order for his chemo at the hospital.As we entered the sterile medical office I felt sick to my stomach. I never looked forward to seeing other cancer patients in the waiting room. All the bare heads were a reminder of the sickness overtaking so many people’s bodies. We were called back to the oncology room and waited for Luke’s oncologist. I looked around the small room and felt like I was suffocating. With every crinkle of the paper where Luke was sitting I felt as though I would faint.The door slowly creaked open. A tall, lanky doctor with thick glassed walked into the room.“Hi Luke” the doctor said with no emotion visible on his face.‘Hi” Luke replied with an equal lack of emotion in his voice.“Well, how are you feeling today?” the doctor said.“Okay” Luke replied. As they were talking I wondered how many people this doctor had seen die. I thought he had a depressing job, one that I could never do. He seemed so insensitive to Luke, and made me feel as though I was invisible. I was just another crying wife, which he had seen hundreds of time. He seemed to be so desensitized to the person that cancer was affecting. I wondered if anyone he loved had ever had cancer.I listened once again to their conversation.“Well Luke, you can go to Sunnyside tomorrow morning, but there is no guarantee you will get a bed, or you can go and try to get one tonight and go ahead and get the chemo started.” The doctor said.Luke looked at me.“Let’s get it over with and start tonight” Luke said.“That’s a good idea” I said.I was glad that we had already packed and had everything we needed in the car. We left the medical office and proceeded to drive to the hospital. We were soon parked and entering “Hotel Sunnyside”. I found it equally difficult to carry all of my stuff into the hospital as the time before. We walked to the front entrance of the hospital and were greeted by automatic doors escorting us into the place that we would be staying for the next five days. I crossed the threshold from my world into the hospital and felt instantly nauseous. Our feet made a loud clomp with every step we took and echoed throughout the halls. We made our way to the admittance room.There was a woman busily looking over papers at a small, desk covered with books and pencils. She looked up from what she was doing.“May I help you?” She said while setting down her pen.“Yes, I am here for my chemo treatment” Luke said.“Okay, what is your name?” She said.“Luke Bader” Luke replied.The woman began quickly typing on her computer. “You are in room 103” she said.“Here is the phone number” she said as she handed it to me. She didn’t realize I was staying with him. I guess it was kind of rare for a wife to stay with her husband for five days in the hospital, especially a pregnant wife!We left the office with all of our bags and headed down the long hallway to the oncology wing of the hospital. As we came closer to room 103 we were greeted by several nurses who remembered Luke. We passed the private room we had stayed in the first time and continued on. I wondered what kind of room we would be living in this time.We walked almost completely to the end of the hall and found a door with the numbers 103 next to it. I looked and saw that there was an elderly couple in the room. A thin, frail woman was lying on the bed with an older man beside her. I thought there was a mistake in the room we were given but I looked further in the room and saw that past a dividing curtain, by the window was a small bed.We entered the room.“Hi” I said quietly as we passed the elderly couple.I heard a faint “hi” in reply.We made our way over to the bed. The room felt very hot and stuffy. I looked around and realized that there was not even a bed or any possible space for me to stay. I felt very disappointed and tried to hold back my tears. Luke sat down on the bed and I began to put away our things in the small closet that was provided. I looked at Luke’s face and knew that he too was disappointed about the room that had been given to us. I knew he was hoping for a private room again.“Do you think there are any other rooms available?” I said in a whisper, as not to disturb our roommates on the other side of the thin curtain barrier. “I don’t know, but I hope so. This is too small and there is no room for you to sleep.” Luke said.“I know, when the nurse comes in, lets ask.” I said as I found a small chair to sit down in.A few minutes passed and a nurse walked in.“Hi, I am here to get your IV going” she said matter of factly . I was unfamiliar with the nurse. She did not seem very friendly.“We were wondering if there are any other rooms available. I am planning on staying all four nights with him and it doesn’t look like there is room for me to stay here.” I said.The nurse looked at my kind of funny, as if I was crazy for wanting to stay with my husband in the hospital.“We are really busy right now, but I can check if there is anything available. I will be back in just a minute” she said as she quickly walked out of the room.I could hear muffled voices coming from the other side of the room and I wondered what they were talking about. I wondered what kind of cancer the woman next to Luke had. Was it terminal? Did the chemo help her? Did her husband stay with her? I often wondered what other people’s cancer stories were.I heard footsteps entering the room. I looked up and saw my parents walking in. “Hi” my mom said.“Hi” I replied.“Can you believe how tiny this room is? We just asked if we could get a different one and a nurse is going to come back and tell us if we can in a few minutes.” I said.My parents looked around our half of the tiny room.“Ya, it’s pretty tight in here” my dad said. “Here you can have this chair” I said to my mom as I got up and sat down on the bed with Luke. My mom sat down and my dad remained standing. The four of us barely fit in the room. I noticed that Luke was dripping sweat from his face. Luke was easily hot and sweaty. The stuffy room was making “Hotel Sunnyside” almost unbearable for Luke.I said a silent prayer for Luke;“Dear God, please help us to get in another room. It would be so much easier for Luke if we had more space and a cooler room. I pray that by some miracle there will be an open bed somewhere. Thanks. Amen”The nurse entered the room.“I found a bed for you, it isn’t a private room, but it is bigger and will have room for your wife to sleep.” The nurse said.I whispered a prayer of thanks.I began gathering up our items out of the closet. I put as many bags as I could hold on my shoulders and tried to balance them. My protruding stomach made it difficult to balance, but I did the best that I could.I was happy that my parents were there to help us move our things. After all of our things were gathered we followed the nurse back down to the other end of the hall. She showed us the room we would now be staying. As I walked through the doorway I could tell that this room was about three times larger than the previous room.We were going to be staying on the right side of the room. I looked to the left side of the room and was saddened by what I saw. Lying on the small hospital bed there was a man who appeared to be sleeping. I looked closer and saw that he was very thin. I could tell that in his pre-cancer days he was a man of average build and size. His brown skin now looked as though it were barely hanging on to his bones.  His side of the room was decorated with flowers, cards and balloons. There was a large card that I could tell was made by kids. It said “We miss you” and was signed by many kids. I wondered what kind of work he did with kids.My heart fell into a deeper sadness as I saw that he did not have anyone sitting by his side. I wondered where his family was. Did he have a wife? Kids? Where were they? I could not imagine not being by my husband’s side through every day of treatment that he had to endure.Luke went to his new bed and I knew he was anxious to get his treatment started so that he could get it over with. I once again began unpacking our things. I found that there was a chair which turned into a bed for me. I was pleased to see that it was a larger bed than the last time we stayed at the hospital.“Okay Luke, let’s get your IV started” the nurse said as soon as Luke was in his new bed. Throughout the evening Luke’s visitors continued to come in.  Every once in awhile we would hear a moan from the other side of the room. And I couldn’t help wondering what was happening with man we were sharing a room with.When it was time for bed I began my pre-bed routines. I folded out the little bed I would be sleeping on. I put down a foam pad as well as a body pillow. I kissed Luke goodnight and tried to make myself comfortable. The swish-pump, swish-pump sounds of Luke’s IV continued to go. As I laid down I found it hard to sleep as there was light peaking it way through the blinds. I got up and readjusted them. They still didn’t keep the light out, but I knew there was nothing I could do about it.I finally relaxed and tried to forget where I was at. I closed my eyes and began to drift off to sleep.“Ahhhhhhh”  A loud voice yelled.I was quickly awakened and reminded of where I was. The lights were instantly turned on and I could hear the voices of the nurses. I realized that something was very wrong with the man behind the curtain. Luke and I looked at each other. I said a silent prayer for the man. A few minutes later the lights were turned off and I tried to sleep again. The moaning came again and it grew louder. Again the lights were turned on and there were more words from the nurses that I couldn’t make out. This continued throughout the whole night. Luke and I didn’t get very much sleep that night. I was very disturbing physically and emotionally. Hearing this man’s cries made cancer even more of a reality to me. He was in so much pain and there was nothing that anyone could do about it. My hate for cancer grew that night. I began to visualize that cancer was an evil beast and I wanted to strangle it to death and it then it could never come back to destroy anyone’s life again. I felt tired, I felt angry and most of all I felt scared. Scared for the future of my husband’s life. I prayed and prayed that the evil cancer beast would never destroy the body of my one true love, my sweet husband.I drifted in and out of sleep and tried to take my mind to another place. I needed a memory of a happier time to help me escape the reality of my present situation. As I closed my eyes fuzzy images began to come into focus and I could hear the sound of laughter. “Look, he’s going to do it!” I yelled enthusiastically as I peered out the window of my parent’s house.I was instantly joined by my mom and my two sister-in-laws, Jessica and Amy. The four of us peeked through the window and watched as my dad and Luke walked outside, where my dad was going to feed the cows. The beautiful landscape of the countryside was a perfect place for Luke to ask my dad for my hand in marriage.I quickly grabbed my video camera in an effort to preserve the moment that I wanted to one day show my children. “Oh that is so cute” Jessica said.“How do you know he is asking him right now?” Amy asked.“Well, I know he is going to ask me soon, and why else would he ask to go take a walk with dad? You know he isn’t much of a talker!” I replied.“Neither is your dad” my mom said as she smiled brightly with a hint of tears brimming in her eyes.I continued looking outside and saw the two most important men in the world to me. That moment was the first time I realized how alike they were. My dad had always been the strong, silent type who didn’t always let me know what he was thinking. He was always a very good provider and made sure we knew that we were loved. He reminded me of a rock. When he talked we listened and obeyed. Dad’s word was final. There was nothing in the world that could make him falter from his convictions and faith in God.  Inside that rock, there was also a soft layer of emotions that could be seen from time to time. I have always enjoyed those glimpses into the softer layer.Luke also possessed the characteristics that my dad did. He was strong like a rock. His soft layer was not a mystery to me, not to everyone else. As I looked at him I realized that he would probably keep his soft layer hidden from our children. I thought about what Luke had told me one time. He had said that while he was like a rock, I was like a stock market, you never knew if I was going to be up or down! I put down the video camera and continued with the Thanksgiving preparations. I was trying to become “wifely” since I knew marriage was in the near future, so I had baked several apple pies. Luke was so proud of me, but complained that I made a mess.I watched the rock of my past and the rock of my future walk towards the house and I thanked God that I was so extremely blessed.The bright lights jolted me from my memories and brought me back to the pain of the present. I felt hot tears beginning to moisten my eyes as I fought with all my strength to hold them back. It was my turn to be the rock, my turn to be strong.Suddenly I felt as though God was whispering in my ear, whispering words of a that I had not thought of in a long time. I heard these words and knew they were a special gift for me.“Michelle, I am the rock, your fortress, and your deliverer; I am your rock in whom you take refuge. I am your shield and the horn of your salvation, your stronghold. Psalm 18:2“Oh God” I prayed silently“Thank you for being the rock, I cannot do it alone! I am scared” I paused to look at my husband who was resting his eyes and probably doing the same thing as me.I could now taste salt from my tears as I struggled to keep my crying muffles as I did not want to bother Luke.“Jesus” I continued“This is bigger than anything I have ever been through. Please show me what to do to be an encouragement and help to my husband. Help me to continue to let go of the anger. I can feel it trying to take its place in my life and I don’t want it! God please once again give me your indescribable peace and also give it to Luke. I thank you for him, I thank you for his positive attitude. Thank you that through him, others can see You. Oh Lord, we are still facing such a big decision with Luke’s leg. Please give us direction about whether to do the amputation or not. Thank you for promising that you will not give us more than we can handle. Thank you for being my peace and my rock.”I kept my eyes closed and the lights soon turned off. A peace soon fell over me and I fell fast asleep.When I woke up in the morning I felt peace but I still felt torn about the decision that continued to linger over us everyday. It was not an easy decision and I didn’t know how we were ever going to decide. “One day at a time” I said to myself as I prepared to speak to Luke about the decision.

""You should write a book.""  I've heard it, literally, thousands of times over my blessed/challenged-beyond-believability/Fantasy Land-like lifetime. So...I've done it.  Written a book.  Or AM doing it at least.  For the past 3 years, I've been writing, writing, writing.  And...I'm almost there.  (The ""Introduction"" below explains a whole lot more). I've explained a bit about my book, ""Been There, Done That,"" in this Kickstarter proposal.  There is quite a bit more on my site, at www.rickbassman.com  In short  it's about MY life -- which in writing Been There, Done That, I've realized that is more like 8 Lives. (8 down, one to go?) In 2012, I acquired one of the literary field's top agents.  He/they not long thereafter, got me a ""deal"" with one of the top publishing houses in the industry.  From there, things went to hell pretty damned quickly. Like most of us, I'm pretty attached to my story.  I wanted it handled in a specific way, and marketed in a specifically proactive manner.  While I like to think I was flexible in how this would all go down, at the end of the day --and despite an offer of a pretty decent advance -- I could see that me and my agent/publisher/editor/editor's publicity department-- weren't going to see eye-to-eye.  This brought to the forefront of my mind what to me was a very important question...  Do I take the money and run? Or, do I exercise my personal vision? I've experienced MANY failures in my business life (not-to-mention the PERSONAL  stuff, but let's save that for the Book).  In-between the abundance of spectacular crashes-and-burns, I've done okay....I've been an agent at William Morris, an Emmy-Award Winner, a creator of the then-hottest promotional entity in the NFL, high-ranking Disney exec, owner/operator of a pro wrestling company that I sold to WWE (formerly WWF), pioneer of Mixed Martial Arts in North America, and so on and so forth.  In doing all of this, I've always said ""if you must choose commercialism over artistic integrity, choose the former.""  Well, guess what?  In writing my Book, for the first time ever, I found myself leaning toward the latter. I went out to my many friends, in personal conversation and through social media, explained my situation (the publisher/editor/agent gone awry), and asked ""What would you do?""  Overwhelmingly  -- and especially from those who know some of my story-- the answer was...""SELF PUBLISH!"" But here's the challenge (my word for problem)....MONEY!  As I mentioned, ""Been There, Done That"" is structured primarly aroud 8 Chapters, or ""Lives"" (again, explained in more detail below).  Nonetheless, and by way of explanation (about MONEY that is), Chapter 7, or my ""7th Life"" is entitled: ""The Downfall:  Or, Everything That Can Go Wrong, WILL Go Wrong.""  It chronicles one of the afformentioned crasesh-and-burn,s this one of epic proportions.  These days, I'm in ""recovery,"" in every way imaginable, but I'm still-not-quite-there just yet. (Chapter 8 is ""The Comeback: Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying"").  Thus...I NEED YOUR HELP. My goal, as stated in my Kickstarter Campaign herein, is to raise $50,000. In total, this will result in a first-class hardcover book, with LOTS of photos, a similar soft cover version, and an accompanying marketing effort pointed toward seeing ""Been There, Done That"" hit #1 on the New York Times Non-Fiction charts.  Now, by saying this, I realize I run the risk of: 1.  Disbelief.  First, if/when I realize my funding goal, the hardcover WILL be produced, 100%, by June.  It's simply a matter of doing.  To me, THAT part has always been easy.  I am commited to this.  I am passionate about this.  I will get this done.  Now, past having a book in hand, there is much to do.  While I cannot control"" whether or not Been There, Done That climbs to #1, I sure-as-hell KNOW that WE (me, my social media team, my publicist and YOU) together can...attract 100,000 active connections that support the effort; generate tons of press; book meaningful media appearances; etc.  The ingredients are all there... 2.  Resentment.  In stating I want/intend to see Been There, Done That at #1, it may sound a little (or a lot) self-aggrandizing/self-important.  But...more than anything, my story is one of redemption and renewal.  Of getting my ass kicked in just about every way imaginable, and rising from the ashes.  To rise ALL THE WAY,  I have to believe.  And at the end of the day, doesn't everyone love an underdog? I hope that YOU do.  And provided you do, please know that my focus on the #1 spot is exercised with the humblest of attitudes. If you've read this far, perhaps you're willing to come a little bit further (anyone out there starting to recognize ""The Shawshank Redemption"" references?)... Here is how the funding will be utilized: Developmental
  Editing - $ 5000;    Copy
  Editing $ 10,000 (hey, it's a BIG book!);    Artwork - $1500 (a bargain, from the exceptionally talented Tanja Richter.  Check out her work at www.futurecircus.com);    Social Media - $5500.  This is being done presently and my wonderful team at Local Marketing 2.0 is doing an incredible job for me on a deferred basis, because they believe.  www.localm2.com    Public Relations - $7500.  Longtime industry leader Levine Communications Office is at my side.  Chairman Michael Levine, with 18 books on the market, knows a thing or two about publishing.  President Liam Collopy is handling my account personally, which should result in substantive media attention throughout the entire process.  Like Local M2, LCO too is busting their butts for me on a deferred basis.  www.lcoonline.com;   Fulfillment - $4000. This is what I expect to spend at UPS, the US Post Office and on airlines, to fulfill the Rewards for my awesome donors! Printing/Self Publishing House Premium Package -Now, THIS is the big one.  I intend on doing this right.  That means finished hardcover and paperback editions of the caliber of a major Simon-Shuster, Penguin, etc. release.  And, something a Simon-Shuster or Penguin likely would never let me do...LOTS of photos.  In the longrun, I think my photos, spanning 3 decades of pretty outrageous pesons, places and situations, will help make the market for my Book. For just a small sample, check out this page on my site, http://rickbassman.com/favorite-pics/, or my personal Facebook, which has TONS of photos.  http://www.facebook.com/#!/rickbassman.  I won't know the EXACT cost of printing until the text, photos and artwork are assembled, and what the total of my Package will be, but at this time, I can safely estimate well over $10,000. In a lifetime of dreaming dreams, of falling spectacularly --and sometimes miserably-- short, and at times, blessedly, in realizing some seemingly outrageous goals, seeing ""Been There, Done That"" come to fruition, and giving it a real shot at making #1, is far-and-away the dream of my life.  Please help me to make this dream...my dream...come true. Thank you, Rick ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As promised... BEEN THERE, DONE THAT Introduction I've written this book over the course of nearly three years, and
in no chronological order, whatsoever. Rarely, would I backtrack and read what I’d written previously. My writing has been accelerating, vastly, of late, and the
end is in sight. I’m so excited.I’m purposefully not going back, because I’m
feverishly looking forward, to that day –or
late night—when I take stock of all I’ve written and attempt to assemble into a
BOOK. I mention not going
back for a reason. BECAUSE, on the
occasions when I have gone back --to
complete something I’d started days, or even months before—I’d start to notice
some inconsistencies. Not where FACTS
are concerned, but more so in how I was looking at, or felt about, something
that had happened in my life. I attribute
this to a natural course of “progression,” or result, of major occurrences in
my life, as I wrote. Or, something as
simple as a mood swing. For a moment, I
contemplated going back, to make everything “consistent,” but only for a
moment. Hey, maybe I’m lazy.But my rationale is three-fold.One: Been There, Done That, is as much stream of consciousness/state of mind,
as it is about my story, of what happened on the physical plane. And I felt
that by going back, I’d bastardize
that. Two:My “readers,” Sylvia, Brett, Eric, Gina, Katherine, Tom, Stacey, Cindy, Joey and Susan, professed to be
tremendously entertained, and since all of them are incredibly bright,
well-read, introspective and experienced-in-life, I figured I was onto
something, Their suggestions, but
mostly, their encouragement, kept me at the keyboard; and Three: I figured if James Frey could get away with it in “A Million Little
Pieces,” and sell 5 million copies(!)
–with a “Memoir” that is largely considered everything from anti-structure to
brilliant to utterly non-sensical—if he could
get away with it, well then, I could too. I feel it’s important to mention Mr. Frey and his book.If I have even a modicum of success with Been
There, Done That, I suppose that the comparisons to ""A Million Little Pieces"" are
inevitable. Thus, there’s something I
need to get out of the way here and now…EVERYTHING in MY book is TRUE. There is a small possibility that some minor details are out of order, in
terms of chronology, but I did my level best to check with people that were there and doing that with me, to
reduce this possibility. Further, and
more importantly, NOTHING is FABRICATED, nor even slightly embellished, throughout. As I like to say --for the most part-- I hav ethe pictures to prove it. Going back, to back-tracking…Really, the only time I’d go
back is when I had started a section and left it incomplete, and would go back
to add to it. Probably just as I’ll do with this Introduction, which I’m
starting on October 24, 2011 (so again, please, if you will, forgive me my mood
swings). Been There, Done That was written in numerous locales. Basically, I’d carry my old-school RCA
microcassette recorder everywhere, and when the mood really struck, fire up my
laptop in the most unlikely of places. The words themselves have been written in their entirety in Word files,
on my slightly-used, increasingly beaten up, Dell Inspiron E1505. At a “massage parlor” in Bucharest, Romania,
at the African Advocates for AIDS 10th Anniversary Conference in
Raleigh, North Carolina, at the Insane Clown Posse’s “Annual Gathering of the
Juggalos” in Bumfu*k, Illinois, in ocean view diners, bars, cafes and ratty
motels up and down the California and Oregon Coasts, and in just as many bars
and cafes in Studio City and Hollywood, CA, near my then-home in Valley Village, and just as much in my current home...a small cabin, surrounded by woods, in Big Bear, California. (Thank you Michael Dell and Company for
building such a durable machine, and thank you Samantha for allowing me to pick
it up from your office after my last laptop crashed). Oftentimes, I think I'm just all-over-the-place. but just as quickly, I dispel any
notion of thinking I want to settle in,
simply by observing the varied locations in which I wrote. To live, I need to stay on the move.Mostly,
my book was written at my previous home, behind chain-link and razor-wire in,
the cavernous Porn Studio in North Hollywood, and in the small “guest cottage”
in the backyard of the bucolic home, on a tree-lined suburban street in ValleyVillage.The ONLY constant
throughout, has been Ramone, alternately fixing me with that withering Daddy-I’m-bored-out-my-mind-can’t-we-do-SOMETHING!?!
stare, or snoring contentedly at my
side. Being the ever-organized guy I am, at least in some aspects of my life, I created
folders –“categories,” if you will—as my writing progressed. … ""Diary;""""Tall Tales;"" ""Philosophy;"" and ""It's Just Part
of Life."" The basic idea is this: ·The DIARY entries, which were written
during the time frame in which I've written this book, do appear
chronologically.  A current Diary entry brings to mind something that
happened at a point in my past,  …thus segueing to a  ·TALL TALE, which is basically a short
story, but so outrageous that is the “average” person were to live ONE of
these, he’d tell it over and over for his entire life. I’ve got several dozen. ·MY PHILOSOPHY (for what it’s worth), is
my take on what occurred at a certain point in time in my life, and how it
affected me and changed my outlook, no matter how small. Or sometimes,
meditations on themes that are universal…Love, Loss, Sex, Fear, Romance… ·IT’S JUST PART OF LIFE  is a
stand-alone segment, apropos of nothing, which I’ve done my best to place at a
spot in the book where it makes the most sense .  These entries are
generally pretty visceral/raw/on-the-edge, and cover things like my Scars, my
Tattoos, my Drug Use... It didn’t dawn on me until halfway through putting
four fingers to keyboard (both middle fingers and both index fingers; that’s how I learned to type), that I
would end up with eight “CHAPTERS,”
the first “The Cancer Years,” picking up when I was sixteen. (The complete
title of the Chapter is “My Mom Dies Suddenly and Tragically.Causing my Dad to go to work on the road to
pay the bills.Thereby leaving my
Brother and I to our own devices.Thus,
the Juvenille Delinquency years ensue.(Well –as much as Two Boys growing up as Upper-Middle Class Jews in the
Valley can be Delinquents anyways). (and oh yeah, I stress out to the max,
giving myself three years of ‘terminal’ cancer hell).” As these “Chapters” – which
also appear in chronological order” --evolved, I realized they would
provide some cohesiveness, some continuity to what I’d written. (in other words, I hope it all makes sense to
YOU) In total, as I write the first part of this Introduction, I am anticipating having nearly a hundred individual files
within the aforementioned sections, to string together. And I’m looking forward to it!It –writing this book—has been a hell of a
journey.It’s brought me to the depths
of despair, to the highest peaks of exhilaration; it’s caused me to ""anesthesize"" more than I have ever before in my life and it’s put me on back
on the path to physical and emotional health, I path which I hope, and intend,
to continue to walk with firm footing; it’s made me hate beyond a level to
which I would have believed I was capable, and love with a fuller heart, also
blessedly beyond which I previously believed I was capable.Writing this book has caused me to look
inside, deep inside, to recognize, and to admit to the foolhardinessof much (read: most) of my life, and it’s
given me just the very beginning…just an inkling…of a notion…that I am capable of the type of change that can (pray: will)
give me lasting happiness and peace, and the opportunity to spread a bit of
that to others. In writing this book, I’ve probably earned myself a beating
from a monstrous, very famous MMA Fighter, and a hissy fit from an even more
famous Pro Wrestler, several lawsuits, likely jail sentences (praying on that
statuate-of-limitations-thing) and a pair of cement shoes courtesy of a
prominent, reputed Las Vegas
crime family. Who knows how may lives
one lives, but you only die once. So,
who gives a damn? Right? Indeed, writing Been There, Done That has been a journey,
just as life has been, and God-willing, continues to be, day-after-blessed-day. I wish you a safe, (relatively) sane and exciting
journey. And the desire, the commitment,
the conviction, to LIVE, and to write

About the author: My name is Tammy. (That's me behind the 'Play Video' button in the picture above.) You'll learn a lot more about me through my project but there are two things you should know right away. First off, I'm a breast cancer survivor. This doesn't mean that I've ""beaten"" cancer. I was originally diagnosed in 2006 with Stage IIB invasive ductal carcinoma; however, a year after finishing standard treatment (chemo, radiation, and a lumpectomy) my cancer returned. Now I have Stage IV disease, which basically means that I can be treated for an indeterminate time but never cured.  Still, I'm surviving cancer every day, and somehow managing to defy the odds. Physically, my health has been stable since late 2008, when I first learned that the cancer metastasized to my spine. It would be wrong to claim that this disease hasn't affected my life in numerous (often devastating) ways, yet there are moments (dare I say days?) where I forget that I even have it. My cancer doesn't ""define"" me ... this, I can say for sure! The second thing you should know is that I'm a born traveler. My parents met on a cross country Greyhound bus trip, so wanderlust runs in my blood.  Although I don't mind buses (or cars, or planes) my heart belongs to the railroad. I first traveled via train back in 1990 on a family trip to Disneyland. I was 11 years old, and from the moment I stepped into the train car it was love at first ride!   Now, over 20 years later, my passion for the railroad remains intact. I've been able to ride the rails dozens of times since becoming an adult. Many of these trips were long-distance (most of them taken after my first cancer diagnosis). I've gotten to know a good portion of the American landscape through the windows of a train. I love the comfort and excitement of being rocked to sleep under the dark of North Dakota, only to wake up a few hours later to the sight of Wisconsin farmland rolling past my window. Many things inspire me but nothing so much as this kind of adventure! By now, I'm very familiar with the Amtrak system and could name you all 33 routes off the top of my head. I haven't ridden them all (yet!) but there are several that I've ridden more than once. If you watch my video, you'll see that the first half, my tribute to train travel, features images from some of my favorite routes, captured during trips I've taken both solo and with my husband, Merwyn. About the project: The ""journey"" in the title of my project has multiple meanings. There's cancer's metaphorical journey that I found myself on almost five years ago at age 27. Unlike most journeys, I don't know the duration of this one or where it might lead. Meanwhile, for better or worse I'll remain perpetually on board. For my project, I will embark on a physical (and spiritual) journey, by way of the American railroad. I'll travel across the country for about one month, stopping periodically to visit significant friends, family members, and locations. Concurrently, I will reflect on my life's journey through a series of letters that I'll be writing along the way. These letters will eventually be compiled into a book. Several of the letters I write will touch upon my cancer experience; however, the end result will not be just another ""cancer"" memoir. Instead, I'll share my story by acknowledging the people and places that have truly helped define me, unlike my illness. Who I am today can be traced in part to the influence and support of others – some close, some personal, some indirect, some surprising. These are the people I will address my letters to. Together the letters will fit like a puzzle to show how life's journey has led to today. From there I can plan what tomorrow might be. Why travel in order to write? Riding the rails is a fitting environment for this project, which revolves around so many journeys.  Traveling lends an authenticity to the letters I will write. I'll get to provide unique perspective as a 32-year-old female railroad enthusiast (really, how many of us are out there?) by including detailed descriptions of my surroundings within specific letters, as well as in a handful of separate passages/essays that will also be included in the book. Many of the people who have impacted my life so significantly are thousands of miles away. A trip will allow me to re-connect with these people face-to-face, which in turn should provide refreshed inspiration and perhaps even lead to new discoveries.  Finally, the train allows plenty of opportunity to meet new people, which is a journey in and of itself! Can't you just fly? Wouldn't that be easier/more convenient? Not really. As much as I love riding the train for adventure, it's also much easier on my health. I have some physical limitations from cancer that can make flying difficult. For example, due to the lesion on my spine and treatment-related anemia, it's often hard for me to stand for extended periods of time, such as while going through slow security lines.  Once inside a plane, I have to worry about how the cramped space might affect my compromised immune system, or how the small amount of leg room might aggravate the arthritis in my knees (a lasting side effect from chemo). Then there's the lymphedema in my right arm. I do have a sleeve to control this, but if the sleeve was ever forgotten or went missing for some reason, a flight practically guarantees a lymphedema flare-up. Trains provide much more open space and room to move around, therefore greatly decreasing most of my health concerns. Flying might (arguably) be more ""convenient"" in terms of getting me from one place to another in a short span of time. But it still requires time spent and arrangements made for traveling to and from each airport along with time wasted and raised stress levels going through security. Flying would also be cost prohibitive when considering the amount of ground I'll cover. Which route(s) will you be taking? Some of the destinations on my cross country itinerary include:  There will be plenty of other stops. Most of them are accessible via Amtrak. You can see some of the specific train routes I'll be riding (i.e. Coast Starlight, the Empire Builder, Silver Star) in my video. In the rare case I can't reach a particular destination directly on the train, I'll ride to the nearest location and then either ride with a friend or use public transportation to make it the rest of the way. What is the money needed for? The majority of the funds will cover train tickets. On overnight trips, I'll need to get a roomette due to my health requirements, the fiscal advantage being that my meals on the train will already be covered.  Most of my stops will be in cities where I’ll be able to save money (and enhance the pleasure of the trip) by staying with a friend or with family. For the few times I’ll need to get a hotel room I’ll be perfectly content with something like a Motel 6. The remainder of the funds will be used as seed money for self-publishing the book when it’s ready.  Kickstarter funds will not be used for souvenirs or nights on the town. Why are you writing this book? In addition to reasons cited above -- simply put, it's been ingrained in me almost my whole life that someday I would write a book. I started writing stories when I was about 6. I was pretty prolific for the next several years. I had a blast writing my stories about orphanages, bubblegum teen pop groups, talking dogs, human cartwheels, and who knows what else. Encouraged by teachers, and even more so by my dad and younger sister (my two most loyal readers), I felt confident that I'd be published, at the latest, by the time I turned 13.  Well, that didn't happen. Fiction writing stopped coming so easily to me somewhere in my early college years. But I continued to write sporadically and held on to the belief that I would someday write (and publish) something.  After my first cancer diagnosis, I finally started to write (or rather, ""blog"") again on a regular basis. My firsthand accounts of my cancer experience attracted a small audience of readers. Some of them encouraged me to write a book. I liked the idea, but the timing never felt right. Then I was diagnosed with mets and started to think about the proverbial bucket list. Writing a book was still high up there on my list -- in fact, it was right behind my dream of taking a train trip all around the country. I accomplished the latter for the first time in fall of 2009, and ... well, look at me now. I'm a veteran rail rider! Despite much continued encouragement from several individuals, it took over two years for me to finally feel ready to attempt to write a book. But the time has come.  I am ready to tell my story!  I have a good feeling about this project and a strong desire to see it fulfilled. I've already made a lot of progress. What used to be ""something I'll someday do"" is now being actively planned and turning into a very real possibility.  Now I'm asking for your help in taking the next step, and making my project a reality! Thank you so much for considering! If you have any more questions, feel free to let me know. I'll be happy to answer them, and/or add them to my FAQ list. :-) Stay tuned for news, photos, and other updates as this project unfolds!",57.33870967741935,1721,104,1.185,46.0,6,6,2011,1,1,17,breast cancer,1,3,1,1,0.0005810575246949448,0.0017431725740848344,0.0387696251201538,5.427413905127266,7.0,kickstarter

To be honest, I just chronicled the true story of my wife, Susan, and how we battled her cancer and how her diagnosis completely altered our lives.  Susan’s story is special because Susan is special; in fact, she has been called a “miracle girl” by her oncologist. So, what makes her so special?  In 2012 Susan was diagnosed with breast cancer. We soon learned that she had two separate cancers. During the next several weeks we were told her cancers had metastasized to her lymph system and into her lungs, and, worse, it had spread to multiple locations in her bones. Bad news, right?  You bet it was. Her medical team told us they couldn’t cure her and that she had only a couple of years to live.  When we were told she was going to die I had a strong desire to do anything that might help her. So, I started to research things we could do that might buy her extra time. I found out that making changes to our lifestyle could help.  For example, I came up with a diet where every ingredient fights cancer and I eliminated foods that fuel tumor growth or cause cellular inflammation, which meant no processed foods, sugars, meat, or dairy. Plus we added a strict exercise routine and changed our mental approach to how we lived our lives, just to name a few things.  I wrote about those changes on our blog, which has now become a book. Okay, so what makes Susan special?  Susan implemented every change no matter how hard it was, and she stuck to them. She never cheated nor wavered . . . ever.  As a result, she started winning her war with cancer and, in the end, she managed to do something her doctors said was impossible. She went into total remission.  In A Recipe for Hope, Susan’s story is told in real time and not in retrospect. Her story has a big-time villain that is constantly trying to kill her. It has emotional highs and lows, humor, and heroes. But most importantly, it has a great section on foods that fight cancer and other life-threatening diseases and which are backed by credible science.  I’ve also included over 50 tasty recipes where every ingredient is a cancer-fighting food.  You can read sample chapters here: http://www.jefferyweaver.com/copy-of-book-inner This book NEEDS to get to market because, aside from being an inspirational story, the information we share may help to save someone's life. It can also help others to help themselves (over 70 percent of cancers can be prevented with diet alone).  Please join us in our fight against cancer by supporting this Kickstarter campaign. By helping us publish this book, you will have the satisfaction of knowing you may be responsible for saving the life of a mom, dad, friend, or family member. I have been self-funding this book so far because I believe in it. I have used my savings, worked two jobs, and spent hundreds of hours doing research; I even enrolled in college so I could take nutrition courses. Now I am asking for your help to raise $5,500.

A must-read for everyone."" —Digna Cassens, MHA, RDN, Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, Author, and Speaker * “Jeff Weaver’s book makes a powerful contribution in this scenario [nutrition as medicine]. Powerful, not because the outcome was lifesaving, which is brilliant and amazing in itself, but because the remedy involved utilizing the body’s own recuperative abilities without all the side effects of traditional cancer treatments. We see a genuinely honest and heartfelt attempt to incorporate a holistic and person-centered approach to dealing with a terminal case of cancer. This book is a road map, a template, that can hopefully be followed by any individual who feels abandoned by ‘Western Medicine.’ No claims are made that this book will work for everyone. Details are provided of what worked so successfully for Jeff and his wife, Susan. The body has incredible resilience and amazing powers of recuperation and recovery. To achieve this goal, we need to supply the body with the nutrients it requires, maximizing its fighting capacity and mobilizing all its resources, giving it a fighting chance!”  —Simon Davies, PhD, Professor of Kinesiology and Health, Irvine Valley College * “This book is a recipe for hope. Jeff Weaver’s intimate journey reminds us that lifestyle changes are not easy. Told with honesty, humor, and love, the story begins in anguish with his wife’s uncertain diagnosis for breast cancer. But, digging deep into the research, he finds a way forward not only for Susan but for himself and maybe for us all.”  —Marie Connors, Adjunct Professor of English, Irvine Valley College  * “The information [in the food section] is very well written and very clear—a great achievement!!! . . . Reading this has deepened my commitment to adhering to a cancer-fighting diet.”  —Kay Ryals, PhD, Professor of English, Head of the Honors Program, Irvine Valley College Jeff was born and raised in Myrtle Creek, Oregon.

The book's Illustrations provide clear instructions on acupressure and reflexology points, as well as helpful nutrition, movement, aromatherapy and meditation tips from licensed practitioners currently working in renowned pediatric oncology clinics.  Killian Mansfield originated the character of Grumpy Fish when he was dealing with cancer at age 11. His mother, Barbara Mansfield, along with practitioner Diane Rooney, L.Ac, LMT, Killian's dad Phil Mansfield, and illustrator Derrick Freeland are creating a new book based on one that was distributed to seven pediatric oncology hospital programs in three states between 2011 and 2013.

Little kids and old people get that, right? Not young people. Not in the prime of life. Not me.While my peers spent their senior year of college enjoying the freedoms of undergrad, my 21st year included frequent trips to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, learning what chemotherapy is, worrying about white blood cell counts, listening to my body's limits, and wondering what on earth I was doing with cancer. BACKGROUNDWhile support groups, activities, books, websites, and countless organizations exist for kids, men, and women with cancer, young adults are left alone to wonder what on earth they are doing with the disease. Frustrated with the lack of information for my demographic, I decided to do something about it. Having majored in English in college and having taught high school English, I have a passion for literature and the English language plus a knack for grammar. Most importantly, I am a cancer survivor and a normal, everyday young adult. Even if you don't have cancer, the odds are that 2/3 men and 3/5 women will have cancer in their lifetimes. And even if you aren't a young adult, since you probably know or will know someone who has cancer, this book is still relevant for you. What in the World are You Doing With Cancer? walks readers through my story--the story of an average 21-year-old who never thought she'd get cancer--from the earth-shattering call saying that I had lymphoma to my first chemotherapy treatment, shaving my head, and graduating from treatment four days after graduating from college. I recount the physical, emotional, and spiritual highs and lows of my journey, with the hope of offering encouragement and solidarity to other young adults facing this fight. I'm convinced that people connect through story, and every time I've shared my story or passed along my blog to others, they've been grateful to hear that someone else has gone through a similar situation. STATUSI've been working on What in the World are You Doing With Cancer? since August, and I've written all eleven chapters. At this point, I'm completing final editing and ready to move forward with publishing.  The only thing keeping this book from being published is the financial need, and for that, I need your help. In order to publish my book with WestBow Press (a division of Thomas Nelson Publishers), I need to pay for printing and distribution services. Since I spent the last two years teaching high school in Hawaii where the skies are blue but the rent and cost of living are astronomically high, my bank account is in a sad place.

I have spend the past several years exclusively dedicated to finding better solutions for preventing cancer and optimizing health, including focusing on anti-aging.  My discoveries and conclusions are so impactful that my inner-circle lives by them daily.  The protocols are easy, much easier than any diet you may have ever been on. This is a research-based driven protocol.  Through the international scientific research of just the past few years we have identified key molecules that are instrumental to our good health.  I have identified the food sources (plants and mushrooms) that maximally produce and concentrate these key molecules so that simply adding one bite of each of these to one's daily diet has a huge impact. In the book I clearly spell out my ""Essential Eight,"" the eight things that should be included in every daily diet to optimize these health-benefiting and anti-aging effects.  I've also included six bonus items which go on to target other conditions (such as high cholesterol).  The exact reasons for including each of these ""essentials"" in your diet are clearly detailed including the international research to back it all up. Problems addressed in the book go way beyond cancer to include a bevy of non-infectious disease states; dementia, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, asthma, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, high cholesterol, and macular degeneration. Does it work?  A now member of my inner-circle approached me six months ago.  His wife had been suffering with ulcerative colitis for over two years. Her diarrhea was so bad (12 times a day) that she could not leave the house.  Her doctors just kept prescribing more and more medications, and all along, her disease kept worsening.  She started my program.  Within two weeks she was down to having just two bowel movements a day and could now leave the house for the first time in two years.  Within two months she was symptom-free and on no medications. There are books out there written by bicycle riders talking about populations all around the world that live extraordinarily long and healthy lives. Unfortunately for all who have read these books, these authors haven't figured out ""why.""  I have!  It is all included within the book. Book-4, which is also completed (the research and the writing) details out how to treat (and cure) metastatic cancer in a side-effect free manor. Between books 3 and 4 there are 683 science journal references which put all of the pieces of the puzzle together.  Of course, you do not have to read them all, because I lay it all out in an easy to follow protocol within the conclusion of each book. Unfortunately with the cost of the research, I ran out of money to get the book into print.  I could go to a publishing house and have them pay for this essential step, but I would be giving up some of my rights to the books, and who's to say they wouldn't turn around and sell those rights to big-pharm who would just scrap the whole thing to prevent you, the population, from benefitting? Raised proceeds will go to the steps of publication that are out of my hands; formatting and layout, artwork, and printing of the book.  As the book is written and edited at this point, those final steps should simply take 2-3 months.  Further proceeds will go to establishing an internet site and advertising campaign to promote the book so that we can start getting America healthy.

I am writing a book. I have started
to practice saying this in front of the mirror at random intervals throughout
the day, at last dismissing the previous “I am TRYING to write a book” by using
the more Yoda-friendly gerund. It is a bit experimental in its form, and could
never been written even 10 years ago before the prominent existence of blogs, but it is
the way I have decided to express, explain, and describe one of the most
significant events of my life thus far.  Despite the quasi-jocular tone of
my Kickstarter approach, this book is in no way a comedy--understatement
alert! Ok...maybe in the Chekhovian
sense--nerd alert! But seriously,
there’s nothing overtly funny about the content or what happened, BUT—I’ve found more
and more that life is neither black, white, or grey—Life is colorful! More often than not life is ""AND"". In other words, although
it might make you cry, it's not a sob story-by-design. Rather, this is the story of my
life before, during, and after Dan—and those are the very real, very tangible
lines I’ve drawn in my head and in my heart.  It follows a distinct ""Susan-esque""
style, which might be enough of a description if you know me, but if you don't,
I can tell you it's like Story Soup (on a cold day, Story Stew). It's a sort of ""Nouveau
Memoire-style"". Interspersed with the words from the blog Dan
created during his year of treatment for cancer are my thoughts and
feelings Between those Lines...things unsaid or under-said. It's the
story of what ""brave"" would look like if it were a 10-pound bowling
ball handed over when your arms were full of cake. Because this has been a snippet-by-snippet work-in-progress over the past 4 years (a cheaper, albeit less scientific, form of therapy), the content and style has also morphed and adjusted. As the book progresses, we'll discover together the true ""style"" of the book as the Kick Starts to work its magic.  ""Part 2"": I explain the unfolding of what happened next…because when life-as-you-know-it dissolves before your eyes, you have two
choices—technically three: stand still, move forward, or move back. For
me, it would have been more difficult and would have dishonored Dan’s
memory to stand still, so I have chosen to move, move, move....sometimes forward and sometimes back. In writing this book, I hope to
reroute more of those movements in the forward direction. How will the funds be used? In addition to providing a sort of Instant Community, which is priceless, the funds generously donated to me will be used to do the following: * Create old-fashioned PHYSICAL BOOKS made from trees! In addition to offerring an e-book format, a modern-day convenience I have come to appreciate, the physical book will include photos colors that translate better and brighter in paper form...glorious glossy! * Allow me to format, edit, and overall ""compose"" this book with the assistance of professionals! It's my first book, after all. * Pack and ship these books to you and other hungry readers! It is also my goal to provide free copies to the various cancer hospitals and assistance organizations who were so generous to Dan and me. * Obtain that little bar code, the ISBN number and pay the various fees necessary to become listed in online e-and paper book stores. ""Captain Obvious"" Moment: The more funding I receive, the better the quality of hard copy book--and the more copies I can produce! STRETCH GOALS: Money above and beyond the minimum.  Let's face it, book writin' requires more than words. It eats up space and time like a 15-year old Michael Phelps, and since time is money, the more time I can devote to writing in a quiet space of my own, the less time I'll have to work as ""Bathroom Attendant #1"" on a Comedy Central half-hour series (true story...) I mean, think of the
power I'm handing over to you--the power to create time AND space! Incredible. I have a 5-year plan and need to fit your book into it ASAP. When will I be able to see the finished product? I have decided to give myself a solid year to complete the rest of the book. The fact is, I’ve already written bits and pieces (like around 50,000 words for Pete's sake--that's nuthin' to sneeze at, right?), but editing and organization/re-organization takes a lot of time, and the subject matter requires breathing space no matter HOW many hours I could potentially devote to sitting in front of the computer screen. I will provide monthly updates about my progress to backers and by the 6-month mark reassess the prospects for sending it to the publisher by early summer 2014. If all goes as planned, you may have the book in your hot little hands in time for beach reading, 2014! It will also mark 5-and-a-half years since Dan's passing.

To see her slowly lose her ability to write an email, to form complete sentences, to watch her sitting on the couch just staring at the remote control and after five minutes look at me and say, ""Matt, I don't know how to work this."" Through it all, I tried to lift her spirits, but usually she lifted mine instead. My Project: My brother handed me a journal when my wife, Lisa, was sick with cancer and pregnant with our third child. He thought it would be a good outlet for my fears. At the time, we were still hopeful Lisa could beat the disease and live a long life. During the next ten months there were a series of events I never thought I would experience. I kept a journal through it all and I am now turning it into a book.  During those trying times, friends and family kept saying they couldn't even imagine what our lives were like on a day-to-day basis. How did we keep going? Could they ever handle something like that if it happened to them? And that is the main reason I am writing this book.  This is an inside look during a time of losing someone you love, with a responsibility of moving forward for the sake of three young daughters. It is written in real time, day by day. I didn’t know what lay ahead. The story deals with emotion and the most difficult of decisions making, faced only with uncertain outcomes and worst fears. Every decision seemed like it might be the wrong one, every choice seemed like a 50 pound weight.  This is the story of Lisa and I trying to bring our unborn child safely into the world while preparing our other two daughters for life without Lisa. At the very same time, Lisa was preparing to lose her own Mom to cancer. We had two women, mother and daughter, living in the same house, both dying of cancer.  Judgments had to be made, that to this day, I hate that I made them. But I know full well that they had to be done, it was my role in all of this. It's a story filled with contradictions and catch-22's. Ironically, through it all, it was Lisa who kept us strong. She led us and willed our family to accept the sadness, to keep living life, and to look to the future. All that she was going through, she still took it upon herself to manage people around her. If you would like to see a sample of my writing style, please click on any of the links below. These are contributions I sometimes make to a widow blog.  I do not plan to include these in the book becauase they deal with our life after Lisa's death. http://widowsvoice-sslf.blogspot.com/2010/10/losing-memories.html  http://widowsvoice-sslf.blogspot.com/2010/04/rebuilding.html  http://widowsvoice-sslf.blogspot.com/2011/01/positive-side-of-awful.html  http://widowsvoice-sslf.blogspot.com/2010/06/tmi.html  http://widowsvoice-sslf.blogspot.com/2010/05/seperate-worlds.html  Where the book stands now: I wrote the journal as things were happening. I have since gone and added details that I didn't have time to include originally.  I have also put the story together so that it makes more sense to the reader. I have begun a second draft but hit a point where I need help if I am going to finish this in a professional matter. How your money will be spent: All donations, even if we make it over our goal, will allow me to finish this very personal project and self-publish this book. The more I can raise, the better I can complete this project. Funds will be used for everything that goes into self publishing; an editor, copywriter, artwork, professional advice, printing, ISBN number, etc.. Your donation will help me to give Lisa's story the justice she deserves. Some of the money will simply go toward hiring sitters to allow me time to work on the book. As you can imagine, it is very difficult to find time to write with a full-time job and three young girls to raise. Every dollar spent on this project will be listed, so the donors know where all the money was spent. A timetable of how the book is progressing will be listed. If there are any questions about my project that I haven’t addressed, please feel free to email me.  Thank you for your support and interest in this story. I would like to believe that this book can be helpful in understanding some of the inner struggles that goes along with the obstacles of losing a loved one.

Well we do it by poking fun at it. I (Michael) wrote my story of prostate cancer - which is pretty much pee, poo, and (no) boners. It really is just one big set-up for laughs. My brother (Jon) did what he does best, and made funny, sad, and mostly weird cartoons to help break the ice and start real conversations. Our Dad even kicked in a few drawings for old time's sake.  I may not have long to live, but at least I'm enjoying the ride. (Jon hates it when I say things like that.) I want to share my story as we think it can help others with their own journeys, and to make people laugh at something that's quite painful.  I have found that so many guys have a hard time talking about things like this, whether its cancer or an illness in general. It can be awkward, embarrassing, and even a little emasculating.  Screw that. This is my life. This is your life. There is no shame in getting sick. But there is a problem if we can no longer talk to each other like normal human beings. In your face humour is how we were raised. We may not be able to cure cancer with a bunch of bad jokes, but we think we can mock the hell out of it. Want to help us out? Here is our first cut at a book cover for Finger Up The Bum! What's in the book, you ask? Is it funny, is it sad, is it personal, is it about health, is it cartoons? Its all of them, but not in one neat little box. Its real life...  Finger Up The Bum is written and the illustrations look great. The words and images need some polish, but the heavy lifting is done.  But we want to give you a taste...let you wet your beak a little. Here is a mock up of what the book might look like. It includes one of Jon's great cartoons, and a sample of Michael's more better writing.  In order to publish, we need to raise some cash. Not big big bucks, but some bucks.  We aren't experienced in the book world so we want to hire a team of pros to help us do everything right - the layout, the printing, the E-Book, the paper copy, distribution, etc. We have a great supportive team lined up, Page Two Strategies. They will get all of that done for us, and scope out the right printer. They will also get us into the online world, and the old fashioned brick and mortar book sellers.   The chart here is a breakdown of how we will spend the money we raise.  If we are lucky enough to hit our target with your help, then we can make it go, and print in colour (or color in the good old USofA). If we raise even more money, we can do a bigger first run. We could then do some real marketing, beyond having my daughter Chloe (one of the Cancer Dancers from the video), walk up and down Main Street in a Finger Up The Bum sandwich board.   So check out the rewards, and make a pledge. Most of the rewards include a copy of Finger Up The Bum, which you will want of course. But what you really want - and its only available through some of the rewards - is you very own Allan the Angry Prostate high-end Giclee (or similar) print. Quite frankly, its the coolest thing you've ever seen. What started out as a simple project, writing a story mostly for friends and family, has turned into quite the beast.

Robyn and I are very, very humbled and grateful. I believe it's significant we hit the goal on Good Friday, because our desire has been that the Lord would use for good what the enemy meant for destruction.  The plan has been to give 10% of net proceeds to YoungLives, a ministry to teen moms and their babies in Northwest Arkansas. We'll be able to increase that percentage the more we exceed goal. We'll also be able to include more content in the book. I really like that, because there's more to be shared than we have room for in just 40 devotionals. Robyn always kicks me under the table when I talk for too long. This will be my chance to keep going! :)  We'll have a better feel for all this once we know the final amount pledged.  And I've got some other thoughts in the works! Please know our heart is to provide more value to you and to give more to YoungLives. THANK YOU AGAIN!! DISCLAIMER: I mentioned it in the video, but it's important enough to repeat. Robyn and I are NOT claiming that you will experience physical healing as a result of working through this book. What we do believe is that seeking God and believing the truth allows us to experience the very best the Lord has for us, no matter what we're going through. The greatest healing we've experienced is from the wrong beliefs we'd held onto for too many years. A few days before Christmas, my wife, Robyn, began to bruise easily for no apparent reason. Right after Christmas, she had an appointment with our family doctor. After reviewing the lab results, he immediately referred her to an oncologist. So two days before New Year's Eve, Robyn had a bone marrow biopsy, after which the nurse practitioner told us to make a follow-up appointment for January 8th. She also said to hope they didn't call sooner, which would mean they'd found something serious. On the morning of New Year's Eve, less than 48-hours after the biopsy, we got the call we hoped we wouldn't get. Robyn was diagnosed with leukemia. We learned it was a treatable and curable type of leukemia, but required immediate, aggressive treatment. We were told to get to the hospital that day to begin chemotherapy. Since Robyn's treatment began, I've posted a daily update to Facebook on her condition and the spiritual lessons we've been learning. Along the way, a number of people encouraged me to put the updates into a devotional. This project is the result. The book is called, ""I Believe God: a 40-day healing journey."" In it, I share the life-changing truths we've experienced, but much more important, how you can apply them as well.    I'm already in the process of editing the posts and have secured a quote for both printing and fulfillment from a printer I've worked with previously. One of my greatest desires is to help others believe God. I've written almost 700 posts on that subject. When I say ""believe God,"" don't mean believe that He simply exists. I mean believe that He's good, He's faithful and He's generous. That He's ready to do far more in us and for us and through us than we've imagined. And that the key is to take Him at His word. That's why I'm putting this book together.  The book will be about 120-pages (soft cover) and will help you experience the Lord and chronicle your 40-day journey with Him...what He's saying to you, prayers He's answering and how He's encouraging you to believe Him. The goal is NOT to simply gain more knowledge, but to renew your mind so you think more like He does and encounter Him in a life-changing way. Robyn and I invite you to support the project and hopefully share it with friends who you'd like to join with you in experiencing God's very best.  10% of net proceeds (after paying for design, printing and fulfillment) will be donated to a ministry Robyn and I love, YoungLives of Northwest Arkansas, a ministry to teen moms and their babies. If we exceed the funding goal, we'll be able to increase the amount of our gift. Robyn and I had fun doing the project video, but it wasn't without a few mistakes.

My son Andrew was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia aged 3 and 5 months on 3rd October 2012. I communicated our journey to friends and family through Facebook posts.  Wednesday 3rd October 2012 Andrew was diagnosed with leukaemia today. Curable. Such a brave boy.  

Over the 1235 days of treatment my daily posts formed a diary of our experiences; the high, lows and frustrations. I also shared details of all the many charities who helped us along the way by giving us opportunities for silver linings on the big black cloud of cancer.  

This book is a record for Andrew and Clara so that they know how resilient, brave and strong they have been. However, I want to raise awareness of childhood cancer by sharing our story with parents, friends and families of children in the same situation as Andrew. I want to give hope to families put in our situation that children can beat cancer.  

The book is also for doctors, nurses and medical professionals to read to understand what treatment is like from a family’s point of view. I want to give thanks to these people because 96% of children survive leukaemia nowadays thanks to the NHS and modern research.  

I have a quote of £300 to edit the book and a further £900 to do the design and final publish of the book from a company called I am Self Publishing https://www.iamselfpublishing.com/ so I am raising the money to ensure this can happen. Thank you!

Have 1,000 people totally wrapped into this movement of Courageous Living in the face of it all. I am SUPER excited about the Courageous Wellness Kit! Here is a little more info on that:  Hi. My name is Katie. The simple version of my story is this: when I was 30, I was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer. Despite a year of nasty treatments, the cancer ended up spreading, and at 31, I was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. Since then, I’ve been on a wild ride trying to find a way to slow this cancer down and “get on with living my life”.  The real version of my story is a bit more intense. I was living the average life of a busy, Type A, overly committed 30-something when crisis and illness ravaged my body, stole my identity and damaged or destroyed almost everything that gave my life meaning including my career, my relationships and my shot at having a family.  After wrangling with tremendous grief, fear and anger I discovered that the only way to find meaning again would be through embracing whatever life I had left, and this would require traveling to new depths with myself.  I had a new goal. One bigger than ""crushing cancer."" And it was this: to get so present with life, so connected with my body, and so engaged with the world that even if I died, I would have lived a healed and powerful life. This is not a book about illness and dying. This is a book about deep wellness and powerful living.  I have written this because I want you to know that you are not alone in the messy work of making meaning in our lives and I want you to live your one, wild, beautiful life all in.  In The Courage Club, I give you true stories and tested resources to help with audacious, courageous, wholehearted living.  Cancer, crisis, or not, this book is meant to give a megaphone to the voice inside each of us that is saying: Now is the time to find happiness. Today is the day to start living. ",73.97625508819539,415,25,2.726025,28.713622685185186,5,1,2016,1,1,25,breast cancer,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

Dig In Your Heels: Refuse to give in; To act in a determined manner by firmly maintaining one’s beliefs, demands, situation, etc. in the face of opposition. That’s what I did upon learning that I had breast cancer.  I was determined not to let everyone fall apart around me so I had to set the tone.   The news took me totally off guard being that I was thirty-four and had no real family history of the disease.  Naturally, my life flashed before my eyes when I got the diagnosis. Looking back, I was so glad that I had followed my dream of living in Paris, France just one year prior.  There are many messages in Dig In Your Heels but one of the most important is to follow your dreams because you never know how short life will be. This past July, I learned that after almost seven years being cancer-free, my cancer is back and has spread to my spine.  So I'm digging in my heels once again, maintaining my positive outlook on life, and moving forward with realizing my dream of becoming an author.     When I was initially battling breast cancer, I read several breast cancer memoirs and all of them covered the timeframe from diagnosis to the end of treatment.  I was always left wondering what happened after that.  Was the author still alive?  Were they one of the lucky ones to make it five years without a recurrence?  What should I expect after treatment?  What would my “new normal” be like? So around two years into my journey, I set out to write a memoir about making it to the five year cancer-free milestone where many breast cancer survivors consider themselves cured.  Thankfully, I made it and despite my most recent diagnosis I am looking forward to celebrating many more years as a breast cancer survivor.  I'm already planning the sequel to Dig In Your Heels. Once Dig In Your Heels is published, 10% of the proceeds will go to support breast cancer research and outreach. The money raised from the Kickstarter campaign will go to publishing and marketing the book (editing, cover design, publishing in digital, paperback, and hard cover, promotional materials, author photos, etc.) and producing the rewards. The launch party is not included in the budget.  However, there will definitely be a party.  The date and location is TBD. First of all, you can back this project. You can give from one dollar to ten thousand dollars.  No gift is too small but I’m hoping you will give enough to receive a copy of the book.  For gifts of one hundred dollars or more, you will receive your name in the acknowledgements section of the book (if you so wish) and an invitation to the launch party.  I’d love to commemorate your contribution to the book and party with you.  You can pledge at any time.  Your card will not be processed until the campaign ends on Nov 30th. All it will take to reach the $10K goal is 100 people with $100. Secondly, you can spread the word about the campaign.  Email your contacts the link to this page or click on the Facebook and Twitter icons under the video to share it with your friends and followers.  Be sure to use the hashtag #diginyourheels.  ",84.71428571428571,622,39,1.3046,60.041666666666664,10,2,2014,1,1,26,breast cancer,1,1,1,1,0.001607717041800643,0.001607717041800643,0.3885933806146572,1.9922255589078908,1.0,kickstarter

""60 Days..."" began as a humble stack of notecards, bound by a keyring and adorned with a post-it note reading ""38 Days to A Radiating Faith,"" by Hannah Chambers Trickett, my sister. Inspired by a friend - who earlier in the week had slipped a few notecards with Bible verses in Hannah's mailbox to encourage her - she wrote one verse for each radiation treatment that our dad would have for his prostate cancer. He carried the cards in his back pocket and frequently shared their contents with fellow patients in the waiting room, with his doctors and their staff, and with anyone else willing to listen. After sharing his story - and a verse - with a woman awaiting her daily treatment, she encouraged us to create a book of verses that could be shared with others. We took her advice and created and self-funded a small, black and white booklet of sixty verses - two full months of faith-building. The two hundred copies we originally printed were gone within weeks, with a number of requests still coming in! We would like to produce a newly redesigned 4"" x 5"" pocket-sized book. This perfect bound book will have a heavyweight, color cover and sixty pages of verses accompanied by an introduction. Each page features a single verse alongside the treatment number, working backwards from 60 down to 1. Readers of the book are instructed to turn to the page that matches the number of treatments they have remaining (38 for my dad) and begin the countdown to the end of their treatment. The beauty of this book is in the sharing of it, just as a friend shared verses with Hannah, Hannah shared verses with our dad, he shared verses with fellow patients, and now we want to share this printed and bound book with the world.  Backers will also receive wonderful rewards that they can enjoy for themselves, or that can be given as a gift of inspiration to an acquaintance undergoing cancer treatments. Copies of the book, as well as digital wallpapers, posters like the one below, and notecards - each adorned with some of our favorite verses from the collection - can be yours to share by backing this project.",72.42857142857143,555,22,1.014,30.0,3,2,2013,1,1,20,prostate cancer,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

I'm Shelly Straub. Thanks for checking out the Kickstarter campaign for my first book, A Tale of 2 Boobies: One Year With Cancer. It means everything to me that you're here. Please read on. This has been a healing journey for me and I know the process isn't 
over.  I remember just after hearing that I had cancer, my better half 
took me to Barnes N Noble so I could search for a book to read that 
would help me understand.  I am now writing the book that I wished I 
could have found.  There is a plethora of available reference books and 
cancer stories from other survivors, but none that put the order of one 
full year after diagnosis into an organized perspective that I could 
understand. And better yet, with photos that showed the true devastation
 of the treatment and actual changes of the body, such as breast and 
hair! My story can be summed up very well in a letter I wrote to cancer... Dear Cancer, If there is one thing I have learned, it is that ‘YOU are not the enemy.’ Cancer kills.  That statement alone would lead anyone to believe that you are the devil in disguise or the terrorist that needs to be taken down.  However we choose to view it, you are an invader and one thing is for certain – no one wants to be on the opposing side of you. I am not one of those people that will say how grateful I am that you came into my life because I have a whole new positive perspective now that you have given me a brush with death.  No, not me.  I am not grateful, I am angry.  I am grateful for my anger.  The anger has given me the strength to fight you.  Since you walked into my life one year ago, I have driven to over 70 doctors appointments, have had 3 surgeries, have been poked dozens of times by numerous different medical professionals, have been physically and emotionally unwell, have been unable to attend my children’s social functions, have lost my breasts and my hair, and I have become an incredibly insecure person whom I do not recognize.  One year ago, a nurse told me that my positive attitude would get me through this.  I cynically thought to myself – bullshit! It’s not my mind that has the problem, it’s my body.  The surgery, the chemo, the radiation, and the drugs will get me through this! Well, they certainly helped but the truth is that she was right. One year later, after graduating from all the treatments, I am still angry at you for this terrorist invasion, but I know my worst enemy is my own mind and that if I allow you to take my sanity, you will have won. I am here to say GAME OVER. You lost, I won. With a sarcastic wink, I say ‘Good luck to you in the future'. Sincerely, A Survivor My memoir, A Tale of 2 Boobies, chronicles both my experience, as well as tips and knowledge for the newly diagnosed.  Also included in this book, are exclusive photos of my breasts and the transformation to implants that has taken place over this past year, which is the reason for the parental advisory label on the cover.   ***
THE BOOK IS 90% COMPLETE, BUT YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS CAMPAIGN GETS IT PUBLISHED AND DISTRIBUTED. My goal is to release the book in December 2014. It's just about ready to publish, but I need your assistance with getting to the finish line. If you are able to pledge some money (buy the book in advance) to help fund this project, know that I am forever grateful along with the potential readers this book will impact. If you can't afford it or just don't want to, I completely understand. Please support the campaign by sharing the link to this page. I'm thankful for that too.  Your generous pledges will go to the printing, copy editing, design, and distribution of the book.  The costs to produce this book include:  - Copy Editing & Proofreading: the final step is always to get a professional copy editor and proofreader to give it a final once over before going to print.  - Printing the book is the bulk of the cost. - Distribution: This is probably the smallest line item in the budget, but there nonetheless. Amazon.com, iTunes, and copyright registration costs pertain here. There are also mailing boxes, packing tape, and a hefty amount of postage/shipping costs. Based on your level of support, there are all sorts of different gifts in store for you. All pledges will receive some sort of reward, whether it is a copy of the book, an ebook, or recognition in the book as a survivor or supporter of a survivor. Please remember how Kickstarter works: if we're even a dollar short of our goal, the project does NOT get funded. So, I have given a bare minimum budget. Even if we achieve the full amount before the campaign ends, some people might not be able to fulfill their pledge. That means we need a comfortable margin, above the goal amount. If we blow through the number, that just means there will be budget for me to send more books to more people! I am thrilled to be able to share my journey and hope that it helps someone in the future.  That would be the only worthwhile reward to this whole breast cancer battle.

just after my latest collection of poetry, Wild
In The Plaza of Memory was released, I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.  Ovarian
cancer.I didn’t expect those words to
come out of my gynecologist's mouth.They slammed into me like bullets from an automatic rifle.The exit wounds were huge.Ovarian cancer has so often been a death
sentence for women.Difficult to diagnose,
spreading rapidly as fire through bear grass, ovarian cancer is almost never
diagnosed before it has reached stage 4.End game.When the gynecologist
in Durango told my husband and me, ""all the tests indicate you have
ovarian cancer” the room went blind. By the time of my surgery, my cancer
was Stage 3.Long story short, I was
referred to the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, where I underwent major surgery performed
by a world-renowned ovarian cancer expert for the cancer’s removal. Six months
of brutal and intensive chemotherapy followed.During this year long odyssey in the domain of cancer, I wrote a short
poem each day in my journal to keep my spirit alive. After chemotherapy, I began writing this book
to fight fear, to fight pain, to fight depression, those monstrous and noisy
relatives of cancer.This book is an inquiry into the nature of
healing, as a map to help and give hope to other women diagnosed with dire
disease, and it is a way to pull myself through this agonizing process of chemo
itself.  I am about one hundred pages into this mixed-genre work.It combines memoir, the poetry and poetry
fragments I wrote daily to keep myself alive, and interviews with all the
healers who have helped me along the way from my brilliant doctors at the Mayo
Clinic to a Mexican currendera, to a
Tohono O’odham medicine woman to psychics to energy healers to an acupuncturist
and other practitioners around the country. Neuropathy’s
ice blocks each step, chemo’s aftershocks
from sole to fingertips to my bald head,  where
I try to reconfigure a path, the  exact
trajectory back to human. I do not know if I am cured.That
is an unknown.What I do know is that when
ovarian cancer is discussed, misconceptions are involved. It has been considered a death sentence for
women, but it no longer has to be.I am
“in remission,” I am doing well, but the psychological scars I must deal with
are as deep as the scars from the surgery and the side-effects from chemo
combined.It’s taken a community of healers to pull me
through this.Aside from human healers,
I also explore the natural world as healer both in the narrative and in the
poems.My own old and deep connection
with the spirit world has also been essential in my healing.Without the balm from all of these elements,
I might not be here.Poetry, itself, and
the passion to write, to create metaphor out of darkness, also plays its vital
part in healing.“In a dark time,” Theodore
Roethke so wisely wrote, “the eye begins to see.”From my poem, “Meteoric,” April, 2013: In
Russia, my people, believing in beauty again, rush  to
windows awed by a meteor’s sheer arc  burning
the pure acetylene spine over snow before
the panes shattered, blasting glass into
their stunned familiar faces. This
is the rapture that wounds. Take
love and its singed finch wings recovering
after the surgeon’s laser sliced
through my abdomen,  maneuvering
the DaVinci robot to
remove the organs of my making. Why
does hysterectomy begin with
its mouth open to scream? I have not only conducted phone and paper interviews, I have interviewed
healers in person (my preferred method).I will travel to interview other
healers at a distance who were instrumental in my survival.My poetry has often been set in countries
where I’ve traveled.Several poems in Wild In The Plaza of Memory are set in
Northern India, in Ladahk and Dharamsala, where I took undergraduate students
to study Tibetan refuge communities, Tibetan Buddhism, and Tibetan Buddhist
sacred poetry.Poems such as “A Short
History of Falling,” (included in Best of
the Web, 2010) and “Focus of the Mind’s Labyrinth,” (appeared first in Hunger Mountain) deal with healing and
came out of this life-changing trip.Travel,
landscape, place, figure largely in this book.This is a big project, one very important to all women diagnosed with
ovarian cancer and to all the care-takers, family and friends of these women
who are also affected by life-threatening disease.  One in three people contract cancer.In the past few months, I have
begun reading excerpts from this book in public programs at universities and
bookstores.The scale and intensity of
response has been overwhelming.  Christian Wiman’s memoir, My
Bright Abyss, about coming to terms with his own terminal cancer is a
seminal work.My book is a woman’s story
of being reduced to the most basic struggle for survival, a story of suffering,
of fear, of the path back to good health.This book is a love poem ultimately, the story of all the people around
me--of my husband, my sisters and family, fellow writers and the vast network
of friends I am lucky enough to enjoy, who live all over the country.Through narrative, through poetry, through interviews
with healers of all sorts, my search is the eternal human search for survival
through healing the body and the spirit. As I write in the forward: Some
people call me a miracle.That is not my
claim.Others shake their heads, lower
their eyes, whisper, horrible.Others
laugh, give me a high five, congratulate me on beating ovarian cancer.I don't think it’s an enemy that anyone
beats.I do not claim to be healed.Healing doesn't happen in one scimitar slash,
one flash of lightning or revving of hands to heat. Like building a house, real
healing is a process, a tao, a way sometimes so imperceptible you must hold a
breath feather over its mouth to tell if it is still alive.It cannot
be accomplished by one person.It takes
an orchestra of healers, a symphony composing itself and performing in multiple
keys.",52.686868686868685,1053,17,1.0432,32.52842592592592,10,1,2013,1,1,19,general,4,0,4,0,0.003798670465337132,0.0,0.1491347132677299,25.459048297239086,6.484509501839949,kickstarter

Project is the creative result of my journey with breast cancer. The project
focuses on the publication and promotion of a book I’ve written called The Booby Blog: A Cancer Chronicle, in e-book and printed formats. It’s
a book about my experiences with breast cancer that I think will help other
women survive it, and help those who love them understand what having breast
cancer can be like. The book is very honest, sometimes painful, and
surprisingly funny.  The book is a combination of ""The Booby Blog,"" which I wrote to friends and family while I was sick, and entries in my private journal about my cancer. It's a book about the “inside job” of struggling with cancer—my feelings and thoughts and fears and questions,
like, How badly is this going to hurt?
and Is this going to kill me? and What will my body look like after this? and Who can I talk to about this, really? I
need your help to finance the publication and promotion of The Booby Blog. You can imagine the expenses involved: editing,
graphic design, website assistance, social media marketing, publicity,
production, distribution, travel to readings. I’m doing all that I can myself,
but some aspects demand professional assistance. In addition to funding publication of the book, your contribution will help me promote it through free   workshops for women with breast
cancer called “Empowering Ourselves to Heal,” and a
monologue I'm creating,
called My Left Breast, that demonstrates
just how absurd the whole cancer experience can be. Like the Booby Blog book, its aim in part is to
allow us to laugh at cancer. So
I hope you’ll decide this is a project worthy of your support. It’s my dream
that The Booby Blog Project will
offer a sense of connection, comfort and hope to other women (and men) with
breast cancer and those who support them. Please check out the excerpts on my

praise for The Booby Blog: A Cancer
Chronicle   The
  Booby Blog is one of the most engaging accounts
  of illness I have ever read. In her journey through breast cancer, Hollis
  Walker peels back layers of experience to reveal psychological and spiritual
  insights that are the goal of a lifetime. This is a true heroine’s journey—someone
  who braves the dangers with exceptional courage, who then returns to share
  wisdom gained. This beautifully written account is seasoned with hope and
  humor, and will uplift and inspire anyone who reads it. —Larry Dossey, M.D.,
  author of One Mind: How Our Individual
  Mind Is Part of a Greater Consciousness and Why It Matters Hollis Walker’s new book, The Booby Blog, takes us by surprise with fresh discovery and soul-making as she walks day by day through diagnosis and treatment of breast of cancer. Her candid reflections help open our hearts and minds to the healing complexity such a journey requires. Hollis’s playful, witty and soulful trek touches universal human experiences so nakedly that we all are potentially moved into deeper connection with Self and soul as a result. Her remarkable human transparency and the ability to write from this quality takes us as readers into luminous territory. This book is a must-read for women being touched by the call to heal through facing illness. —Monika Wikman, Ph.D., author of Pregnant Darkness: Alchemy and the Rebirth of Consciousness  [The Booby Blog] is so fresh, so
  relevant and so intimate. Wonderful how you were able to journal in the midst
  of your experience with such vulnerability and openess. I would buy this book
  for every one of my friends with cancer. You remain authentic and hopeful and
  so human in the face of fear, darkness, mystery and patriarchal authority. —Amy
  Sayers, breast cancer survivor I found it deeply personal and honest,
  funny, and insightful. You looked at the process of finding oneself
  ""sick"" and the path to wellness in a way that takes the reader
  along for the ride.  As a nurse who has gone through a breast cancer  diagnosis, complete with my own lumpectomies and radiation, so much of what
  you say about the medical establishment really resonates.  Some folks
  are kind and really ""see"" you, while others barely seem
  to notice that you're actually in the room with them, or
  acknowledge that you're an adult with your own sense of personal
  autonomy.  ...I really think that anyone who has
  cancer, had cancer, or knows someone with cancer would benefit from reading
  your book. —Shelby Morales, R.N., breast cancer survivor",128.22033898305085,796,38,1.0086666666666666,30.0,8,0,2014,1,1,20,breast cancer,0,5,0,2,0.0,0.00628140703517588,0.01103657217052586,0.0,7.242254750919974,kickstarter

If you enjoy what you see, please feel free to support me by sharing this site with your friends through Twitter or Facebook. Your support is greatly appreciated!* It would be easy to say this project began on June 7th, 2009, the day I was diagnosed with a Grade II Oligoastrocytoma brain tumor. But the story actually begins much earlier. It began when I was ten years old, looking at myself in the mirror, and somehow knowing I was born to tell my story. Knowing I was created to affect the lives of those around me, offering hope and a unique promise. But over the next 20 years, my unique story never showed up. But in those twenty years, I was determined. I won awards, continually set myself apart, married a beautiful blonde, and essentially succeeded at living the American dream. Still unable to tell ""my"" story, I started my own company to share the stories of others. Dot&Cross was a creative storytelling business that partnered with unique storytellers like Rob Bell, Marcus Buckingham, Don Miller, Tim Keller, Francis Chan, Josh Shipp, and Erik Wahl, as well as non-profits like Compassion International, World Vision, and Trans World Radio. If I couldn't figure out a story to tell for myself, I would make myself influential in telling others' stories. But June 7th, 2009 eventually showed up. And through a crazy kung-fu related bump on the head, I suffered a grand mal seizure and was rushed by ambulance to Stanford Hospital. Later that day, I was told I had terminal brain cancer. I was given, at most, five to seven years to live. I made several difficult phone calls to share with my then-wife, my parents, my three sisters, and my business partners. The majority of them flew out to California to be with me during this time where I questioned God's reasoning for this unexpected tragedy. But then it occurred to me. Maybe this is the beginning of my unique story. When I returned home, I determined to make lemonade out of lemons. I was truthfully overcome with the brilliance of living and with every breath that entered my nostrils. Remembering that ten-year-old's dream, I offered to share my story at no cost to groups of people across the country. I spoke forty times that year at elementary schools, nursing homes, colleges, STORY Conference in Chicago, and Catalyst Conference in Atlanta. I was finally sharing MY story! During my travels, I spoke of cancer and its effect on the relationship between God and myself. But at the same time, I started having trouble in my marriage. My wife disapproved of my speaking despite the fact I knew THIS was the exact thing I was created to do! We suffered through another year of marriage before she determined she was finished with me. The girl of my dreams divorced me. I was heartbroken. For two years I lived in a blur somewhere between life and death. With no interest in fighting with her for our physical possessions, I used my airline miles to travel for six months. Then I stayed at my sister's house for more than a year. I had lost all hope in love and was so confused as to why God had allowed this at such a critical point in my life. I hate to admit it, but I was approaching permanent indifference. During those years, I met a girl who had also suffered a divorce. She became my confidante as I struggled to get my quickly fading life back in order. Over time she developed feelings for me, but I was too blind to see it. I was still focused on looking backwards, trying to figure out how things had ended up so horribly wrong.  We became quite close that second year. I would even say we became best friends. But apparently, with several glasses of bourbon, a forward woman can become quite convincing. I regret to admit we ended up having a one night stand. My faint drunk memories recalled my concerns, but was met with the explanation of her doctors previously declaring her womb barren. To her, she was suffering a life with no hope for children. But to me, she served as a simple relief. Just a rare one-night stand as I tried to forget my miserable past.  Two weeks later, I got a call. Barren no more, Lori informed me I had managed to get her pregnant. Something her previous partner was incapable of doing despite their honest and planned out attempts. My life had somehow gotten even worse. I was now THAT guy. Lori was my best friend so I determined I would be a part of her and this baby's life. Three months passed before her belly started to show. Eyebrows were raised and we knew we had to come clean. I wrote a post on my blog and winced as I hit the ""publish"" button.  It doesn't get much worse than being drunk and getting a girl pregnant, but now I have to admit this horrible mistake to the general public . But oddly enough, I was met with love. So much love from my family, my friends, and even strangers. In the Spring of 2014, we gave birth to our surprise daughter and named her Marian, a name with two meanings; ""bitter"" and ""long-awaited child.""   Lori and I initially dealt with the struggle of how our relationship began, but she turned out to be my perfect partner. Since then she has made me the happiest man on the planet. In fact, we recently (and intentionally) gave birth to our second daughter, Viola, on the exact same day as Marian. The day of Marian's birth - the birth that began as a horrible mistake - seems to have been redeemed by God through this second child, the one we joyfully made together. Now we can celebrate their respective birthdays on the same day as a family. God told me I would live a unique story when I was ten years old. I had no idea then, but this story would include how terminal cancer has the potential to bring me back to an even better life, of how divorce is incredibly painful but can lead me to find my perfect partner, and how a sinful one-night stand can somehow be redeemed by God to give birth (pun intended) to a perfect second life with a perfect second family. This story is full of seizures in my favorite restaurants, the showers at the Y, and 35,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean. This story is about the ongoing battle between alternative and conventional treatments. This story is about heartbroken lonely walks past my old home, weeping over the person I'd lost. This story is about surviving the public shame of knocking up a girl, only to discover an entirely happy life waiting on the other side.  My agent proposed this story to a wide range of publishers. Too spiritual to be published by secular publishers, and too secular to be published by spiritual publishers, I was left in the middle.

It looks like we will be officially funded! For those of you who are considering donating in our last 24 hours, we have many hard costs associated with the project, so anything over and above will still be put to good use. We are overwhelmed and humble and grateful right now!  WHY? Breast cancer is not pink, pretty, funny, sexy, nor the good kind of cancer.  At least one out of eight women and some men (possibly you or a loved one) will suffer from breast cancer in her or his lifetime.  Speaking from experience, we know that the scariest part of any journey is the unknown. Imagine the power of knowing that other survivors have made it through a breast cancer diagnosis and are not only surviving, but thriving! Two amazing breast cancer survivors–diagnosed in their 30’s–found that sharing their experiences from diagnosis to living with and moving beyond cancer was critical to their well rounded life after breast cancer. WHAT? Our book, There Is Life After Breast Cancer is a compilation of creative talents and stories of breast cancer survivors and their loved ones.  Including both touching and humorous stories, our contributors hail from many different backgrounds and parts of the world. There Is Life After Breast Cancer packs big doses of courage and wisdom by letting survivors use their own words and artwork to inspire others.  WHEN? Our content is ready to print and we need funds to help us self-publish our spectacular 150+ page full color book. As soon as we get that pretty green bar on our Kickstarter page that says “FUNDING SUCCESSFUL!!”, we are ready to rock!  We know it’s all or nothing with Kickstarter––our project must be fully funded or no money changes hands.

It was time to get help. My “dark days” were becoming more frequent, more long lasting and the dark feelings were becoming more severe. Very quickly, I was diagnosed with depression, sent for CBT and put on antidepressants. What happens then, while you’re figuring out who you are with depression, trying to learn techniques for dealing with it and how to live with it, when you’re diagnosed with breast cancer, aged 26. Cue a whole new world of uncertainty, a double whammy of mental anguish and a(n un)healthy amount of worrying. And a whole lot of trying to find humour in the very, very darkest of places. How do you not fall apart? You can’t. Sometimes you do fall apart. But you get back up and you piece yourself back together, even on the days you think you can’t bear to. Life, Lemons and Melons is one girl’s story of figuring out life when it hands you a whole heap of lemons and you don’t have the energy to make lemonade or even reach for the gin. It’s a funny story about things that aren’t that funny and a coming of age story that came a few years later (or earlier) than expected. It’s about mortality, health, the pressures of the modern world, trying to be positive when your heart feels like it’s being repeatedly trodden on by an elephant and finding humour in getting diagnosed with breast cancer aged 26 when you carry a black dog around with you every day. It’s essentially about the life of every twenty something - but with some added mental anguish and the mild inconvenience which is cancer thrown into the mix. A recipe for disaster? Maybe. A good story? Hopefully. The book will be made up of personal experience essays to present a full picture of what it’s like living with depression and then being diagnosed with cancer. Cos life is sometimes super kind. You can get a feel for my writing and what the book'll be like here. I'm hoping that this book will help anyone who's ever heard the words ""it's breast cancer"" or who's ever had a battle with their brain.

After crying a lot, we decided to stop feeling sorry for ourselves and to lean on God.  We prayed that He would make our journey meaningful no matter what the outcome.  We wanted it to matter and trusted that He would use our pain and suffering to inspire people in a way that would make a difference.           In late June, I started a Facebook page to update everyone who was praying for my wife during her battle.  Along the way, I began sharing the story of how we met.  People were being added daily by members that joined our page and before the first month had ended, it grew from 180 to over 600 members.  By the end of month two we had over 1,000 members following our story and praying for her.          People began sharing with us how God was using our story in their own lives, which was very humbling.  Followers of our page began expressing how much they enjoyed reading my posts.  Some stated that they woke up each morning early just to search for the latest post (I normally posted at night) and many suggested that I write a book.  I assumed they were just being kind, but the seed was planted.  The burden kept weighing on me and I decided to seek God for help.  After praying many times, I felt that God was telling me that this was the moment to make a difference and I should act on it.          Between the front and back cover of Pray Hard & Speak Life you will learn about how our family dealt with addictions, bankruptcy, suicide, cancer and how I began to walk with Jesus in the midst of it all.  I trust that you will not only enjoy reading Pray Hard & Speak Life,but you will be inspired to influence others who are battling similar struggles to read it as well.           Pray Hard & Speak Life is complete and with your help, I am planning on publishing through a well known Christian publishing company.  They publish worldwide and my book will be on a list that over thirty thousand book stores use to select their merchandise.  The funds generated through Kickstarter will cover all publication costs, a completed graphic for the front and back cover (I am pushing for something very similar to what I have above) and professional editing.   ~ I am very honored that you are considering backing my project.  You are a true blessing and very much appreciated!!  ~ Give to my project and earn rewards, scroll up and look to the right for a complete listing!    ~ Below is a sample of the tin painting which will come with a donation of $200.00 or more.",115.0,470,23,1.0663636363636364,30.0,4,2,2015,1,1,14,general,1,1,1,1,0.002127659574468085,0.002127659574468085,0.0861003861003861,3.2165534418685358,1.0,kickstarter

survival. Mostly. My mom passed away, busy as ever, before reaching the final stages of publishing her autobiography, Whatever Happened to Patient 2410. Although she didn't have the chance to publish this book, with your help, her story can become a shared reality.   While Whatever Happened to Patient 2410 is told through a timeline of medical traumas, it is Minda’s psyche and outlook that make this a book for all to read. It is not a “cancer survival book” but a life-long illustration of the incredible resilience of the human spirit. This is a
story about a life philosophy – shaped by life experiences that very few people
have. What happens when you spend your life knowing that you are a few turns
away from death? What sort of ups and downs do you go through? Would that change the way you face major challenges? It's the humanity of her writing and often laugh out loud hilarity that makes this a truly compelling and heartfelt story. “… a magnificent manuscript! I was totally captured... the very human reaction to everything makes this document truly special… I read, and often reread, every word.” -- Mary Grey James, Parnassus Books, Nashville, TN “... many times made me laugh out loud. Not one to resort to melodrama for impact, Minda speaks with a refreshing honesty and clarity that leaves the reader wanting to know more...” -- Becca Ingle, RN, Hematology Nurse Practitioner ""... both entertaining and inspiring as she shares the wisdom and insights gained from over 40 years of navigating the U.S. health care system... a must read for individuals living with chronic or life-threatening illness and their caregivers. Health care providers will also appreciate this enlightened perspective that encourages patients’ proactive collaboration in health care decision-making."" -- Melissa M. Hudson, M.D., Cancer Survivorship Division, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital At age 15, Minda became Patient 2410 at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital when she was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s – a disease of the lymph nodes. The “C word” was never spoken that day in 1970. This diagnosis, however, was the first of many as cancer and other illnesses made a full-body assault on Minda for the next 40 years.  From 1970 to 2011, Minda endured 10 major surgeries, 5 battles with cancer and 2 brain tumors.  After Minda passed away, Christine Kreyling and Liz Garrigan of the Nashville Scene wrote, ""Over the course of her life, she battled Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, a brain tumor and Epstein-Barr syndrome, though she did so with an uncommon grace that inspired her family and friends."" Not only did Minda survive these battles, she thrived and lived to the fullest. In the 40 years she fought for her life, she also served as a member of the U.S. Committee for UNICEF, testified before Congress in the hearings on the Better Nutrition and Health for Children Act, became the director of a Vanderbilt University nonprofit supporting mother and infant health in low income communities and sparked the battle to conserve the rural community where she lived for more than two decades. Through all of this, Minda somehow managed to weave a daily practice of meditation and being in the outdoors into her life.  Robert Brandt, a founding board member of the Land Trust for Tennessee was quoted saying, ""If there was anything she couldn't do, I'm not aware of it. She was a visionary leader and superb organizer. She was a devoted mother and spouse. She was a great cook and a talented, creative seamstress. She could name all the trees and wildflowers in the woods and the birds in the air. She was a gifted writer as well."" In 1979, at the age of 24, my mom was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma for a second time. She had taken up weaving, and in 1980, she created ""Woven Cancer"". The print on archival paper is an illustrated reproduction I created of the weaving. The canvas tote bag also has the reproduction of ""Woven Cancer"". This will give you an idea of what it might look like.  In 2009, my mom was diagnosed with cancer for the fifth time. The illness began to take hold while we were traveling in Italy. Minda mostly stayed in bed, but she wanted to make it through the trip. Part of the trip was to a beautiful island off the coast of Tuscany called Elba where Napoleon  was exiled in the 1800s. These were days of reprieve for her and became the inspiration for the title song of my father's album, Isle of Elba. Both the album and the book cover feature a picture from that stay on Elba. The majority of the money, about $4500, will go towards the publishing costs. This includes final editing, formatting and the creation of an e-book.  The remainder will go towards printing copies of the book and all the wonderful rewards! Our hope is that we can also take Whatever Happened to Patient 2410 beyond family and friends and reach a wider audience of readers online and in bookstores across the US. ",92.27950310559007,865,44,2.476166666666667,30.0,8,4,2014,1,1,18,mixed,4,0,3,0,0.004624277456647399,0.0,0.464163133454472,15.582364750447388,0.0,kickstarter

While I am admittedly a warm-blooded American male, the news of this Oscar-winning actress--and arguably one of the most beautiful people in the world--voluntarily undergoing a serious procedure to remove both of her breasts didn't interest me for that reason.  Rather, at that time in 2012 I was working as a software engineer for one of the world's leading cancer laboratories.  Myriad Genetics (MYGN), located in the foothills of the Wasatch mountain range in Salt Lake City, performs an expensive genetic test to examine human DNA for a specific genetic mutation.  This mutation, called BRCA1 can, when present, indicate that a woman is up to 7 times more likely to develop breast cancer during her lifetime than a woman without the mutation.  I was sure that Ms. Jolie had made her dramatic decision based on the results of one of these Myriad Genetics tests, and for that reason she had my attention. I  sat on the end of my bed to watch the rest of the story.  A cancer expert appeared and began to explain how serious this hereditary risk is to women, explaining that thousands of women could benefit from knowing and understanding their individual genetic risk for breast cancer.  In a natural follow-up question to this comment, the news anchor then asked, ""How can a woman watching this program learn if they have this elevated hereditary risk without undergoing the same expensive genetic test as Angelina Jolie?”  The expert's answer to this question is the reason I have started this project on Kickstarter: ""There isn't an easy way for a women to find out her risk right now without visiting her physician and undergoing genetic testing,"" she said.   I thought about her answer as I finished getting ready for work that Thursday morning and as I drove the 35 miles along I-15 from my suburban home outside of Salt Lake to the Myriad Genetics Labs.   I have thought about it a lot since then, too. Here are some stark facts about breast cancer, as reported on breastcancer.org: There are well-known risk factors that play into a person's hereditary cancer profile.  I no longer work for Myriad Genetics, but my experience working there  and the amount of personal time I've spent on the subject have helped me understand what those risk factors are.  I’ve collected data from the National Institute of Health and the American Cancer Society and I’ve spent time learning how to use some open source software algorithms from renowned scientists in this field from institutions like Boston General Hospital and Harvard University.  The hereditary risk factors for breast cancer are not secret, and all this data is available if you take the time and know where to look.   So now I want to put this information and my unique qualifications to use by building a mobile, web, and social platform that any woman--not just those with pockets like Angelina Jolie--can access FREE OF CHARGE to learn what hereditary ""red flags"" they have in their family tree.  Here's how this software will work (Forgive me. This gets a little nerdy and technical but it’s worth it). 1.  I will build a safe and secure software platform, including a very nice website and mobile app, to help gather an individual's family health history.  The web and mobile tools will be super-simple to use and will guide the user through the process of gathering her relevant health information.  To get an idea of what I’m talking about you can check out the link below.  About 10 years ago the Department of the Surgeon General built a tool to collect family health history  (https://familyhistory.hhs.gov/fhh-web/home.action).  Unfortunately, this tool is outdated, hard to use, and very isolated.  My tool will be very modern and clean, use current and relevant technology, and produce an outcome that will be relevant, applicable, and portable. To help with the process of gathering family health history, the tools will integrate with third party genealogy tools and sites.  My goal is to integrate with Ancestry.com (I don’t have any agreement in place with them at this time), FamilySearch.org, the Surgeon General’s Family Health Portrait tool, and other medical systems that exchange data using the globally accepted HL7 family history data format so that the information generated from my tool will be able to be imported and used by many other existing health care technology.  Hey, I warned you it would get nerdy! 2. Once family health history has been gathered, the software will run it through a set of rules and statistical models looking for red flags.  We will examine criteria from both the individual as well as patterns from their family.  For example, Myriad Genetics suggests that that red flags are present in your family if any of these criteria are present: The User The User's Family This portion of the report will look something like the following: These criteria, along with many other criteria, will be used by the tool. An example of a tool that generates red flags for breast cancer is the Hereditary Cancer Quiz put out by Myriad Genetics and is found here: https://www.hereditarycancerquiz.com.  My tool will be an improvement because it will collect a user's family history specifics and produce a more specific and individually-tailored and accurate report that the user can then take to her healthcare provider.   3. The tool will then produce an easy-to-understand report that will list all of the red flags that were detected by the system, together with specifics from the user’s  health history that triggered the red flag.   It’s very important to note that we will not make any kind of medical recommendations. That is the role of a doctor or trained medical professional.  But each red flag will contain links to information about itself from trusted online sources and we will provide a way for an individual to locate physicians nearby if they wish to have their results reviewed by a healthcare provider. 4. The system will provide a way to securely share the results with family members and friends.   This tool and the report it generates will empower women with information about their inherited health and help them take the next step toward prevention and ultimately a healthy future.  My hope is that it will be the first simple step toward saving lives. Your support will help me turn this vision into a reality.  The raised funds will be used to develop the software and purchase the hardware needed to run the system. October is National Breast Cancer Awareness month.   If you have thought about donating to the cause please consider contributing to my project.  I am tired of sitting on the sideline wondering if there is something I can do in the fight against cancer.  Together we can make a difference.

Your support is directly helping us to afford the research and production of the following books in the series and to give back: On Oct 6th at 8:34am we crossed the barrier for our ultimate goal of  $12,000, allowing us to donate 110 books to Latinas Contra Cancer and making them available for free to families in need. This has been the most exhilarating 30 days in my life yet, the making of dream come true, and YOU my backers have made it all possible. Thank you, un millón de gracias! from the bottom of my heart. - Alan =============== For many years I have had this dream of using my illustration skills to tell a story that would bring something positive into the world A couple years ago, I was catching up with my dear friend Ysabel Duron who is a cancer survivor and who runs the non-profit agency Latinas Contra Cancer.She shared with me how in the topic of childhood cancer there are only a few children's books that have been translated into Spanish.  Together, we envisioned a bilingual children's book that could:  This way, our project was born and we began the research: I had the life-changing experience of interviewing a group of Spanish speaking families with children that were undergoing treatment.These families embraced me as one of their own, they guided me to interview their doctors, nurses, social workers and child life specialists. After 9 months of hard work the manuscript was complete, and it was now time to develop the illustrations. So I started taking classes and interviewing professionals in the industry with the goal of creating beautiful character and scenarios that would make justice to the profound testimonials from all these families and medical professionals. As of today, I have all the illustrations in pencil and am in the final stages of coloring them. And with your help we will make Benito, You Can Do It! a full color, 80 page (40 in English and 40 in Spanish) children's book that will bring strength and hope to families in need.

""Remember to still be there a few months after the diagnosis, when it's not so new anymore. The fanfare will have died down, but your friend will still be struggling and needing logistical and emotional help."" ~ Elana Miller, MD THE INSPIRATION I remember the times my mother smiled and laughed while she was battling Cancer. They were always when she received a card in the mail from a dear friend or they came to visit with card in hand. When she had to be hospitalized weeks at a time, we were told not to bring flowers on her floor due to Cancer patients immune system. Once again, I noticed the joy and happiness everyone on the floor received when the mail was delivered to their rooms and they opened that card and read those words of support and love.  My mother kept every one of those cards and sometimes I would walk into her room and she would be asleep with a card lying on her chest. I realized then that words carry power and can bring laughter and joy to people who sometimes struggle to get through the day. My mother may have physically missed special moments in all of her children’s life, such as weddings and the birth of her grandchildren, but her sense of style, humor and laughter lives on in our Warrior Cancer Cards. THE CARDS CENSORED: This group of cards will not have any bad words that you weren’t allowed to say as a child. UNCENSORED: This group of cards will have it ALL. The GOOD, the BAD and everything in between. LITTLE WARRIORS: This group of cards will be bring joy and hope to every child that receives them. Drool over the entire line HERE.

Entourée de mes proches, j'ai mené un combat pour ne pas céder à la peur et pour garder le sourire sur la vie.  De cette période est née l'idée de sénovie, dont l'objectif est simple : Transformer l'épreuve de la maladie en une initiative utile pour les femmes traversant un parcours médical similaire ... Leur amener ce que j'ai ressenti comme un besoin fondamental au moment des traitements : confort, protection et féminité.  C'est ma pierre à l'édifice. Par cette campagne de financement participatif, je vous propose de m'aider à sceller cette pierre par la création de sénovie, afin de construire ensemble une chaîne humaine qui soutienne les patientes.   Créer et commercialiser une gamme de vêtements et sous-vêtements destinés aux femmes atteintes d’un cancer du sein. Les contraintes corporelles liées aux traitements sont identifiées et résolues techniquement grâce au travail réalisé par notre équipe créa, constituée par notre styliste, une couturière bénévole et moi-même.  En parallèle je soumets régulièrement nos idées et réalisations à des patientes et anciennes patientes, afin d'être au plus près des besoins de chacune, recueillant également leurs suggestions.     Nous avons pensé et conçu une collection associant confort, protection et féminité.  Cette démarche est notre réponse aux problématiques induites par les traitements, au niveau de la peau et des serrages corporels ; elle vise également à réduire l'atteinte de la féminité qu'occasionne le cancer du sein.  Techniquement, nous proposons :   Nous utiliserons pour nos produits des matières naturelles de qualité :   Nous travaillerons exclusivement avec des fabricants et des ateliers français, dans la Région Occitanie, proche de Toulouse.     Nous avons étudié un plan de collection complet mis au point avec des femmes ayant été touchées par un cancer du sein : de nombreuses réunions nous ont permis d'affiner la demande afin de développer des produits adaptés à toutes. Nous poursuivrons cette démarche dans le temps ... au plus près de leurs besoins. Dans une démarche de recherche, nous avons réalisé les prototypes de certains vêtements de la collection, visibles sur la vidéo de présentation.  Au même titre que les vêtements, les sous-vêtements et le maillot ont été réfléchis pour éviter l'abrasion et les serrages, mais également pour accueillir une prothèse si besoin. Le prototypage et la finalisation, plus technique que pour les vêtements, se fera avec les fonds récoltés. Une styliste spécialisée en lingerie, déjà choisie par notre équipe, nous aidera à mettre en oeuvre nos idées.      Les fonds collectés grâce à vous nous permettront, dans un premier temps, de lancer la fabrication des trois premières pièces à savoir un pantalon, une robe et un chemisier. Nous serons également en mesure de les proposer sur une plateforme de vente en ligne afin que les patientes puissent les commander directement de chez elles.

With over 5 million suffering from Alzheimer's in the United States and millions more worldwide suffering the effects of Cancer, I know there has to be many more caregivers as frustrated  as I am trying to figure out something to keep their loved ones stimulated, occupied and in touch with the rest of their family and friends. Another issue is that I noticed friends stopped sending Marie cards, mistakenly thinking she would no longer read or appreciate them but that is absolutely not the case! Everyday the mailman comes to our door and Marie will first ask, ""Who was that?"" When I tell her it was the mailman, she will ask, ""Did he bring me anything?"" When she does get something, it makes her day!  So I would like help Marie send out 50 cards to friends, family and other Alzheimer's fighters we have met. The back of each card will give a short summery of Marie's goal to brighten the day of someone fighting for thier lives and encourage them to send out two cards, one to Marie and one to someone else they know is suffering from Alzheimer's or Cancer. I need to raise the funds to buy the postage needed to send them out. If all goes well we will keep doing it as long as she is able. If you would simply like to mail Marie a card, please do.

First Assistant Director Kira Howe How will your backing help
One of the things you may be curious about and wanting to know is what we plan to do with the funds raised with your help. Since we are now 4 filming days away from completing principal production on ""Always Live Laugh Love""  we need to turn the post-production of the film over to a very talented Editor who will take all the work we created over 4 months of filming in to the film we really want share with you by piecing the story and every scene we've filmed together. That's why we need your help, since this is all the stages of post production we won't be able to complete without having backers to help us get there.     Hiring the film Editor is the first thing or expense we are going to encounter.  Even though we have a very talented Editor lined up and ready to work on our film, he is one of the crew members who we will be paying up-front. You may be wondering why is it that everyone else worked for free and he editor won't; well we may be able to get an editor to edit this film for free but know for sure he won't have the skills and knowledge needed to deliver a final product we would be happy sharing with you. The other main factor we had to consider when we decided to pay the editor is the fact that he will be spending 8 to 12 hours a day for a period of 2 to 3 months, as he works on the film 5 to 6 days a week to get it completed. Editing is where films are made or destroyed and with your help ours will be made right.     The second thing we need funding for is be able to pay for the licensing agreement that comes to using music in films. The same way we wouldn't want someone to remake this film without the permission of our Writer we don't want to use someone's music without their consent and permission, for that to happen we will need to pay their licensing fee for the song we utilize.     The Third expense we will encounter is the fees that come when entering a film in to a Film Festival, since we know we have we are telling a great story with this film, we want to enter this film in some of the Major Festivals around the World to help everyone who worked on it to gain as much exposure as possible.     The last few things we will have to spend on are, posters, DVDs - Blu-Rays (Disk and Cases) for those who contribute to our film. Marketing for the film. Most of all we guarantee we will be making the donation promised below to the Moffit Cancer Center of Tampa Fl.

About a year into my chemotherapy I began to think of ways to help teens like myself. I came up with the idea of creating a mini-mag back in 2005, and now 8 years later I am finally ready to follow my dreams and create this magazine. Aloud. is a magazine that has articles about traditional teen topics like celebrity gossip, boys, and quizzes. In addition to those types of articles, there are articles about how to style wigs, young people who have been through traumatic health related diseases and ailments, tips for spicing up a bland hospital room and more. I wanted it to still be fun, but also have real issues teens who are in their situations can relate to. I chose the name Aloud. because I want these girls to think aloud, speak aloud, and live aloud. When you go through a traumatic event, oftentimes you want to hide yourself. This is certainly true in my own story. It is just now, 9 years later, that I am beginning to express myself as I used to when I was 14. I want to inspire these girls to live Aloud each day, in spite of all of the struggles they go through.   The reason I wanted to do a print magazine, that will also be available as a PDF download, is because whenever you're sick or disabled in someway, all you want is to feel normal. To me, a teen magazine is about as normal as it gets. Printing costs is where the majority of the money will go. Printing magazines in small quantities means the price per copy is higher. I plan on printing 250-500 copies for the first run, and gauge how many copies are needed above that.

Sometimes, to be frank, they're just-in-case pictures. Often, it's to document with love all the extra time we're getting to spend together - a side-effect of the malady. But taking pictures of him, or having pictures of him, even in this difficult and often dark time, is always because I love him.  When my brother stopped letting me take his picture, I acquiesced. Ultimately though, I had an inspiration. What if... ...a bald head, for a moment, isn't yet another reminder of the Big C. What if... it's a costume piece, a lucky beginning to indulging in cosplay, a chance to play dress-up, a welcome escape into fantasy. What if it's fun? My brother and I are doing a photography series project where he portrays some of the most famous bald characters in cinematic and television history. We're doing this... * to raise cancer awareness (don't know if you've heard, but cancer really sucks)* to have a lot of fun with a bald head* to restart a professional life for myself and for my brother after his cancer ripped the rug out from under us both* to practice for and plan a life offering character photo shoots to many others battling likewise* to build a portfolio to present to people and organizations who can sponsor the above* to inspire everyone who's bald but doesn't want to be to enjoy it as much as possible The product of this project will be twelve images published in a calendar. We'd like to do a total of twenty-four, enough for a second calendar, but right now we need sponsorship to complete the first twelve. From there, we'll seek corporate sponsorship to provide the calendar free to clinics and wards, and hope to offer it for sale as well. As you can imagine, long term illness takes a chunk out of everyone's wallet. Or all of it. We need makeup, props, costumes, and a few additional photography equipment items. Mostly we've been working with what we have, aside from a wonderful sponsorship from our grandmother, which financed Bane's coat and mask.  So far we've shot six: Bane, Walter White, Kojak, Lex Luthor, Homer Simpson, and Elmer Fudd. We can't move forward without additional sponsorship. And we'd really like to - this project has been a giant bright spot in a very hard year.

The Mighty Titan is a character who is for all intents and purposes, invulnerable. He cannot be harmed by any means known to man. His alter ego doesn't have such luck. Titan's alter ego is dying of cancer.  What now? Isn't this the perception that we all have when not touched by cancer? We are all under the belief that we are invulnerable. Aren't we all someone's protector? Aren't we all everything to someone? Not until that lump, or pain, or (un)lucky scan. How we deal with this defines us. How we live with this strengthens us. What we lose is innocence and the loss of a clear mind. This is my epitaph. This is my way of dealing. This is my way of helping others understand what it feels like to be invulnerable... And then, one conversation, one sentence later... never feeling that way again. ""I am sorry, Mr. Martino. You have adeno cell carcinoma."" were the last words my 33 year old innocent, clear-minded self ever heard. From that day forward, I had cancer. Life was over.

Overnight, my entire life completely changed.  One morning, I was a college football player.  The next morning, I was in a dark and unfamiliar place that I could have never prepared for - I was living the life of a cancer patient.  My first round of chemotherapy was one of the hardest things that I had ever endured.  I felt that there had to be a way to make chemotherapy even the slightest bit more comfortable.  I immediately wanted to create something that would alleviate some of the pain and discomfort that I experienced, and make sure others wouldn't have to feel the way I did.  When you are diagnosed with cancer, many of life's comforts, and much of your identity, are stripped from you. Simple things like being at ease, and the ability to dress like you normally would, can quickly become a distant luxury.  Just because a person is sick, it shouldn't mean they have to dress like a sick person. Not only does ComfPort allow you to keep an important part of your identity, but it provides the comfort of not having to remove your shirt while receiving chemotherapy.   The Port in ComfPort derives from the name of the device that is implanted in the chest of many cancer patients.  The Port is a disc shaped object that it is used for the delivery of chemotherapy, medication, blood transfusions, IV fluids, and many other medical tests.  One of the biggest benefits of the port is that it gives a central access point for treatments and saves a patient from receiving countless needle pokes in their veins.  While it saves from pain and discomfort in some ways, there are still many issues that a patient will encounter throughout their treatment...   The first time my port was accessed, I was immediately uncomfortable. We tried weaving the IV lines through different parts of my shirt, but it would still tug on the needle no matter what we tried. I was in constant pain from the needle being pulled from side to side in my chest. In the end, I decided to take my shirt off completely, but that left a number of other issues.  I instantly became cold, and had to cover up with several blankets, which also led to my IV lines being pulled.  It was a cycle of pain and discomfort that any cancer patient with a port can tell you about in detail.  Living with cancer was already uncomfortable enough and I knew that there had to be a better way.  There was a problem that needed to be fixed - this is where the idea for the Port-T began.  We wanted our Port-T to be perfect, so it has gone through many changes over the years.  Not only did we want to make a shirt that fixed an obvious problem for cancer patients, but we wanted to make a shirt that allowed a patient to dress like they would outside of the hospital setting.  It was a challenge to develop a shirt that was fashionable yet functional.  We tried several different pocket concepts, sizes, and placements, before ultimately arriving at the product you see today.  The pocket on our Port-T opens for cancer treatment access. Most importantly, it opens the possibility of bringing cancer patients everywhere added comfort during an extremely uncomfortable time.   If you would like more information on the port and its purpose, take a look at this article: http://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-treated/chemotherapy/catheters-and-ports-cancer-treatment When creating ComfPort we made it our mission to provide Port-T's to as many cancer patients as possible. We didn't want a lack of resources or knowledge of our shirts to prevent an individual from having the comfort they deserve. That is why we developed the supPort-T and have decided to be a one-for-one company.  That means for every port shirt we sell, Port-T or supPort-T, one will be going to a patient in need on your behalf.  The supPort-T is designed to be much more than another t-shirt.  It will look and feel great on you for sure, but it will also stand for something greater.  Your purchase will provide a Port-T to a person that needs one, and it will also show your unity and support in fighting cancer with them.  That is the reason all supPort-T's will look identical to Port-T's.  Cancer or no cancer, we will all wear our ComfPort shirts the same.  The only difference is the supPort-T's will not open for port access. Patient, family member, or friend... cancer takes away from us all.  As any cancer patient can tell you, sometimes it is those who love us the most that are actually going through the hardest fight. When you are diagnosed with cancer, you feel like much of life has been taken from you.  For me, the best way to fill that void has been to give back and make a difference in the lives of others. That is what we want to do with ComfPort - Make A Difference. We experimented with many fabrics during the development of our Port-T's and there was one fabric that stood above the rest. . . Bamboo!!! All of the Port and supPort-T's available as rewards through this Kickstarter are made from a Bamboo/Cotton/Spandex blend. Beyond style, bamboo offers many benefits that are especially appealing to cancer patients.  Here are a few of our favorites: For this campaign we will be offering 3 styles of Port and SupPort T's. . . The T, V, and Long Sleeve. We will offer shirt sizes XS-XXL (Women & Men's) and have 6 original color combinations.  You will be able to choose size and color after we are funded!

About the jewelry: All jewelry is made with Certified Swarovski Elements and Rhodium, 18k Gold, or Rose Gold over brass. No lead or nickel is used, so the jewelry is allergen free.  Overall Project Goals: 1) Design additional cancer awareness pieces that represent more of the less known cancers that affect millions everyday. 2) Donate a portion of the proceeds from sales of the cancer awareness necklaces to organizations doing research to find a cure cancer. 3) Obtain enough inventory to do jewelry ""shows"" at hospitals and donate a portion of the proceeds to their outreach and patient programs.  I have already done a jewelry show at a hospital in Houston and was able to donate over $1,000 to their volunteer program after only a day and a half show. With this success, I know that I could do so much more to help these non-profits with their outreach and with research to find cures.

Ill be creating approximately 20 jobs locally as we take Sassie Caps into the global marketplace. Sassie Caps are hats with micro-fiber synthetic hair sewn into them, specifically designed with cancer patients in mind. However they are great for anyone. They are much cooler than wearing a full wig and are light weight offering great protection from the elements. Sassie Caps come in a variety of colors and styles from the very basic to the elaborate. My goal here is to raise funding to finish the development of the Sassie Cap line, setup manufacturing and the web site so i can bring Sassie Caps to the global marketplace. It’s an addictive feeling to watch a smile and some confidence return to the face of a person that has had it taken away by cancer. Thank you for taking the time to look at my project today.

Not only does every woman in the world hope that every mammogram comes out Klean (clean) but through Klean Boobs we are also reminded to use products that are clean from anything that can potentially cause breast cancer. While using them it can even be a reminder to do your monthly self breast exam in the shower. I remember growing up my mom always talked about not using deodorant because of the harmful ingredients but that was in the early 90's, making natural products was unheard of for us. Now we live in a day in age where we have the power to choose products that are free of chemicals. Whether it's our deodorant, soap, shampoos, conditioners, make up...etc, we have the choice that we did not have years ago. Unfortunately my mom is not here to see her own daughter now has a vegan skincare line. In her honor, this initiative will allow us to donate 1000+ Klean Boobs Soaps to breast cancer survivors and warriors.  Help me spread the message of Klean Boobs with your pledge. Anything over the original pledge request we'll just make more soaps and donate them. Here are some of the amazing items that are connected with our rewards for your pledges. **Images of our Klean Boobs soaps are not available yet. It will be added in a follow up post. Klean Boobs are all natural vegan soaps made with Lavender essential oil and clay. Pictured above is our awareness soap ribbons.

It was brought to my attention that the women that had to remove their breast because of breast cancer seeing a boob soap may trigger sad memories.

For us this series is all about sharing and storytelling. It's always been our dream for people to take our bucket list adventures, whether they are as small as milking a cow and jumping off a bridge or as big as catching a touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers, and BE INSPIRED to go out and do it themselves. It's our hope that through this series we will be able to inspire others as Colleen, Gregory's late mother, was able to inspire all of us --giving back and celebrating the tremendous beauty of being alive.  We need to raise the funds to purchase the film and audio equipment required to be able to shoot the series at broadcast quality. Wisconsin Public Television and WNMU Public TV 13 among many other stations are on board to broadcast the series but we have to match their required film specs and resolution standards in order to broadcast it and without this equipment we can't.  We are so grateful for your support!       After an 8-year battle with cancer, Colleen past away at the age of 51. Following the funeral, her son, Gregory, and his three best friends decided to complete all of the items she left unfinished on her “dream board.” 

 “It was just sort of this moment in time where we all were very attuned to how short life is and we weren’t ready to just accept the standard track of life,” Gregory’s friend Kevin recalls. “Yes, there is something to be said for a great job, great kids, great house, etc. but what is the point of it all if you aren’t going out and being the best person you can be.” 

  A year later, as they started working on his Mom’s list -- Gregory, Kevin, Owen, and Nick a 2016 Kingsford High School Graduate decided to add their own dreams and ideas to it. 

“No idea was too far fetch or ridiculous for the list,” Owen explained. When all was said and done, it contained 273 of their biggest goals, wildest dreams, and deepest ambitions.  “People always talk; they talk about doing this,” Nick says “but no one actually does it.”

  “We are going to be hitting the state of Wisconsin where we have 14 huge items we are going after,” Gregory proudly announced. Accompanying them on this journey will be a camera crew filming an 8-part, Wisconsin travel/adventure series called Don’t Blink. The series will follow the four boys as they throw convention to the wind, chasing 14 of their biggest Wisconsin bucket list items and learning, for perhaps the first time, what it means to really truly live.

In a world filled with so much evil, violence, and fear, our nation is utterly silenced as it mourns the tragedies that continue to infiltrate our communities, safe havens, and schools--most recently, the elementary shooting in Newtown, CT which is literally ten minutes away from DAY's hometown of Danbury. And while most of today's rap music not only glorifies sex, drugs, and violent behavior but also subliminally misguides and confuses the youth of this generation, DAY's music (as it altogether abstains from explicit content, misogyny, and profanity) offers messages of hope, love, and empathy for the struggles of these trying times. But DAY's music isn't at all ""sugar-and-spice-and-everything's-nice!"" Having been called ""the Gospel Eminem"" and ""the Billy Graham of Hip Hop"", his music simultaneously impacts, uplifts, attracts, and convicts! As
a cancer survivor, DAY battled Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Enduring several
months of chemotherapy to rid his throat and chest of numerous golf-ball size
cancerous tumors, and at the same time having been hospitalized with pneumonia, DAY is the epitome of what it means to overcome. Hope and faith were the foundation of his miraculous recovery. It is his desire that his hope spreads contagiously! Never forgetting that seemingly-interminable time, DAY continues to make mention of his recovery at every show and in every interview as a testimony to inspire healing to the sick, strength to the broken, and restore hope to the hopeless. Therefore, the purpose of the concert is to not only introduce the official release of DAY's first full-length album Psalms of David but most importantly to touch hearts, change lives, and heal and inspire the soul through the powerful medium of music. ADMISSION FREE! The event will take place on Saturday, April 20, 2013, in Danbury, CT at Western Connecticut State University (Westside Campus) beginning at 6:00pm. Doors open at 5:00pm! The concert-style format of the show will feature VIP guest performers that will open the show. Two of the guest performers are currently featured on DAY's upcoming album Psalms of David. While Cross Movement Records recording artist K-Drama will hail all the way from Cincinnati, OH to rock the show, Chi-Town's very own Trent-G, ""fastest rapper in the world"" and crowned winner of Steve Harvey's Big Time TV Show is also set to blow you away!  DAY's ""set"" will include a live band, a DJ, special effects, and an overall amazing production that is sure to leave the crowd wanting more. DAY, who was recently featured in Birthplace Magazine and on SoJones.com, also graces the January 2013 cover of one of Hip Hop's most notable publications, HYPE Magazine. DAY will also be available after the conclusion of the concert for an exclusive CD-signing for all those who purchase the album.

E. Johnson? T. E. Johnson is the collaborative pen name of two unique artists. It is a combination of their names and styles, resulting in a just-anonymous-enough nom de plume.  What is Five for the Road? This is an adventure story that combines fantasy elements with personal experiences from both authors' lives. It was originally started as a writing exercise, but as more and more people showed interest in our little story, it grew to where we are today. And where, exactly, is that? We have drafted the first two books in this trilogy, with possible plans for further books and short stories written in this world. We plan on finishing up the third story this year, and wrapping up on editing all three to get them ready to pitch.  Who is this story for? This started out as a children's story, written for a narrow audience of the children in both authors' lives. But as the story progressed, each authors' natural personality bled into the story and gave it shape, darkening what was a simple adventure into something more of a mini-epic.  What are those personalities?  Well, Johnson being an Army veteran diagnosed with PTSD, some of those emotions surfaced and were put to use in the darker forces. You can't have a good story without a proper antagonist, and you can't have a hero without a villain.  T., on the other hand, has used personal experiences and travels in creating characters and places that you (almost) wish you could visit, and has decided to live vicariously through these characters for a while. Together they have worked on overcoming personal issues and have used this as a way to move beyond what has happened to them, focusing instead on creating something for others. So, is this a kids story or not? Well, that depends. The main characters range from 12 down to 3, but much of the events that take place are intended for a bit of an older audience.  We have been carefully editing the story, hoping to cross age boundaries, making this a story that can be shared, but it does include death, arson, evil monsters in the dark, different cultures, racism, among other possibly sensitive issues.  We have decided because of this to label it a 'Young Adult' or YA book. There is no other genre that seems to be able to cross boundaries both comfortable and non than this category.  Why do you need us? You might ask... And that is totally fair!  We are looking for backers who are looking for something new and unique to read, and who are willing to take a chance on a new story. For less than a new paperback, you can help us achieve a dream of seeing our book in (proof-copy) print.  If we actually get this going big enough, and stoke enough interest, we will try pitching the book to a publishing company. And only backers will have the original editions! The funds we raise will go toward editing, printing proof copies, cover design, and whatever else may arise in the name of a good story.  Will there be Stretch Goals? After reading quite a bit of differing opinions on this, we have agreed - yes! Stretch Goals are one of those things that I particularly like about a Kickstarter campaign, and is just another way to determine interest in a project.  So far we have kept our goal humble - just what we need to make this happen, but we also have plans for some cool artwork, new covers, additional short stories, and even an introduction by a famous author (as yet to be named)  as well as other goodies if this gets big enough!

Thank you for reading this, this is emotional for me to write this.   My name is Scott, 45 years old, and I am currently an owning partner in a small computer business in Upstate New York, rural Upstate New York. If you don't know the Cooperstown New York area, let me put it in perspective.  I had 31 students in my high school graduating class, yet with the Baseball Hall of Fame in our town we are one of America's biggest travel destinations.  This makes for an interesting opportunity that doesn't exist in very many places. You see, with such a small population the number of quality food options is extremely limited, and many (if not most) of the good food options are only open during the travel season.  If you look at Cooperstown on a map, we are geographically in the center of New York State.  With a mobile food trailer we can sell in our state capital of Albany, Syracuse, Binghamton and more!  To date there is only one food truck in our area, and I'm not entirely sure where it is setup, our area is starving for good local food.  But here is the interesting part... I was an executive chef for a number of years for a multi-million dollar restaurant until the owner sold, at which point I shifted my attention to the up and coming technology boom.  For the last 15 years I have worked in the I.T. field which has stripped me of my purpose and soul!  I work for paychecks and dollars, and I no longer want to do that.  I want to work for a greater cause, which is what I wish to name this food business ""Causes"".  See, my Mother is now battling cancer for the 3rd time.  She is a Registered Nurse and she too spent many years working for organizations such as Hospice.  Hospice doesn't pay much at all, but it fed her soul, she could make a difference in somebody's life... and I wish to honor her by doing the same.. Now just another food truck is likely not a worthy investment, food trucks and trailers are everywhere!  But here is what makes this one different.  We will setup to vend at good & loving organizations such as Walk-for-Life Relays, SPCA (I'm a huge animal lover), Veteran Organizations and at the end of each day we will hand the organization a check for 15% of our profits!!  I don't wish to get rich with dollars, I wish to get rich in good deeds and Thank You's.  Please help me realize this goal, please be a part of something special, an uncomplicated, quality organization that can grow by serving good local food and giving profits to those that need it most.  When we have achieved our certain success, we will help set this up in another town.  The world needs more simple help from good people.  As partner in my current company I intend to give up my position in trade for services such as a new web site and social media management for Causes.  All the proverbial nuts & bolts required for marketing, accounting, etc will be payed for as a donation from current business. What I am unable to do out of pocket is pay for the trailer and equipment as I have my first baby due on New Years Eve.  We are fortunate enough to have a food trailer manufacturer just 40 minutes away.  Their top of the line food trailer sells for $19,500!!  Leaving $5,500 for a pellet smoker, utensils and the initial couple of shopping trips to get this started.  I would like to reach out to those of you have the money to invest in good karma, please feel free to be involved as much or as little as you'd like, it matters to me that you good people that invest understand that this business is not for me, it is not for my family, this is for those that can use the help.  I have many charity fingers coming off of this project that the food trailer will fund.  If I can make $1,500/month then I am happy HAPPY!  This is for all of those wonderful humans that make the world go round. I have family that participate and sell their goods at local food markets.  We will be establishing trade relationships with those vendors and feature their ingredients in our seasonal dishes further promoting local business and farming.  We also have a regional hospital here that is one of the areas biggest employers.  The employees of this hospital are clamoring for good food, as previously mentioned most places close or don't deliver during the busy season.  This is guaranteed income for the business during the slow months. Together we can do great things, please join me and THANK YOU!!",0.0,828,42,0.0,60.0,12,5,2017,1,1,24,general,1,0,1,0,0.0012077294685990338,0.0,0.35530474040632054,1.9922255589078908,0.0,kickstarter

First stop was produce.
She would get green peppers, onions, cilantro and quite a few other vegetables and herbs to make her sofrito.
My mother was the oldest daughter and third oldest of ten siblings. She had allot to do with the raising of the younger siblings. She grew up in Ponce Puerto Rico, the south side of the island. Her family, very poor. She learned at a very young age to cook utilizing local harvested ingredients as well as herbs from her mothers garden and had a passion for it.
Upon returning from the market, she would place all her vegetables and herbs on the kitchen table and start separating them.  I remember as if it was yesterday the essence of the aroma of the fresh herbs. The table covered, I could not see the tabletop.
You see, her sofrito was so award winning with friends and family, she would make bulk amounts to share it with everyone.
My mother  passed away a few years back and my father passed a couple of years after her. When my brother and I went to their home to clean it out, The first thing  I new I wanted to find was mama’s recipe box.  After reading some of her recipes i came across her ""SOFRITO"" recipe.  It was then that  after all these years of following what I thought was her recipe (she had three different recipes), I was missing a couple of key ingredients. So, I went to the market, bought all the things on her list (for all three different recipes). Came home, made the recipes and I was overwhelmed at the difference in taste. I now understand how she would use one of the three with different dishes she would prepare.
I have partnered up with one of New York’s finest executive chefs, Chef Jim Donahue, who is also my husband. Chef Jim was so impressed with my mother’s sofrito; we began to come up with recipes for other products, So you will have to stay tuned in.
We are committed to providing only the freshest product.

Fortunately I have friends/contacts who will help with the editing and graphic design for the book so those costs will be minimal. The novel is currently over half written. My original plan was to head to Dublin this fall/winter but an opportunity came up to go earlier. The good news is it will cost me less to go earlier, the bad news is I haven't raised the money yet to make the trip earlier a possibility. Never thought I'd be doing a Kickstarter but here I am.  Why this story? Moons ago, I married a wonderful girl who soon after our wedding was diagnosed with a treatable form of leukemia. She endured through chemo, a bone marrow transplant, and the day to day struggle that is fighting cancer. On the verge of being diagnosed as cured, she/we lost her sister, who had donated the marrow that saved her life.  I don't wish that experience on anyone. Our marriage didn't survive it, we barely survived it as individuals. From afar, grief is a term, a stage, or someone else's issue. Up close it changes everything. It can consume everything. But you can go on. This book is about the struggle to go on. Asking friends/family/strangers/you to help with this project isn't an easy thing to do. Part of me wants to write this book in a vacuum, release it, and see what happens. It feels too personal to go this route. But I didn't get through those tough years alone and it only makes sense that I write this book with the help of others.

I have to start by introducing Branka to the story. She had an unusual upbringing: born in Stockholm, Sweden on September 3rd, the same day the country changed driving on the right side of the road as Great Britain, and the streets where closed all day long while the entire country road signing was changed. Her parents were originally from Yugoslavia, now Serbia, and decided to move in the mid 70’s to South Eastern Venezuela when she was 7 years old. Even though being in a completely different country with another language and culture, it did not take her long to adapt to the place she would call home and love it as if she had been born there. It was late 2007 when we received her breast cancer diagnostic. The news was immensely difficult to handle. We had been married for only 3 years and had just started to plan to have a family. Seven years have now passed, full of endless trips to the hospital for chemotherapy, and several surgeries. We were faced with another disappointment when her illness metastasized to the bones, affecting her spine, ribs and sacrum. More chemo was on the way along with radiotherapy and a constant decay of her health and stamina. My desire was to support her in anything she would possibly need; I gave her all that was within my reach and means. But of most importance was as I declared on my wedding vows: I gave her all my love, as I have never loved anyone. We found ourselves planning a trip to visit her parents in Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela. There were high expectations, and we were excited with all the preparations. It had been a few years since the last time we went to visit, so we were looking forward to spending the holidays with the in-laws and I was going to go to Angel Falls, the tallest waterfall in the world, with my son, for a three day hike. Airline tickets where bought, with flight reservations made for Christmas Eve. We bought family gifts, and the bags where almost packed which was unusual for us; we always procrastinated about preparing our luggage before a trip. On December 21st, three days before the trip, Branka had a horrible seizure that landed us on the hospital where the tests revealed she had four tumors on the brain. Further tests revealed two more tumors for a total of six brain lesions.  Once again, we started the pilgrimage between doctors, hospitals and treatments, and an avalanche of new information to process. Needless to say, we had to cancel the trip to Venezuela and Christmas was not so merry after all. This was not what we were expecting. In fact, all December long was filled with sadness and worries, and with many sleepless and restless nights during the treatment for the brain tumors. But no matter how good all the medical attention she was having, it wasn’t enough. Her health was deteriorating day by day. More symptoms were appearing, she was hospitalized three more times until Wednesday, March 5th, when her oncologist informed us that she only had three more weeks to live. Her liver was completely invaded by cancer tumors, surgery was not an option and chemo was making her body weaker. My world crashed and broke apart; the love of my life was to be no more. I cried, but Branka was at peace. She had calmly accepted her outcome like she had known since the beginning she would depart in a near future. After the doctors left the room we hug, we kissed, and we cried together. We have always wanted our bodies to be cremated. Neither of us believed in funerals or cemeteries. That conversation took place when my mother died and her ashes where placed at the base of a tree dedicated in her name in a garden. I asked her if she would like her ashes to be in the same garden, to what she answered that she would like for me to place her on a beautiful place. The expression on her face let me know I had not proposed the right place, yet. I knew what she wanted, but as always, she did not wish to inconvenience me with the task at hand, so she had not expressed her true wishes. Knowing that her favorite place on Earth, called the Autana Tepuy (Flat-top Mountain), the one she loved so much she named her company after, I did offer to take her ashes to the Autana. Her expression changed in an instant and a glowing smile shined on her face. She liked the idea and it made her happy. So what is the Autana Tepuy? It is a 4000 feet high flat-top mountain worshiped by a local indigenous people of Venezuela called the Piaroa, and known as the tree of life: “Wahari-Kuawai”, where all the fruit of the world that feed humankind were created. The mountain is sacred and no native dares to go close. It was declared a protected national monument by the Venezuelan government in 1978. I did not have the slightest idea about the ordeal I got myself into when making that promise, and going through my grieving process, I started to do research on Autana. I knew it would not be an easy task, but did not expect it to be so difficult. Possible ways to get to the mountain were by land, requiring rock climbing, which I do not have any experience with, and hiring a local guide was not possible since they do not go close to the mountain. So, hiking there was out of the question. Another choice would be to hire a helicopter to take me from the nearest city and land on the top of the Tepuy, but being a protected natural monument means the Venezuelan government prohibits touching it. In fact, even attempting to try to get permits would be an impossible feat. So that leaves my last option: to fly by and scatter her ashes from a small plane. Ok, so now I have a plan.The next question is, when will I do it? It occurred me that the most adequate date will be on September 3rd, her birthday; I could not find a more appropriate or special moment to do this.",117.50757575757575,1102,54,1.0340666666666667,30.0,6,2,2014,1,1,27,breast cancer,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

We’re a group of Kindred spirits who crave beauty and the Cross of Jesus. We’ve seen firsthand how art and stories can come together to wildly encourage people. Encouragement sparks life. In Sincerely, Kindred, art and stories come together to extend encouragement, to say, “me too,” and to ignite the fire inside us that we were created to have. With an online presence and one print magazine, Issue Two has been three years in the making now. We want to invite those who believe in us to help us grow into the shoes we’ve been given. The world today is on fire. Movements are happening. The neglected are raising their voices and their picket signs. Wars are breaking out in offices and homes, on street corners and battlefields. Ours is a time of conviction, of pride, and of deliberation.  Let us introduce you to Sincerely, Kindred Issue 2 — Courage We believe that “Courage”  is a necessary and irreplaceable mantra for this time in the world. We want to capture this spirit, to raise our voices with the masses. And we need your help. The first issue of Sincerely, Kindred is dear to our hearts. We used a made-to-print website and each magazine cost $11 dollars for a 50-page publication. We had to print them as people ordered them. It was a good start, but this next issue is twice the size and twice the vision. 
Issue Two of Print will be: 104 Pages with High Quality Visuals + Articles + Letters8.5 x 11 in Size with a Heavier Matte Cover + Matte PagesPerfect Bound Spine holding together the work ofover 50 contributors from all over the U.S. and multiple countries
 We want to print in bulk to keep the cost lower because we truly believe that anyone can hold this magazine and be encouraged. It's full of real, raw, honest, and edifying thoughts and stories. We talk about forgiveness, cancer, Christians in non-Christian families, moving to new countries, BLM, human trafficking, #churchtoo, creating art, and interviews with two hugely successful Instagram influencers.  We need help to be generous toward others, everything costs money: shipping, packaging, merchandise costs, etc. If we reach our goal, we will have the funds to produce issue issues 2 at the quality and quantity it is due. Over 20 writers and artists contributed to this issue. The more successful our Kickstarter is, the more involved we can be in our current and future Kindred’s lives. We can continue to be a faithful online blog and we can invest in being able to be in someone’s home, on their coffee table available to encourage in a physical and tangible way. Fun Facts about Sincerely, Kindred:  1. Seven out of eight SK staff members worked on their university's publications together   2. The SK staff is spread across three different states and two different continents.  3. We still reach out to our favorite professors from college for help and advice. Thanks Dr. Romo + Jim! 4. Anyone can contribute to our blog, and over 100 different writers, photographers, and artists have contributed!  5. Due to geographical barriers, we hold staff meetings on Google Hangout. If we cannot hear someone during staff meeting, we tap the tops of our heads and slightly panic.  6. We pray for our readers and contributors!  7. We went from being a blog specifically for women to a blog for everyone! 
 8. Each one of our editors have full time jobs elsewhere and volunteer our time to edit produce wonderful content for you   9. From photos, to design, to restructuring sentences, we see every detail as a ministry.  10. Up until the start of this year, SK was run by only three people.

waiting in anxious anticipation for the Doctor to come in, hoping that what he
may say matches the hopes that we have been praying for, and… …well, “I have no good news for you.You have stage 4 cancer and it’s travelled
outside of your prostate into your bones.” I like Doctors that don’t beat around the bush or try to
sugar-coat the severity of any situation. On the other hand, my wife fell apart. It’s been a positive road since February-with strong support
from my wife, family, in-laws, friends, relatives, and customers-plus, I feel
that a higher power also has a major role in my recovery. My whole life has been a healthy one so this news came as a
complete surprise but my first reaction was to say, “Where do we go from here?”. So what’s the best way to get the word out and build a central
point of communication to help understand what a man has to go through and the
very painful testing that awaits him? Bringing
together anyone and everyone to participate and share their experiences, their
warnings, their healing process or their non-healing process, to help provide
those who have yet to experience what awaits them in the future, would be the
objective brought through an easy to use, interactive Wordpress site. Will
there be an interest or will men continue to ignore the probability of prostate
problems which eventually will lead to cancer? If
this project takes off I know I will have to bring more help on-board. And with
the help of many minds, who knows, it may take on a life of its own. Look what
Susan has done for helping women with breast cancer. If
it fizzles out, I still will continue to help friends and family understand the
challenges, mostly through my actions as they visibly see whether or not I am
still on the road to a positive recovery. Thank

KO stands for “KNOCKOUT” because we are KNOCKING OUT Breast Cancer! KO Breast Cancer is an organization designed to empower women: physically, mentally, and emotionally.  KO Breast Cancer was organized exclusively for charitable purposes. Specifically, to support the fighters, admire the survivors, while honoring the taken. We plan to use innovative strategies to build awareness and educate women (and men) that are unconscious to this horrific disease, while also assisting those who do not have access to quality breast health care. KO Breast Cancer plans to build awareness by having women, as well as men, pose similarly to the woman in Dana's painting; Standing strong, topless, and wearing nothing but pink boxing gloves to protect their bare breasts from this enemy, cancer. Why boxing gloves? Because it’s time to fight! Not only fight, but beat cancer. We’re talkin’ KNOCKOUT! What is the KNOCKOUT? The KNOCKOUT is a breast cancer photo shoot based in Chicago. We invite women and men to pose for the cause. All ethnicities, shapes, sizes, and individuals eighteen and over are welcome to participate. This event is open to the public.  We hire professional photographers to take the photos. There are experienced make-up artists and hair stylists on set for any models who would like to be glammed up for their shoot. Solo shots are available, along with group shots for those more comfortable posing with a loved one. In the past, we’ve had sisters pose together, mothers and daughters, friends, couples, pregnant women, and breast cancer survivors. These photos are tasteful, artistic, and empowering. Each picture captured is a reminder that together, we can defeat cancer.  Not only is the KNOCKOUT a photo shoot, but a celebration! A celebration of life! Throughout the day, there is healthy food, motivational music, live performances (poetry, song, dance, etc.), guest speakers, celebrity appearances, contests, raffles, and tables set up for purchasing a variety of merchandise. This is an event unlike any other! After the event, all the participants’ photos are added to a collage of Dana's original image, ""Fight Against Breast Cancer"". Each and every woman and man that poses for the cause will be included in KO’s collage of the woman in my painting. We plan to do these photo shoot events annually, and eventually in different states, so we can add more and more people to our collage of fighters. Our goal is for KO Breast Cancer to eventually be a name known nationwide. Individuals will pose for the cause from all over the country. The more fighters KO Breast Cancer has, the better our chances are for defeating this disease. And, the image that represents this organization will impact supporters now and for years to come.  KO Breast Cancer needs your help. This will be our 3rd annual KNOCKOUT event. We are confident about a successful turnout. We had over 200 people pose between our first and second event. The positive feedback we have received thus far is encouraging. Our goal is to double in size for our October 2014 event. We want to make this photo shoot a mind blowing, memorable experience for all.   We need funding to make this extraordinary event possible. We are raising donations to rent a spacious venue, hire professional photographers, and book live entertainment. We have to purchase decorations (lighting, linens, furniture, etc). We have to pay for catering to feed an average of 400-500 guests. We would like to be able to pass out giveaway KO Breast Cancer merchandise to those who participate in the photo shoot. We are also raising funding for promotional flyers, along with advertisement space in local magazines and on local radio stations. There’s so much to do to create a successful event! We need to spread the word and get as much support as possible in order to KNOCKOUT Breast Cancer across the country. Every dollar helps us get closer and closer to reaching our vision. With your financial support, KO Breast Cancer can gain the exposure needed to eventually expand and host bigger and better KNOCKOUT events. We appreciate your help!

They called an Uber and carried me home. ""Monotonous Material by @PommyT87!"" Bone Cancer Boys’ Home ""Business"" Plan! Cancer, in one of her rarer mutations, has chopped me down twice. I intend to be ""ready"" should she strike for a third time. Before I orate my “business"" plan, l shall catch you up with my cancerous slugfest. (To skip to the meat and bones, scroll down until you see the octopus again!) In the spring of 2009 I collapsed whilst enjoying a kick about (British colloquial for a casual football match) with friends in my home town. They dulled my pain with absinth and carried me home. After an X-Ray, an MRI, a specialist consultation and another X-Ray, I was diagnosed with having a Chondroblastoma in my left tibia.  This is an extraordinarily rare and normally ""benign"" (as any mutation can be), locally aggressive bone tumour caused by a small group of cancerous cells. The impossible pains that had haunted my every moving moment for many years, finally had a reason, or cause, for their unwelcome presence. In the summer of 2009 I underwent a Curettage Synthetic Bone Graft.  This cutting edge medical procedure sees a tumour, along with an eggshell of healthy surrounding cells removed, before the resulting cavity is flooded with a synthetic, concrete like substance.  Fortunately at the time I was attending university and so whilst this cancerous tackle left my social life in disarray for a few months, I was at least cocooned in the safety blanket of  student life and safe from the ""proper"" responsibilities & commitments of adult life. I recovered well and “passed” each of my follow-up scans for the next half-decade. My leg was strong enough for me to live and love a normal lifestyle again with no physical limitations and far less pain than I had endured prior.  In the fall of 2015 I collapsed whilst having a kick about with friends in London. They called an Uber and carried me home.  After an X-Ray, an MRI, a cat scan, another X-Ray, another MRI, a biopsy and a month spent sedated in a hospital bed, I was diagnosed with clear cell recurrent Chondrosarcoma, as another tumour happily gorged itself in the neighbourhood of the 2009 bone graft. The extent of damage caused, coupled with the severity of this particular cancerous mutation, saw me elevated to the care of a clinical field leading professor in the UK's leading specialist orthopaedic hospital. In the winter of 2015, six days short of my 28th birthday, I underwent a Massive Proximal Tibia Replacement; another cutting edge procedure and, in the sobriety of having Mortality step onto a distant horizon, the greatest birthday present I have received (and certainly the most expensive)!  I would now recommend that anyone of a queasy nature may benefit in skipping the coming sentences, however any sadists reading may delight in the words to come. A Massive Proximal Tibia Replacement sees the entire knee joint removed. The joint, the cap, the ligaments, the cartilage, the bone. A large part of my tibia (where the tumours loitered) was of course removed along with the bottom of the femur. A large mixed metal prosthetic was then inserted, with part of it drilled ""up"" the inside of my femur, and part of it drilled ""down"" the inside of my remaining tibia.  My quadriceps & calve muscles were then cut & pasted around this bionic construct in a way that could one day allow for some control over the creation! I now walk a fine line between evolved and created, a strange place for an outspoken anti-theist!  I recall my final request before succumbing to the general anaesthetic being for the Professor and his team to, if nothing else during my procedure, have fun. My first waking memory in the High Dependency Unit was of my professor’s right hand surgeon delighting over the “work of art” that had been performed on my once thunderous left peg. They had fun! I will be writing in far greater detail about my cancerous experiences on my blog in the future however for now, that's your fill. You can however, if impatient, watch my first micro film about cancer, here! In the wake of these unprovoked attacks of cell mutation, I want to have a plan ready should I be taken down for a ""third time unlucky"". At the time of my second collapse I was an employee of a firm with a strong wellness policy that continued to pay my salary despite my comatose state (something derived of EU policy for any ""VoteLeave"" Brits who've read this far). Whilst fortune may favour the brave, disaster stalks the unprepared, and should cancer rally itself for a third strike, I may not be sitting so comfortably at the time. And so I intend to cultivate a part-time micro business to provide a financial safety net should I be felled again! That business already has a name. ""Monotonous Material by @PommyT87""! An online multimedia gallery! The title, ""Monotonous Material"", is a tongue in cheek swipe at the increasingly repetitive and unvarying  nature of material found online. As an Elder Millennial I have grown up with social media and so remember when Facebook required an academic email address, YouTube did not provide a career prospect and Twitter was still the alternate form of news source. That has of course, all changed and as the financial viability of online business has been proven, stereotypes have been born. From the Facebook health ""guru"", endlessly plugging their juice product whilst dodging questioning on their qualification as a dietician, to the YouTube ""reactor"", re-uploading content created by others but with the addition of minute opinion from themselves, and of course,  The Instagram ""Personal Trainer"", filtered until dilute, with a training package eternally on sale. Originality is in the eyes of the Beholder as much as it is the Creator, however whilst I will fall victim to certain occasional online mundanities, I hope to at least steer towards a unique product as best I can. I have taken the handle @PommyT87 across all relevant social medias, and intend to make this not only the signature on my artwork, but a way of my being located quickly and easily across the web. A naked view of my intended business plan is stark and lean. I create traditional, original artwork and I then flog it online! (I should point out here, that art, film making and content creation are all hobbies of mine, I am not planning to pick up a paint brush for the first time and expect success! I studied Fine Art & Photography until 18 at which point they became ""just"" hobbies as I grew wary of being told what to create.) A fully clothed view however is slightly more layered. I turn the process of creation into a multimedia blog, utilising social media to advertise the work and to also, if successful, capitalise upon advertising revenues available on some forms of social media. The Online Art Market is currently valued around €1.57b... Monotonous Material will, in short, become a cross platform gallery, providing original artwork, film and writing along with occasional opinion on current affairs and events.  Beginning with the likes of Instagram and DeviantArt, I will share regular photographic updates of each piece of art I create, from conception through production and on to publication. With some simple application linking, these updates will automatically be shared to the likes of Facebook, Twitter and many more social media plateaus, reaching into each corner of the world wide web. I will also be capturing the entire process on video and publishing the resulting films to YouTube, Vimeo and Daily Motion. Finally, a blog such as this will reflect upon the ideology and influences behind each piece before it is made available to buy on either Etsy! You can watch an early attempt of mine at creating a film out of art here. I have a way to go but this is all, before anything else, a hobby to master and is enjoyed rather than endured! My initial funding goal reflects an aim to increase the quality of my current product so that it may become of a suitable standard to sell. I want to migrate from felt tips on white paper to Copic Markers on stretched canvas. I want to migrate from filming with a GoPro to filming with an SLR. I want to work from an tilting artists' desk rather than from a decorative hallway desk. I could go on, but the theme should be clear. I want to make Monotonous Material perform as a ""professional hobby"". High quality original content, forming a unique online gallery across the internet.  It feels foolish, ignorant and certainly arrogant, as someone twice cut down by cancer, to consider the long term future however to do so is a necessary part of recovery, or at least, an amusing petulance in the face of adversity. If I live long enough and have any sort of success in creating and selling art work then my end goal is to create a working studio in London. Open as a gallery exclusively to sponsors, donators, and buyers, the studio will make use of one of London’s many vacant small scale units and will act as a physical base for an otherwise online enterprise. The studio itself, must of course be a work of art!  I would like to contribute to society rather than benefit from it and I feel a debt of gratitude to secular science, modern medicine, the British Government and of course our social healthcare system, the NHS. I have sold my own artwork for profit as far back as year 10 (ages 14-15) and began paying tax when working as a window cleaner at 16.

The story, which will combine animation with footage I shot of Jonathan during his year and a half battle with leukemia, will be told through the eyes of his alter ego, a rockstar named “Johnny Physical.” I’m a writer, magazine editor and first-time filmmaker based in Los Angeles.  BACKGROUND Jonathan and I grew up in Paramus, NJ, a suburb of New York City. When our mom gave him a Buddy Holly tape in the mid-1980s, his life changed. He listened to that tape over and over and pretty soon music became his thing. He started playing the piano, drums and guitar and dreaming of becoming a rock star. He decided to start a band called “The Physicals” and started calling himself “Johnny Physical.” When Jonathan arrived at Tufts University in 1998, life started imitating art. He found a guitarist, bassist and drummer and pretty soon “The Physicals” was the biggest sensation on campus. Johnny Physical was the sweet-talking, heartbreaker from the mean streets of New York who was everything that Jonathan wasn’t.  At the beginning of his junior year at Tufts University, Jonathan was diagnosed with leukemia. When he left college in the Fall of 2000 to begin cancer treatment, it seemed like his rock n’ roll dreams were shattered. But, two weeks into chemotherapy, when his blood counts were perilously low and he was at his most vulnerable, he decided to perform a concert in the hospital day room. Watching Jonathan revel in Johnny Physical was the most moving experience of my life. It was the day I first started looking up to him. After the concert, I told him that we should create a film about Johnny Physical. He loved the idea and we decided to title it JOHNNY PHYSICAL LIVES, after the album that first made him fall in love with rock n’ roll, BUDDY HOLLY LIVES.  THE FILM JOHNNY PHYSICAL LIVES combines the archival material I shot of Jonathan battling cancer with animation to “physically” bring to life Jonathan’s inner world. Through animation, I will communicate what video simply cannot—how Jonathan experienced cancer through the eyes of a rock star. WHY THIS FILM MATTERS: YOUNG ADULTS AND CANCER In the un-animated universe, nothing about cancer feels very rock n’ roll. In the U.S. alone, more than 70,000 young adults are diagnosed with the disease each year. While overall survival rates have improved during the past 25 years, for those between the ages of 15 and 29, survival rates have worsened. In addition, young adults with cancer face their own distinct set of emotional challenges, finding themselves utterly dependent at a time in their lives when they’re supposed to be asserting their independence. HOW YOU CAN HELP Please help me shine a light on this under-served demographic--young adults touched by cancer--by donating funds for the remaining production (animation, sound design, color correction, editing) and distribution costs (outreach, packaging, legal) of JOHNNY PHYSICAL LIVES, a story about courage, imagination, and one very special person, who—more than anything else—had rock n’ roll in his blood.

Inspired by Lance Armstrong winning the Tour de France as a cancer survivor (we have the same oncologist, Dr. Craig Nichols, who convinced Lance Armstrong to start the LiveStrong Foundation), I started composing new music, started a jazz fusion band, started booking gigs, developed a fan base, and started working towards making my dreams a reality. My next goal is to record my first album so that more people can hear the music I've been writing. I've written more than enough material. However, I don't have the financial means to fund the album production costs on my own. I'd like to raise funds to record my first album of my original jazz fusion instrumental compositions with my trio, the Melz, Prigodich, Erskine Group (MPEG) consisting of me (Mike Prigodich) on piano and keyboards, world-class bass virtuoso Damian Erskine, world-class drummer extraordinaire Reinhardt Melz, as well as various guest artists to be determined. I estimate the studio time, audio engineer, mixing, mastering, producer, and musician session rates will cost around $10,000 for this project. Any additional funds raised beyond the goal of $10,000 will go towards album duplication, artwork, publicity and promotion, and other album-related marketing and production costs.

My name is Cre Riggins and I am an aspiring singer/songwriter. I discovered at the tender age of 6 years old that I wanted to be an entertainer.  By the age of 19, I began writing my own songs.  All throughout my life, I've been explaining to my family and friends how much I wanted to be a singer. Most of the time, their response would be, ""Whats REALLY the chances of that happening, why don't you go into the medical field?""  I believe that question is asked because I'm from the small town of Biloxi, Mississippi.  I mean, who thinks of anything or anyone coming from the poor state of Mississippi? So, I've been discouraged and turned away from this dream for years.  Now, in order to push myself into it despite what my family said, I did return to school in 2013 and received my Bachelor's degree in Music Business from Full Sail University.  In November of 2016, I was diagnosed with Diffuse Large B Cell Non Hodgkins Lymphoma. I had just turned 29 and gave birth to my 2nd child.  All I could think of was...""great...i'm dying and now i'll never get to pursue my dream, my kids aren't going to know of anything great mommy did"" I thought my life was completely over.  To add to my list of unfortunate events, a month and a half before my diagnosis, my sister passed away after giving birth and guess what she left me? A THIRD BABY! So there I was, 29 years old with invasive cancer treatments starting, no job, and three kids to take care of.  I'm not going to lie, I fell deep into depression and didn't think I was going to be able to handle what had been placed before me. Luckily, I have a VERY supportive husband who stuck by my side and motivated me to get out of this dark place I was in and get ready for this fight.   I'm proud to say that I beat cancer right upside its ugly ass head!! I'M HERE and feeling like I have a second chance at life and I am going after any and everything I've always wanted! I refuse to spend the rest of my life letting others deter me from the path that was meant for ME! While i've been in remission, I have been writing and recording my first music project. It's a short project, an EP made up of 5 songs. These are all original songs written by me. I am wanting to raise this money to help me complete it. This includes, studio and recording cost, creating promotional items, creating video visuals, and covering legal costs (i.e copywriting/trademark fees) just to name a few.   I've attached a link to my SoundCloud page for you guys to click and enjoy some previous music that I've recorded in the past. I really hope you guys enjoy my music and I hope you can donate and help us create a super dope project! I look forward to meeting and communicating with all of you!

After my bilateral mastectomy different waves of emotion and pain took over my body leaving me feeling helpless, angry and alone. All my life, if anything was bothering me I always drew a picture to deal with it. Some people kick and scream, some people eat a vat of ice cream, I draw pictures; it’s my therapy. Some of them are pretty, some of them are scary but they got to the core of what I was feeling at the moment. I documented my emotional and physical pain, happiness, and hope through drawings and words, illustrating the good, the bad and the ugly sides of my journey. Your generous donations will make it possible for me to publish my book and share my story with the world.  Pablo Picasso once said “Art Washes Away The Dust of Everyday Life.” The drawings helped me express how I was feeling and helped me push through the pain. I hope to inspire others struggling with breast cancer, pain, sadness, or worry. I truly believe I was given breast cancer to help others. Now I want to share my art with the world. All of my suffering will be worthwhile If my book inspires other people who are struggling with pain, sadness, or worry. Whether they draw a picture, make a collage, or sing a song really loud I hope they will do something that helps take them to a happy place. To share my art with the world in hopes that it will inspire others struggling with cancer, pain, sadness, and worry. To travel across America sharing my book with others touched by cancer and inspire them to express their emotions through art. With your help I will be able to take my breast cancer journey on the road and share my story with other cancer survivors and patients. Your generous contributions will make it possible for me to print 1000  81/2in X 11”in 152+ page hardcover books. The book will be made from the pages of my very personal sketchbook/journal that I filled during my treatment and numerous surgeries for my breast cancer.The books will be presented at Cancer Centers in 8 US Cities as well as others along the wayOur fabulous rewards include a greeting card featuring one of my drawings from the ""Draw It Out - An Intimate Breast Cancer Journey"",  an 8 X 10 personally signed matte finished print of one of my drawings from the ""Draw It Out - An Intimate Breast Cancer Journey"" ,  a personally signed copy of my book, a  picture of you drawn by myself featured on the Sponsor Spread page in the center of the book with the other sponsors, a limited edition 11in x 14in, and a 24in x 36in limited edition photo print on canvas of one of five of my drawings from the book, and an exclusive intimate original 24in x 36in multi-media drawing on gallery wrapped canvas. I will speak to other cancer survivors and do a ""Draw It Out "" Workshops in each City. The workshops will help anyone dealing with cancer express their feelings through art. I will document every stop and do book signings at area Bookstores and Hospitals in between major stops. I am an artist and arts educator whose passion is exposing everyone to all forms of art. My journey as an artist started when I was born into my family’s folk singing group, The Bergerfolk. I spent my childhood touring across America and Europe, playing guitar, writing songs and performing with my family. In my journeys I was lucky enough to visit museums all over the world like The Stedelijk Museum of Modern Art and The Van Gogh Museum in Holland, The Louvre in Paris, The Galleria Comunale d’Arte Moderna e Contemporanea in Italy and The Museum of Modern Art in New York. I was amazed by paintings by Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Paul Cezanne, Pablo Picasso, Frida Kahlo and Johannes Vermeer, and sculptures by Claes Oldenburg, Constantin Brancusi, Auguste Rodin, and Marcel Duchamp. My early exposure to the arts gave me a deep understanding of art at a young age. With my family The Bergerfolk I recorded four records on Folkways/Smithsonian; Sing for Joy, Happy Landings, Sing of Sunshine and Rainbows, and Pack up Your Sorrows. At age five I realized while I loved singing folk songs with The Bergerfolk, what I really wanted to be was an artist just like Pablo Picasso. It was about this time when I started signing all my work with my last name just like the old masters did.  I embarked on my career as an artist at age 5 by selling caricatures at all the folk festivals and venues where we performed. My parents’ encouragement of my interest in art helped me become the artist that I am today. I plan to use my passion for art and my background in education to encourage others with cancer to express themselves. “All children are artists. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up” -Pablo Picasso I truly believe that that everyone has the ability to express themselves through art, explore materials and techniques, and interpret what they see. Educated at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, PA I received a bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts Sculpture. Later in my travels in the art world I decided to add a master’s degree in education specializing in Curriculum Design and Instruction and a Master's Degree in Business specializing in Organizational Psychology and Development which has helped me develop the principles to create great workshops and classes that serve my students with unforgettable moments of self expression and life through the arts.I am a founding member of Vox Populi, a cooperative art gallery in Philadelphia, and one of the founding members of the association that started First Friday in the United States.I have been exhibiting my work for over 25 years, and have written and illustrated three children’s books. After relocating from the East Coast to Las Vegas, I started an art program with art classes for  all ages from babies to seniors here in Las Vegas. After being diagnosed with breast cancer I developed an art therapy program for cancer patients of all ages. As an artist, I always use a creative approach to teaching art, with a perfect balance of structure and fun. My husband and I have three young children, all budding artists. Our children have learned to discover the Arts and express themselves through art in many ways much like ourselves. I want to thank you for your support in helping me achieve this goal! I truly believe I was sent on this journey with breast cancer to help others, and your contributions make that possible!  I promise to take this opportunity to share my story with America and inspire cancer patients along the way to express their feelings through art.

It does not contain actual scenes from the film.* Noah and Claire Hawthorne have different
approaches to facing the reality of their cancer-stricken daughter Kayla. While
Claire tries everything in her power to save Kayla, Noah accepts her fate and
instead obsesses over a do-it-yourself funeral. Their differences cause a
strain in their relationship. Will they be able to overcome the death of their
daughter and reconnect as a couple, or will their relationship be consigned to
the same fate as their daughter's? Like most student filmmakers, we rely heavily on the generosity of family and friends in order to make this film a reality. The total projected costs of making Twice Two Makes Four are $35,000. As of now, $15,000 has been secured, but we still need another $20,000 to prepare for shooting in March. This is where your financial support can help bring us closer to our goal. Besides the rewards, you will be supporting a group of passionate young filmmakers whose desire is to push the boundaries and create a unique and meaningful film. A journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. We will be eternally grateful for your help in providing us with the opportunity to make this step. As you may already know, making a film is awfully expensive! The projected costs of the additional $20,000 fall into a number of itemized categories, the largest of which include: 1) Camera rental (RED EPIC), 2) professional grip and lighting equipment, 3) actors’ fees, 4) production design, and 5) transportation to and from Pennsylvania and Arizona.  We are a group of

Cancer Dog features incredibly accessible themes (choice and narcisism), and an amazing line-up of talent both on and off stage.  

Normally when I finish creating a play, I gather interest from actors that I know in the valley, find a venue, and produce the work on my own.

I'm glad you asked.  Unlike a lot of theater companies in this town, I actually pay my actors.  I also pay for the venue, the set, the construction, and the advertisements.  The total production costs, when the smoke finally clears, for a full run can easily reach 50k or more.

Considering she had lost her mother from the same thing, I flew home the first chance I could.  In the following months I watched  my mom go through her treatments, and though they were tough and drained her energy, she still faced life with a positive attitude and laughter. She promised herself that when she was better she would start raising money for breast cancer research and awareness, and start running the Race for the Cure in Philadelphia every Mother's Day. While still recovering, my mom started Team Rosemary, named after her mother, and started planning, training, and raising money for the race in Philadelphia.  Through local events and bake sales, Team Rosemary has raised close to $10,000 in the past three years.  Every year, to publicize one of Team Rosemary's popular bake sales, my mom, Diane Chester, goes to one of South Jersey's local radio stations to talk about her battle with cancer, the loss of her mother, and how people can help support the fight against breast cancer.  This April Team Rosemary is venturing into a brand new area of fundraising.

From all of the profits made after it is distributed we are going to donate 10% to various cancer foundations.   Locations are a huge expense for 12 Days With God.

In addition to this the wardrobe needed to present a realistic medical environment will cost nearly a thousand dollars. And that is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg! Besides his spiritual and emotional transformation, the main character goes through a huge physical transformation. This is going to be done through practical effects that also requires a large financial investment. One of the things that we are doing with this movie is paying our actors and crew.

The Concept The ‘Red Dress’ is metaphoric of the veneer.  The version of ourselves that we unwittingly portray to the world.  It’s desirable, strong, beautiful and everybody admires it.  This veneer has been constructed by the very fabric of the societies in which we live.  The ideologies we grow up with, what’s acceptable, what’s not.  We all want to belong, to be accepted and so we feel we must be a certain way, and we fit in because it’s easier.  And at first it might feel like it really is.  So we cling to this veneer as if life depends upon it, and in so doing may feel the need to hide what’s going on underneath.  But what if life deals us an unexpected blow? Sickness. Accident. Abuse. War. Birth defects. We then bare the body-altering scars that not only make us look different, but perhaps make us see ourselves differently too. For those of us who find ourselves physically scarred by life’s events, we can easily slip into this idea that we are not beautiful at all. What is beauty anyway? Let’s redefine.  Goal - What Under the Red Dress aims to achieve How we aim to achieve it The objective of the ‘Under the Red Dress’ project is to build photo-narrative body of work by gathering contributors who have endured a journey resulting in grievous bodily scarring as a result of cancer.  They will tell real stories about real people.  In this way we hope to enable people to appreciate just what negative messages they are unwittingly accepting without filter or accountability and at the same time bring awareness to issues surrounding cancer and disease stigma.  The collective body of work will be published as a coffee table style book and we will also curate an exhibition.  Who we are Since the initial campaign featuring Beth's images went viral and made national and international headlines in Feb 2014, she has been addressing the media, promoting and working on the Under the Red Dress Project.  Beth has also been actively engaged in promoting cancer awareness and positive body image as an in-demand public speaker at various philanthropic events such as the David Jones Annual Mother's Day High Tea.  In addition, Beth is also using
 her advanced qualifications in Mental Health to screen our contributors
 and ensure those who share their stories in this project are in a good
 space and prepared to have a rewarding and safe experience. Read more about Beth in the 'about us' section.   During this time Nadia has also been working tirelessly screening, talking to potential contributors and creating new imagery for the project with those in our local area.  She has also produced and designed all the project paraphernalia and promotional material.  Nadia has a vivid passion for image making and coming from a background in fashion, beauty & advertising she really knows what goes into all the imagery you see in the media every day....she was making it herself! She now wants to lift the lid on that can of worms and show you just what you are seeing by letting you view a series of highly retouched and stylized 'Red Dress' images, next to the raw and truthful black and white portraits of our project contributors as they bear their scars. This is the Under the Red Dress Project platform.  Read more about Nadia in the 'about us' section.  Nadia & Beth have worked together to call, screen and choose a lineup of 50 volunteer contributors who bear the scars of many types of cancer. Their stories are inspirational and thought-provoking. They have been selected from far-reaching places illustrating that cancer doesn't discriminate against age, race or gender.  With the success of this Kickstarter campaign, we will be able to reach our goal of being able to travel to the home countries of our contributors and document their stories. Our contributors are from various regions of Australia, New Zealand, U.S.A, Canada and Europe.  We believe that awareness is truly brought into being by new experience. That is what we want to provide. An eye-opening experience.  We're relying on the success of this campaign to take this project with potential for massive reach to its highest height. With this valuable funding, we will push these issues into the limelight instead of seeing them continue to bubble beneath the surface.

Its been 3 yrs now he has been in Heaven longer now then with his family.  Throughout my grieving his loss I dug out all of my videos and pictures I ever have taken of him ,  I edited and spliced together as much footage as I could. I spent days , weeks in my room recluse, heart broken desperate to see my boy one more time even remixed the videos i did make just to try and create some kind of new memory of him. Here 3 years later I miss him even more but have learned to  live again, I have learned to forgive myself for what I could not change what I could not prevent I could not save his life. I still carry a load of guilt  I could not save his life no matter how much I prayed, cried shake my fists at the sky nothing I can do will ever bring him back to my family and me.   I would like to create an Awareness video regarding CHILDHOOD CANCER. With your help ,  Your contribution of $1 dollar would still make a difference they add up  with enough exposure and support , I just want to make it clear this isn't a fundraiser for medical care or needs this is a media experiment 3 years in the thought processing and finally feel I am ready to take the next step .

The approach will be unique and the results will be profound in Addition to the public demonstration and displays , I will also be having my personal vehicle wrapped with STOP CHILDHOOD CANCER Golden Stop Sign and more eye catching graphics to Bring the Awareness level up More People need to know Their child is at risk  This can happen to anyone Heaven forbid maybe even You or your children Please help in anyway you see fit, I Solemnly Promise to not let you down I refuse to let anything stop me from making this a reality .

It's meant for kids, particularly girls ages 10-15, and is the first in a series of books. Despite the focus being intended for girls, it can be enjoyed by girls, boys, or young people who are questoning their gender identity. I first created Shelly when I was just a kid. I can't remember how she came to me, but one day when I was doodling, I created my very first recurring character and her cast of friends. Time passed, and Shelly faded into the back of my head. I had life to experience. It wasn't until recently that I was considering new comic book projects, and Shelly popped back into my head. It blew me away just how much work I had already put into the characters; they just had to be modernized. And so, the modern Shelly was born. No longer a big foot googly-eyed character, she became a thirteen year old girl with a multicultural and eclectic cast of friends -- perfect for a story based in Mississauga (a suburb of Toronto, Ontario). Shelly is a book for girls intended for girls between the ages of 10 and 15, but can be enjoyed by younger children and even adults.. There are plenty of manga, novels, and other literature for girls in that group, but as a kid, I ached for comics for me... for my age! Sadly, not much has changed. Shelly will focus on the girls in the story and teach them that they are important. They matter. Their problems and issues are real. In the first issue of Shelly, her friend Caroline passes away from leukemia and she has a hard time dealing with it.  She reminisces about times past and how they overcame a particularly nasty set of bullies to become friends. It's a book about dealing with grief; about friendship and love; about making tough decisions; about being a kid. By supporting this Kickstarter, you are helping me pay for the printing cost of the book. The total cost for the run of the book is just over $1300 and I am asking for half of that. If I make my goal, I will start adding some nice stretch goals for those who pledged. If I make my full printing goal, even better.

We admit we made mistakes, unfortunately, the biggest was believing the advice the Bank representative gave us. When we applied we were not behind yet, but we knew my husband was getting laid off and that I was ill with what became just the first of many illnesses. They told us that they would not help us until we were 3 months behind, but that then we definitely qualified once we made that mark. What really happened is that we allowed 3 months to go by only to be told that they would no longer accept payments from us and that foreclosure preceding had started. They consistantly 'Lost' our paperwork, and the hours I spent on the phone with them were never noted, we were told we never called or sent in the thousands of papers we had.
We didn't give up, we refused to. So through the pain of pancreatitas and a bad Gall bladder I fought with everything I had. No way was I letting the surgery hold me down. We took the little money we had and invested in the first law firm that specializes is getting Loan modifications. We once again re-submitted every piece of information we had, time and time again because they played the same games on them they did with us of 'Lost paperwork' etc. On June 3rd of 2010 they once again denied our loan mod. The catch? We have emails to our lawyers FROM THE BANK that they denied us using our old paperwork, and not the current. They took our home on information that they knew was not accurate. They sold our home the next day, and the very same bank that sold our home illegally BOUGHT our home.
Our lawyers were able to fight them into rescinding the sale, they knew they had not done things legally, and we again have emails from the bank stating that they had rescinded the sale and were going to push through a loan mod. They lied. It was never rescinded and they sent people to our homes, guns on their hip, with eviction letters. Each time they had to call the eviction off because they had no rights to foreclose on our home in the first place.
We were then informed by our lawyers that we needed to retain NEW councel as they were out of state and couldn't fight in WA courts. We once again had to hire another law group and pay another retainer. Unfortunately during this I was constantly in the Emergency Room and getting numerous CT Scans, Mri's and X-rays to diagnose the pain in my neck. Medical bills were piling up but at last they found the tumor on my thyroid and surgery to remove it was scheduled. It got held back after 3 attempts for a year because each time my blood count was just too low and dangerous to operate.
I'm not going to lie, as tough as I always try to seem and be the strong one, there has been a lot of tears and dealing with the terror of knowing there was a Tumor and trying to fight the banks was so overwhelming at times I didn't know how I was going to deal with everything. But I did. I found some amazing people that supported us and kept me strong.
Our story caught the attention of the King 5 investigators who ran a story on us that you can see here: http://www.king5.com/news/investigators/Bank-errors-leave-Buckley-family-living-in-limbo-fearing-eviction-149928695.html Their help in our case helped tremendously and stopped the current eviction that the bank had just served us yet again. It brought light on what they bank was pulling and suddenly the bank was willing to let us submit (AGAIN!) the paperwork for a loan modification. The catch? The home was still not in our name, meaning they wanted to give us a loan mod and wanted us to pay for a home that they would never be able to be put in our name because the Bank no longer held the note to our home and had no legal rights to it. In other words, the bank wanted to steal our money and then evict us when we least expected it. 
So we went to court. It wasn't cheap, but it was a start. The courts reprimanded them and forbade them from trying to take payments from us. Finally, some light at the end of the tunnel. Unfortunately, just as things were heating up and going our way we got the break up letter from our lawyer who didn't have a complete understanding of Real estate law and had moved to criminal law only. We have been left in the lurch. We've found another law firm whom of which  are simply amazing and specialize in this type of law. What that means though is that the cost of obtaining them is growing more each day but is tremendous in our fight to expose the Bank for the terrible things they have done. We need help desperately,  We're fighting for our home, where our kids grew up and we shouldn't have to be. We have hundreds of pages showing the banks wrongdoing and illegal practices and if we're just given a chance we can make what they've done come to light. 
I don't have the words to explain the stress that this has put on our family, and the pain it has caused. I hate asking for help, but I'm scared and out of options. We so badly need these lawyers that can help us and be there till the end for us and save our home. Our biggest goal in winning is taking the damages we are rewarded and helping the many others that are fighting this fight and need help with the struggle so they don't have to give up their homes that were wrongfully taken from them. What has made our fight so much harder, is the fact that the first lawyer we had, the one that disappeared on us, left us with one final horrible act. Right before she disappeared she filed a claim stating that the sale of our home stood. Obviously we would NEVER have agreed to this and we had no idea it had even happened until months later when were were joining with our current lawyers. That has hurt us badly and while suing for malpractice is an option, with the monthly payments to our current lawyers makes it impossible to afford. All we really want is our home.

Unfortunately, with what she did to us it also means that in our fight, after almost 5 years of fighting the bank might be able to force us to move. That means that after almost 5 years of fighting, because of this one act we might have to leave our home and still keep fighting them after. We will not only have the high monthly payment to our lawyers, but also a whole other payment if we are forced to move.",13.0,1225,56,0.026,30.0,7,1,2014,1,1,23,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,24.587247186856537,0.0,kickstarter

The Peloton Project is a documentary film that will follow the lives of nearly 40 cyclists as they prepare to take on this year’s Cancervive Peloton Project.  Team members must train for a year while raising support for cancer care in their community.  On October 2nd, the Peloton team will embark on a 2,500-mile journey from Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to Lewiston, Maine, for the Dempsey Challenge.  They will complete the ride in just 10 days, cycling relay-style day and night. This means that each of the six teams must complete 100 miles in their 6-hour leg of the relay in order to stay on schedule.  Woven throughout the team’s journey across North America will be stories of cancer survivors, caregivers, and a young woman who has just been diagnosed.  The Peloton Project will look closely at the people behind the cancer diagnoses to see what life is like for them before and after cancer and how they find strength to face the challenge ahead.   Kickstarter pledges will be the seed money for our film.

PLEASE CONTRIBUTE.  :)  In early September of this year, a small group of men with cancer will come together at The Wildhorse Ranch near Mackay, Idaho for a three day fly fishing retreat hosted by the national organization REEL RECOVERY.  Fish On is a feature length documentary film that tells these men's stories and how this retreat and a few hours of enticing a fish to rise impacts them. I am often asked ""why"" I love fly fishing.  One of my many stock answers to that question is ""because the world and all the problems I have in it disappear when I'm knee deep in a river staring down my fly"".  During my many hours on the water, casting, getting tangled up, wading, missing fish, catching fish, hooking my own hat and catching my breath, nothing else seems to exist.  I find myself completely hypnotized by the experience of fishing and long after the final cast of my day, I am always rejuvenated. For years I have wanted to make a film that gives folks a glimpse at the hypnotic and rejuvenating side of fly fishing but had not yet found the right story.  When my good friend (and partner in this endeavor) Reese Ferguison introduced me to the Reel Recovery organization, I knew I had found my story. This is a fishing film that will feature some of the best fly fishing water & scenery in southern Idaho.  A documentary who's purpose is to share the joy, the thrill and the therapy that fly fishing is capable of giving.  I look forward to witnessing how this retreat and casting a few flies, gives these men moments of freedom from the worry that undoubtedly overwhelms them during the difficult times they are facing.   I appreciate each contribution and each individual, group of company who gets behind me and my buddy Reese for this endeavor.  Please take a glimpse at the ""rewards"" we offer for your contribution and PLEASE contribute right now.   contact us with any questions at: fishonmovie@gmail.com  follow us on Facebook  - www.facebook.com/fishonmovie",247.47058823529412,382,19,1.05175,40.0,6,3,2012,1,1,23,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

What began as a one-time gig playing cover songs for their fellow surgeons, turned into a fantasy come true when they realized their music could be more powerful than their medicine in the fight against women’s cancers. Dancing with N.E.D., a documentary in progress, follows the rock band No Evidence of Disease (N.E.D.) on their journey from their unlikely beginnings to becoming a rock sensation and the “lightning rod” of an awareness movement seeking to break through the wall of silence surrounding GYN cancers in women. This deadly disease affects 90,000 women and claims 30,000 lives every year, including familiar faces like Saturday Night Live comedian Gilda Radner and President Obama’s mother. If Dancing with N.E.D is produced and the movement succeeds in creating awareness, badly needed research funding could follow and the deaths of thousands of women may be prevented. The only thing standing in our way is an age old taboo about the C word, a lack of financing, competition between cancer groups for attention and funding, and sustaining a band that is forced to rehearse over the Internet since their practices are scattered across the country in Alaska, Louisiana, New York, Oregon, and North Carolina. Dancing with N.E.D. is also the story of women who discover they have a GYN cancer and face the prospect of dying before having children, having to decide to choose their life over having children, or losing their life before they get to see their children grow up; the sadness, the anger, the fear, the courage and the hope they feel as their unpredictable journeys test their strength and convictions and that of their loved ones. And it is the story of their doctors, the people who guide them through that unpredictable journey and who are there every step of the way. As Dr. Soper, one of the band members says: “People think we just deal with it and put it away. But we don’t. We take it with us wherever we go.” Your donation will help us continue to keep filming at a critical time. The band, their families, and the patients suffering from the disease all have a lot riding on their success. The film can either propel them into the limelight and jumpstart a movement or the whole experiment could implode, the doctors disband and the movement loses its brightest prospect. How many grandmothers, mothers, wives, girlfriends, and sisters must suffer before GYN cancer gets the attention and funding it so desperately deserves?
The doctors and their patients are approaching critical crossroads in their fight to survive. We cannot stop filming now.

Skating Through It is a thirty-two minute documentary featuring multiple interviews and b-roll of Andy, Shannon and Chris in their homes, with family members, at rinks and additional locations such as doctor's offices and hospitals.  Also featured are interviews with former Olympic skaters Charles Tickner, Mark Janoschak, and Mark Militano, as well as other champion adult skaters and coaches. The profile footage was shot by professional film/television DPs and I shot all of the on-ice practice footage of the skaters.  The competition programs at the U.S. Adult National Championships in Dallas, Texas were covered by a local six-person crew. Many wonderful pros were involved in the production. The credits are listed on the documentary website.  The documentary has finally reached the FINE CUT stage!  This Kickstarter campaign is to raise funds for some of the urgent finishing costs (at discounted rates): color correction, title design, sound mix, and music underscore (by Joel Diamond, who has been composing for over twenty years with credits including Milarepa and Welcome to the Dollhouse). Contributions far exceeding the goal are very much needed and will be used for screenings around the country throughout the next year, as well as efforts to get the documentary into festivals, television broadcasts, distribution deals, and online platforms.  Funds are needed as well for recoupment of research, production and editing costs.  The total documentary budget is $295k. When the full budget amount has been raised, I will also be able to complete: ten-minute portraits of two additional competitive skaters that were filmed during the production phase (Leslie and Tara); memorial video tributes to two wonderful, dedicated skaters who participated in the documentary (Paula Smart and Kenny Isely); and the documentary footage archive, connected to the website, featuring funny and moving clips from various competitions and interviews with champion and famous elite skaters.  Please contribute at the highest level that you're able to. I will endeavor to send rewards to you as quickly as possible, ideally before estimated delivery dates.  Kickstarter has a limit of $10k for contributions, so the International Documentary Association is serving as my fiscal sponsor to allow for contributions at higher levels that are fully tax-deductible (or partially tax-deductible with rewards). The high levels that I'm offering are: SILVER - $15k for Associate Producer credit (2 people); PLATINUM  - $25k for Producer credit (2 people); and GOLD - $50k for Executive Producer credit (1 person).

My book, The Songs of Solomon: A Pillow Book For Breast Cancer Survivors & Their Lovers, is written and illustrated with specific consideration of the challenges faced by survivors of breast cancer —  I feel this is an extremely important project. Current statistics are that 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer. I see these women as champions and warriors, and I have created a book to reflect that spirit. My intention was to design not only a resource, but a work of art…not only a tool, but something beautiful filled with passion, strength, and love. With your support my intention is to make this book available to the public through Amazon and Kindle- It will be self published online and hard copies will be available.February
of 2014. My art aims to show women who have had mastectomies, rebuilds, or lumpectomies as beautiful love warriors.  I HAVE THE POWER, was on the cover of August issue of THE WHOLE PERSON MAGAZINE. Click here to read article. As you scroll down you'll see rough draft examples of the interior design of the pillow book- In the past 18 months, my work has been written about in various
publications which include the Kinsey Institute (Kinsey Institute for
Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University, founded
in 1947 by pioneer sexuality researcher Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey), 
Here's a link to the piece they wrote:  THE KINSEY CONFIDENTIAL I  was the featured artist in the Pasadena Weekly and my work appeared on the cover of the Whole Person magazine. Here are links to the articles: PASADENA WEEKLY- BEYOND THE BODY These women are amazons, warriors who have faced cancer and overcome it!  An amazon is a warrior who nurtures and can hunt for herself and her family. Amazons were known to cut off their left breast in order to become better archers. We live in a world where sexuality is not fully appreciated. Yet, I feel
 that the public is now ready to open the dialogue of breast cancer, a 
transformed body, and sexual intimacy. With your help this book can be birthed! I researched the internet to see if such a pillow book existed. Imagine my surprise when I saw none! I know that there has been a huge gap in the dialogue of breast cancer
and sexuality and I've decided to take this challenge on as my personal
mission.  That‘s why I am coming to you. I need
your help. I’ve put together a list of some wonderful gifts for you to
enjoy. I want to thank you for your support. Any extra funds received  make it possible for me to tour the pillow book and
stage talks at Oncology centers and breast cancer support groups here in L.A. and I hope beyond.  These extra funds will also help me to pay for expenses associated with this project; travel expenses, tools, printing flyers, setting up shows(proper framing of the images) and other unforeseen expenses that may come up.   I will be able to buy a projector so that I can show the book and read from the Song of Songs,I'd also like the opportunity to donate copies of the book to centers and individuals -  I hope that
women and their partners will gain healing from the images and the love poems
and that they will reconnect sexually to each other in a deeper level to discover
the power of their love for each other.  Namaste, Toni ",37.92307692307692,686,31,0.493,31.39752314814815,11,5,2013,1,1,23,breast cancer,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

that the wisdom gained from their journey will not be lost. This film will be shown at retreats, conferences and peer supporter trainings around North America as well as a teaser before screenings of another film I produced in conjunction with Hands On Films, called Wrong Way to Hope: An Inspiring Story of Young Adults and Cancer (www.wrongwaytohope.com). 100% of the money that is raised will directly to pay for the filming, post production and editing costs (minus approx. $100 for

You would think you get accustomed to the whole ordeal after going through it several times. But you would be wrong. I suppose you could think similar is true for many illnesses. But there is something so diabolical about cancer. Maybe the fact that it eventually takes all your dignity away, literally eats you up from inside, and crushes you with pain. Maybe the fact that you are on the list of the worldwide number one killer. Unfortunately, the majority of us have had contact with cancer, in some form. If not directly suffering from it, then indirectly, by taking care of and observing our loved one - family member or friend - through this ordeal. The four times cancer cropped up in my life, I remember all the confusion in my family... The plethora of questions, fluctuations in emotional state. And this was in us who were the caregivers. How much worse was it for the beloved ones who were directly suffering from cancer. Often what happens is that - doctors are not available to answer all our questions; family members’ visits sometimes exhaust more than help; attending a support group meeting is physically not possible; listening to all the laymen advice about diets and alternative treatments irritates... In such a setting a person who is affected by cancer becomes more confused, frustrated and lonely. What is needed are services that are easily accessible from the comfort of the home, anonymous, yet informative and attending to the user's tender emotional state. Personalized online cancer-based services resolve these issues – they enable the user to reach the most relevant content (based on their interests, demographics, even emotions), in the easiest and fastest manner possible. However, from my experience, the vast resources of quality information accessible on existing global health portals, were not truly personalized to my needs. And none of them attended to how I as a caregiver felt. More importantly they did not attend to the emotional state of the cancer patient. So the only solution I came up with was to build, from scratch, an online system that is personalized, and additionally tailors its services to user's emotional state. Teaming up with a then-newly-found cancer association PORT, which had a small online based community, we started a project to set up a personalized health website. That was two years ago. The website has so far gone through 2 phases of development. The prototype of it was launched a year ago and is accessible on http://new.port.org.ba/.   Personalization based on user emotional state However, to make an actual difference and bring the main goal of this project to life - provide personalization based on user emotional state - requires your help. Using the website prototype, 3 studies have been carried out so far to identify if emotions: All the results suggest that user’s emotional state does stimulate the preference for certain website features. Our aim is, therefore, to collect user’s emotions upon arrival to the website, and then use the findings of the studies to predict which features to recommend based on how the user is feeling. This will be done in the following manner: 1. User visits the website. 2. Upon log-in, an emotion tool (see image) opens. 3. User is asked to subjectively report the intensity of emotions s/he is feeling from among the offered on the list.  4. A background algorithm matches the emotional state of the user with the preferred website content types (forum discussions, blogs, articles) and personalization features.  5. The identified features and content types are then highlighted/recommended to the user. 6. Emotions are further used to make specific content recommendations. The user interacts with the website, and at every content viewing is asked to rate the content, as well as express their emotional state. Content ratings and emotional states are integrated to determine the content the user has not viewed, but would be interested in, especially considering the emotional state they are in.  Chatroom Another important segment of the website is the chatroom. Enabling users to exchange content between each other, in real-time, in group conversations, is one aspect. But a more important aspect is to have a “private space” - a part of the website where a user can engage in one-on-one communication, of more sensitive nature, with designated medical professionals (e.g., MD or psychologist). The chatroom is currently available in the basic form of message exchange. Users can join and post instant messages to each other. But the one-on-one messaging needs developing.   Budget breakdown Our goal is to raise  £3000 (approx. $4500). The funding will be used to cover the development of the following: And most importantly, to make sure the features we develop actually satisfy the target users’ needs, we need to evaluate the website by: The planned distribution of funds is shown in the graph below.  We are expecting that the launch date of the website with the implemented emotion-based personalization features will be May-July 2016.  The people behind this project are researchers, computer scientists, web developers and designers, doctors and pharmacists, journalists and economists; but most of all people on whose life cancer left a deep trace, thus wishing to turn their experience into a useful one for others facing this illness. Our Reps  Since its start in 2012, 20 members joined PORT’s initial virtual community. With the launching of the prototype of the personalized website http://new.port.org.ba/ in October 2014, the numbers have increased to 130 registered users. There is an obvious desire for personalization and interactivity of the health website.  The PORT website does not restrict its services to a selected population. PORT is an NGO established in Bosnia and Herzegovina – that is why we offer all the content in Bosnian language. But we have put effort into making PORT’s services accessible to target users around the globe by providing bilingual content - an English version of the website. Cancer is not a local occurrence, and curing and alleviating the consequences of this illness should not be restricted to the fortunate, wealthy, few. Knowledge about existing and accessible treatments, about experience, breakthroughs, costs, doctors, and all-else-cancer-wise, should be globally shared, exchanged and made aware of. The PORT team urges our members to write and share content in English, to be universally relevant and comprehensive.  And finally, to anyone who has faced cancer, or sadly might in the future, this project has great meaning.

It's a fictional story inspired by events from my own life.  As some of you may know, I’ve been a firefighter in Wayne, NJ for over 15 years. In 2009, my mom passed away within 10 months of being diagnosed with cancer. The story was inspired when I found a photo taken of me a few days before my mom died, where I was fighting a large fire in Paterson, NJ.  My mom, seeing the incident on the news, commented on how brave I was.   I remember being taken back by that, thinking that firefighters go into burning buildings with unique knowledge and training, expecting to come out alive. But my mom was facing certain death, and no amount of knowledge or training would change that. Yet, even in her final days, her graceful spirit, attitude and demeanor exemplified bravery unlike anything I've ever seen in my life.  I realized that day that bravery is not the absence of fear, but rather the choices you make when fear grips you, overwhelms you and consumes you.  Brave is a combination of many things: my most passionate work in screenwriting; my most ambitious attempt to further my career as a director; a collection of professional favors; unique access to resources for filming; etc.  But above all, Brave is a tribute to my mom, her story, and those with stories like her's.  For the last 10 years, I’ve been climbing the ranks in television working as a producer and director for many different kinds of project.  After moving into scripted content and directing some truly extraordinary projects, (including a sketch comedy for MTV and two seasons of an emmy-nominated western, Gunslingers) I fell in love with narrative projects.  While I’ve been extremely fortunate to be able to make a living doing what every film student dreams of, I’m at a crossroad in my career.  In order for me to be considered for Hollywood movies and larger episodic TV shows, every director, generally, needs to make their own film and have it accepted into one of the top film festivals.  This is a necessary part of the film industry; it’s where studio executives find new directors. It's also where directors have the opportunity to show off their style and ability, and prove that they can execute. This project is like my master's degree in film.  I’m going to spend a lot of money and time on something with no guaranteed return on investment, but its an exciting opportunity to take the next step in my career and challenge me as a director to show the world my very best work. And I hope you'll join me for the journey! BUDGET: $20k  SHOOT DAYS: 3  TIMELINE:  We'll be shooting in mid August with the intention to submit to film festivals by mid-September.

It's the seemingly inevitable villian who strikes when you least expect it, leaving you emotionally, physically, and mentally drained. Some manage to make it out alive, some don't. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 1.6 million people will be diagnosed with cancer in 2017, while over 600-thousand are expected to die.  NOW'S THE TIME!!

Her family drops everything and gives up their lives to make sure that she's here to fight the good fight. With doctors ruling out a cure, Marie will have to use Chinese medicine and holistic methods as her weapon in this battle for her life. But will that be enough or is it too late? If only we knew...

9185a6e4530e61e2c3919f016eaf0b43,A GIFT OF THE HEART,"Hope, love, faith and humility, pitted against racism, hate, economic injustice, and - cancer. A tough battle, but hope and love win.",2017-08-07 15:50:51,2017-11-22 04:51:09,2018-01-21 04:51:09,41500,False,False,0,15,621.0,621.0,USD,USD,1.0,film & video,US,GA,Town,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1619646093/a-gift-of-the-heart-0?ref=category_newest,"Juan Carrera is a Cuban immigrant, uneducated. He provides for his son Ali with the money he earns in an underground fight club, sacrificing his body and his dignity. It's the only way he knows how to survive. Sam Goldberg is a successful attorney. His daughter Sydney becomes friends with Ali. Sydney and Ali, as children, don't see color, or religion, or economic disparity. Their hopes and dreams are pure, and they enjoy spending time together as friends.   Ali (the boy) has an incurable brain disease. It is terminal. Sydney (the girl) develops a life-threatening heart ailment which will require a transplant. She has an uncommon blood type. What follows is alternatively painful and also beautiful. The two families are thrust into a new dynamic which teaches them that their differences are superficial. If they work together, they can preserve a human life. One family's tragedy can become another family's salvation.  This is ultimately a film about friendship, tolerance, and sacrifice. It contains elements of hope, faith, and redemption. It strives to present these elements in a seamless manner. A Gift of the Heart shows us that beneath our surface-level differences, we're not very different at all.  === Says Austin St John: ""My character (Sam Goldberg) starts out as a bigot. His daughter's condition brings forth a reality he had buried because he thought it was beneath him. He grows, coming full circle, mentally and emotionally. This film touches intelligently on social injustice. It also shows the suffering associated with cancer and other health conditions with a gentle, hopeful touch. This is a film with heart and soul. It will touch you deeply. I'm happy to be involved.""  === Few things are as important to us as our health. Yet for some reason, our health tends to be something we often take for granted, until ... And we all know people that have had battles with cancer, and we all lost people to cancer. The writer of this film - Andrew Heller - lost his mom to cancer. Andrew himself, featured performer and Executive Producer Austin St. John, Executive Producer Marie Adler, and young actress Chalet Lizette Brannan have all survived cancer.  Often times when we know people that are in ill health, if they are over a certain age we consider to be ""old"", we rationalize it as natural. But you can't rationalize much when serious ill health strikes a child. This is a pivotal aspect of A Gift of the Heart. In this film the gift of the heart is not only an apt expression, it is literal. A dying boy gives his heart to save a sick girl in need. And all the prejudices and all the injustice melts away. Everyone grows from the humanity of the gesture. This is what humanity is meant to be and we should never forget that.  === Says John Schneider: ""My character (Dr. Eli Heller) is a highly competent doctor who is a pragmatist. He is touched by the children in the film, their hope, faith, and innocence. This film uses human tragedy to send an important message to the world.. You will enjoy it, I promise."" === People are polarized. The most common is the have's versus the have nots. But there are ethnic and cultural differences, too, as well as the chasm between modern technology and longstanding tradition. A Gift of the Heart mirrors the polarization that has become far too prevalent in the world. But it takes the hate and fear, subjects it to turmoil and tragedy, and the outcome is rescue, followed by humility and faith. The film delivers its message realistically, through characters and story, without preaching.  Ali and his family are Cuban immigrants. They hang onto their pride as best they can while struggling to survive. Sydney and her parents are well-to-do and her father Sam shows disdain for the downtrodden.  The ultimate contrast is between the adults and the children. The children have youth, are full of hope, they don't see color and socioeconomic class. They are un-jaded. When Ali and Sydney each contract a serious illness, they teach the adults all around them the ultimate lesson of togetherness and sacrifice. As people we may have our differences but those with a truthful perspective will come to know that our similarities are way more pronounced. This is an important message of the film.  === Says Tim Russ (Director): “This is a timely and - I believe - also a timeless movie that needs to be seen and heard at a time when our world desperately needs to see and feel hope, humility and compassion. To me, it is reminiscent of ""It's a Wonderful Life"". I am thankful I get to direct such a heart warming tale.” === Austin St. John as Sam Goldberg You'll remember Austin ( As The Original Red Ranger) from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and A Walk With Grace. John Schneider as Dr. Eli Heller You'll remember John from The Dukes of Hazzard and Smallville Chalet Lizette Brannan as Adalia You'll recognize Chalet from Cyborg X, Junkie, and The Sparrows: Nestling Luis Fernandez-Gill as Juan Carrera; featured in Telenova and TV's Mike and Molly Eve Mauro as Grace Goldberg; featured in CSI: Miami, Dexter, and Always Sunny in Philadelphia Isabel Serrano as Dr. Fernando; featured in Love in Difficult Times and Acusados Andrew Heller - Writer and Producer Andrew Heller was born in South Africa, migrated to the US 1983, joined SAG in 1988, worked steadily as an actor, later as a writer, and built a successful video company. He started a construction firm while he raised his three kids, and now that they are grown, he has returned to his passion for the arts. He is a disabled veteran. He is committed to helping families deal with cancer. He seeks to foster hope and a positive spirit of humanity through he uplifting message of his books and films. Tim Russ - Director Tim was born to a military family, grew up in a host of places, graduated high school in Turkey. As an actor he appeared in episodes of Melrose Place, Star Trek: Voyager, and many others. He has worked in film and theater. He has directed 15 films and 30 TV episodes. Credits include Bloomers, The Later Show, and episodes of Star Trek: Renegades. He is also an avid singer and songwriter.  Marie Adler - Executive Producer Marie Adler is the CEO and founder of Adler and Associates Entertainment, the worldwide distributor for A Gift of the Heart. In 2001, with a small team of seven employees and big vision, she took over American Financial Lending and built it into a huge and successful mortgage bank, before turning her attention to Hollywood. The Adler and Associates philosophy includes an emphasis on bridging gaps between cultures, nations, races, languages and religions, and putting great effort into educating the world and killing hatred by using film as our medium. A Gift of the Heart could have no greater ally. She is also a cancer survivor.  Austin St. John - Executive Producer Austin was born in Roswell, New Mexico. He has practiced martial arts since he was five and now holds a second-degree black belt in Tae-Kwon Do, and a first-degree black belt in Judo. He speaks four languages, being of German, Irish, and Spanish descent. According to a 2004 contest held by ABC Family, Austin's character Jason Lee Scott was voted as the greatest Red Ranger of all time. Austin embraced A Gift of the Heart as soon as he heard its message, and is both a lead performer and an Executive Producer of the film.    Says Andrew Heller, Writer/Producer:  ""I started conceiving the book on which this film is based in 1992. My mother had just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. My daughter was born only six months before my mom passed away. My mom never got to meet my two sons. When she passed, many unresolved issues between us caused me pain, and I regret that fact, to this day.  He death affected me. It is as though I entered a different world and shelved the book and movie for many years. It was only after I suffered injuries in a major motorcycle accident that I regained my perspective, and brought the story back to life. It has since risen to become my mission and purpose. Like so many reading this, I have lost many friends to cancer and have made it part of my mission to be compassionate to those suffering from this terrible affliction. My situation with my mom is embedded in the story of Sam Goldberg who was able to reconcile his past self with a new, more meaningful perspective too. Nothing makes me happier than hearing comments from people who have read the script that liken the film to those of Frank Capra or Preston Sturgess. A Gift of the Heart comes from my heart. My sincere thanks to all who are able to support in any amount or in any way."" CAN YOU MIX AND MATCH? Yes, you can.

And finally we want to collaborate with other like-minded people, lovers of humanity, equality, respect - things the world seems to struggle with too much these days.  What better place for us than Kickstarter? - Where indie films are welcome and supported, where communities form, thrive, and interact every day, and collaboration ... is a way of life.  If you've got questions, we've got answers.

THE MORE WE CAN RAISE THE BETTER THIS WILL BE.
Thanks to everyone that pledged or spread the word and helped us make this happen!! We're excited to get started..
************************************************************
Slightly cynical, slightly irreverent, and REALLY hilarious, ""Terminally Illin"" is a candid look into the life of a young adult battling cancer, but with a psychedelic-sci-fi twist! It’s more than a comic book: It’s provocative, educational, entertaining, and totally original. Our heroine travels inside her own body with her pet battle-kitty, to take on the evil nazi tumors, cancer aliens, and The Tumornator - on a microscopic level, where cancer starts. Entering the world of cancer feels a lot like falling down the rabbit hole - think of ""Terminally Illin"" as a crazy, chemo-induced Alice in Wonderland adventure, with as much 'Family Guy humor' that we could squeeze in. By using humor and creative visualization (guided imagery) as a way to cope with harsh cancer treatments, Kaylin was able to keep her attitude positive during treatment. She teamed up with Jon to write several story lines. These comics brought hours of laughter to us throughout all of the pain, and we want to bring this laughter to you and to others that might find it inspiring. Our goal is to publish this epic adventure and give it away to others with cancer, and you can help make it happen! FOR EVERY COMIC BOOK SOLD, WE'LL GIVE ONE TO A CANCER PATIENT. We've partnered with KickStarter.com to offer you an easy and secure way to become a part of our project. Your pre-order will count as a pledge to help fund the release of ""Terminally Illin'"", and the more you pledge, the more you get! But if we don't reach funding for our goal by the set date, you won't get charged for your pledge and we won't be able to produce this comic... SO PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THIS AWESOME PROJECT! YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE! Check out the rewards column on the right side of the screen for more details about making a pledge. (*If you have cancer and would like to get on our list to receive the free comic book, please email us at: info@terminallyillin.com)HERE'S A FEW HIGHLIGHTS OF WHAT WE PLAN TO HAVE IN THE COMIC: - illustrated narrative pages from Kaylin's very personal blog she kept during treatment. - several short 1-2 page comic funnies dealing with cancer that are irreverent, cynical, and really hilarious. - 20-30 page chemo-induced 'Alice in Wonderland'. We take you from the beginning of chemo to the end through all the symptoms down a little rabbit hole called a chemo port. - and a whole lot more.... As you can see this is a very ambitious undertaking. The more we can raise, the more time and focus and budget we'll have to make this the best it can be. After Kickstarter and Amazon take their 8-10% off the top, nearly 1/2 of the remaining expenses will be publishing, shipping, merchandise cost, and production. The other half will cover about 3 months of bare minimum expenses for Kaylin and Jon while they work on this comic day and night. We really can't make this happen without your help! Our production estimate is based on publishing 1500 copies of a 32 page, full-color comic book ($3000 just for publishing! That doesn't include the cost of tees, scarves, shipping, etc). If we can raise more than our goal, we'd like to add more pages, consider using higher quality paper to print on, and add more variety to the designs you choose from. We have over 60 pages of storyboards to narrow down, and we'd like to include as much of it as possible. So hopefully we can raise more than our goal to make this the best it can be! We estimate it will take us 4-6 months to finish the illustrations and publish the comic book once we get funding. But we also do not want to rush it. We intend on delivering you a brilliant story, well-illustrated, and full of laughs, gasps, and sass. A true work of art with some awesome custom t-shirts, scarves, and buttons to go along with it. And just so you don't have to wait until the comic book is finished to get your rewards, we will ship your t-shirts, scarves, buttons, magnets, and stickers soon after we reach our funding goal! We'll get your t-shirt size info and what styles you want through email. But if you'd rather wait until the comic is finished to receive all of your rewards, we will have even more great designs to choose from!THIS COMIC BOOK WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT! It will arrive at your doorstep, signed by the artists, with your name published in it. If you pledge enough you can be drawn into the story! This is a unique opportunity to become involved in a very special project.PLEASE CONSIDER BECOMING INVOLVED!
Even if you don't want to pledge, please tell a friend!

We often talked about opening a restaurant together when she was ready to retire from nursing. We made notes and worked out every detail of our future project. We planned a menu targeted toward anything from big fat greasy food to choices for the more health conscious or restricted diet guest, developed recipes, planned a theme and a detailed business plan and mission. We wanted our establishment to stand out from the competition by providing gourmet high quality home style choices,  exceptional customer service and an atmosphere that makes everyone comfortable.  In early 2014 my mother became ill and after some testing was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic t-cell leukemia. This was devastating news. My mother learned that if treatment were successful,  she would never be able to work as a nurse again. We promised each other that when she was better we would begin work on our restaurant. My mom lost her fight on 02-09-15. I feel that the best way to honor my mom is to go through with it and make her dream a reality. If you can help me reach that goal i would be forever grateful. ",20.0,209,12,2.6666666666666667e-05,59.958333333333336,2,1,2016,1,1,27,leukemia,1,0,1,0,0.004784688995215311,0.0,0.8468697123519459,1.0,0.0,kickstarter

Now, imagine that each project presented comes from a University or Institution that is doing Cancer Research! That is correct, a crowd-funding base site dedicated to Cancer Research ONLY! One of the greatest features of crowd-funding is the ability to donate directly to support a specific cause or sponsor research that one feels a personal attachment to! You will know exactly to what research you are contributing! The best of all is that we can help researchers to do more research by:  - Helping them raise funds faster and expend less time doing all of the paperwork required for grants  - Given more researches a chance to actually do research since grants are limited. It is the future of Cancer Research! It is people backing doctors and staff to fight cancer, research by research. In addition, only accredited Universities, Institutions and Organizations can present their project, something that we will work on our end to ensure. Furthermore, the research funds raised by the site will follow the same guidelines as used by university and institutions nationwide...in other words, the money is used do to research not to pay faculty. What are we raising funds for? This Kickstarter Project was create to raise funds for the first year of the WFCR project. The funds raised here will be used to create a powerful website that can handle all the projects submitted by the institutions, it will also secure the salary of the required staff and the initial Marketing needs so the project can function properly and reach the intended market. This is not a Charitable Donation, but the funding of a project for its first year only. We intent to continue the project after the first year through a small profit over each project submitted to our website. How does it work? It is a website where you will first select the type of cancer that it is more important to you, under the page specific to each cancer you will find a number of researches being proposed. University A, B, C and Institution A, B, C. You will ready their ideas and what they plan for the research (just like other funding site) and they you will back the one that interested you the most or the one that you see a real outcome!

.  The Crowdfunding Industry Report by Massolution released data showing the overall crowdfunding industry has raised $2.7 billion in 2012, across more than 1 million individual campaigns globally. In 2013 the industry is projected to grow to $5.1 billion. Many crowdfunding success stories are through funded projects that were successful because they were made viral by one person starting the crowdfunding donation page and sharing it with other people. People who ""like"" the crowdfunding donation page and ask their friends to like it too, then have the friends of their friends like it and so on. This builds the momentum needed to make crowdfunding a success. The word spreads and many crowdfunding success stories are not only funded quickly, but far exceed the expectations of the funding amount initially targeted.
 
Crowdfunding has even received the endorsement of President Obama and at the White House on June 4, 2013 a dozen entrepreneurs who used crowdfunding for start-ups and innovative projects were recognized as “Champions of Change.” As Thomas Kalil, Deputy Director for Technology and Innovation for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, noted in the event’s press release, “Crowdfunding is the 21st century equivalent of barn-raising. We can use it to help our neighbors and fellow citizens start a business, enrich our culture, and apply grassroots creativity and imagination to challenges big and small.”  While crowdfunding is still somewhat new in regards to funding medical research projects such as cancer research, WFCR  is certain that new donors for medical research projects can be reached through crowdfunding in ways that they were previous unable to do so. The number of new cancer cases that occur in the U.S. each year is expected to surge as the population grows and ages; by the year 2030, that number will be over 50 percent higher than it is now. The good news, say experts at the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR), is that this figure can be significantly reduced if Americans start making healthy lifestyle changes today and more effective treatments are discovered. WFCR's goal is to afford the opportunity to as many cancer research projects as possible in an effort to discover treatments that would have otherwise not been discovered due to lack of funding or awareness, or both. Crowdfuding  Of all the innovative advances in online fundraising over the past decade, one of the most impressive has to be the rise of crowdfunding websites. Some of these sites, like Fundraise.com, CauseVox and Fundly were set up specifically to help non-profits raise money to support their causes.  Others, like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, aren’t non-profit specific but have been used by charities to raise money to support their mission. The entire crowdfunding market grew by 81 percent last year, funding more than one million campaigns, according to Massolution, which recently issued its crowdfunding report for 2012. Western countries accounted for approximately 95 percent of the total market. Carl Esposti, CEO of Massolution, says that he expects the crowdfunding market to nearly double again in 2013.
 
If anything, these figures demonstrate that communities around the country (and around the world) are hungry to support and contribute to issues and organizations important to them. Everything from film and TV projects to natural disaster relief has been funded with the help of the crowd. Charitable organizations and those seeking donations from private individuals are quickly learning the power of utilizing crowdfunding as a way to gain support from the online community. Watsi, a prominent nonprofit that funds medical care for people in need, raised $1.2 million from a seed funder that usually only benefits for-profit startups, according to a recent press release. After being the first charity to work with Silicon-Valley startup accelerator Y-Combinator, Watsi joined a small list of nonprofits that have secured investments from angel investors.  I believe that we, together, can end this. It may be a dream, but dreams are achievable as long as you believe. This dream, the dream of ending cancer require all of us to believe. Thank you very much for taking your time to read about this project. I hope you can be part of this amazing initiative.

If you are concerned about skin cancer or melanoma, you need to hear this message. It could save your life! Aloha. Please take the time to watch our videos because your life is worth it! Everyone on the planet earth needs Ultra Violet Protection Clothing. We all know that Melanoma, and Skin Cancers have skyrocketed worldwide. The James Prattas Company and T1O2 is a five year project in progress, designed to introduce natural solutions to a global problem. We are all bombarded by UV radiation, Satellite Signals, Wi-FI,  and many other environmental toxins in our modern life.  Our goal is to provide safe new proven scientific alternatives to minimize UV radiation and  the resulting skin cancers and melanomas.  We help create a healthy personal environment by offering natural Environmental Protective Clothing (EPC) for everyone to use.                         HOW DOES OUR TECHNOLOGY WORK? (1)  Our proprietery Magnetic T1O2 Titanium particles are combined with Nano-Rutile TiO2 and Nano-Anatase TiO2 under very high temperature above 1000 Degrees. (2) Then the proprietery magnetic particles are bound into the material fibers by a process which uses Tesla electric current to stabilize the bonding. (3) Inside the yarns of different materials, the Titanium particles remain permanently bonded and do not wash out. This material is Odorless.                                      BENEFITS OF TITANIUM (1) T1O2 WARMTH.  Our own Far Infrared Rays (FIR) are reflected back into us, and they penetrate into the skin's subcutaneous layers, where it converts into radiante heat (infrared energy). This raises the body temperature. The heat wicks through the material and all of a sudden you are very comfortable.  What is also very unique about this material is that you can swim, run, bicycle or do any sport in very sunny hot weather and be protected from UV radiation 100% and be COOL; and you can also wear this same shirt in Aspen, Colorado during Ski Season when it is cold out and be warm. It has reverse properties due to the (FIR) mechanics. T1O2 is also very good for Senior Citizens during the winter season who want to keep warm. (2) T1O2 IMPROVED BLOOD CIRCULATION Our Far Infrared Rays creates water molecules resonance, which increases H2O hydration capacity in our blood vessels. With good hydrating water molecules inside of our expanded blood capillaries and veins, our human body fluids, Red Blood Cells and White Blood Cells are thinner, thus better blood circulation and better health in all climates. (3) T1O2 DETOXIFICATION The warmth from our radiant heat (infrared energy) helps to flush out Toxic Substances, Heavy Metals and other Cell Waste products through our sweat and sebaceous (fat) glands in the human skin while excersizing during sports or any other physical activity. T1O2 IMPROVED IMMUNE RESPONCE (4) Our improved blood circulation leads to increased metabolism. Far Infrared Rays aid in the production of Nitric Oxide. White blood cells require nitric oxide in the defense against cancerous cells in humans and animals. Nitric Oxide is a key element of the immune system and allows cellular healing to take place. Infrared stimulation is an ideal way to maintain Cardiovascular Conditioning according to NASA. (5) T1O2 CALMING EFFECT                        ""The vitamins of the air."" Because of the Increased Oxygen Flow in our body and the magnetic particles more negative ions are created when we wear this proprietary T1O2 material. Negative ions are known to protect us from germs. The negative ions aura induce alpha brain waves spreading from the occipital area to the parietal, temporal and even to the frontal lobes. The alpha waves distributed evenly on the right and left hemispheres of the brain create an overall calming effect. (6) T1O2 INCREASED AWARENESS The negative ions that are created promote alpha brain waves and increases brain wave amplitude. Our brain achieves a higher awareness level. This is all possible due to the fact we are being detoxed and our circulation is improved as we go about our day. You can imagine the benifits to children, sport athletes, the construction industry and even senior citizens. (7) T1O2 NERVOUS SYSTEM REGULATION Excersize creates Seratonin in humans. Seratonin affects our human neuromuscular, endocrine and metabolic systems affecting our sleep quality, depression, anxiety, heacheaches. Negative ions reduce seratonin levels. (8) T1O2 UV BLOCKING PROTECTION UVA: Skin Aging, Wrinkles, DNA Damage, Skin Cancer and Melanoma. UVB: Skin Cancer and DNA Mutation. Our T1O2 Proprietery material has UVA and UVB Bloking Properties. Our material is UPF 50+ and 100% UV Protection. Our materials are tested by ARPANSA a UV, UPF, UVA, UVB testing agency of the Australian Government. The best in the world. Australia is bombarded by serious UV Radiation and the Australian Government monitors UV fabric. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation present in Sunlight, WiFi, EMF and Satellite Signals are an environmental human carcinogen. It is true we all need some sun light for good health. The problem is the holes in our ozone layers on earth that do not filter the UV radiation due to modern societies human created environmental pollution. (9) DEODORIZATION T1O2 can be worn for weeks at a time. Self Deodorizing. Great Clothing for Trekkers, Mountain Climbers, Fishermen and outdoor enthusiasts who need to minimize the amount of clothes they carry or wear of their journey. Our T1O2 materials are especially wonderful and safe for our Children and those who enjoy Outdoor Activities such as Swiming, Running, Cycling, Sking, Surfing, Kayaking, Paddle Boarding, Skate Boarding, Trekking, Fishing, Hunting, Walking, Gardening, and the Construction Trades, who are the most vulnerable, to Senior Citizens who are dealing with a lifetime of over exposure to damaging UV radiation and Melanoma in all countries.  We all need UV Protection. Because of environmental human pollution and worldwide climate changes to our ozone layers we need new age clothing. Just like the actors in the movies of Star Trek, Star Wars and Avatar, they all dressed in protective stylish comfortable clothing. We are all prince & princess's. We all need T1O2 protection today. We have spent many years studying UV protective materials to discover what will protect us from the sun's radiation and environmental damage.  We know we have personally tested our and many other companies UV materials more than anyone else on the planet earth. We have lived and slept in T1O2 clothes for a week at a time. The material detoxes itself. T1O2 feels like protective skin of a higher power. We have created the most Silky, Cooling and Comfortable UV Anti-Skin Cancer material that breathes, wicks, and is more luxurious than any other proprietery material available today worldwide. With compelling evidence, we are proud to introduce to you a safe new dependable alternative to the failed options previously available.
 We are seeking funds for materials, manufacturing, sales, logistics, Global  marketing and franchises worldwide. Our domestic ""Made in America"" manufacturing facility in San Francisco, CA, is currently capable of producing 10,000 garments per month with room for expansion.

“Strapstastic” Remember those tired looking, plain, and ugly bra straps
which don’t exactly compliment anything you’re wearing? You know, the sneakily
ones which reveal themselves from time to time, that wear down quickly and
don’t offer that perfect fit? You’re probably wearing some right now.   Oh No! Call the fashion police!
 Well, our patented product
“Strapstastic” is definitely not that!  We’ve taken bra straps to a whole new level. The level where
women worldwide can get the support they need while making their unique
fashionable statements. It’s our belief that freedom of speech can be applied
to even something as simple as bra straps, and GUESS WHAT? IT WORKS! Women, we’re able to reach, are obsessed with our straps, and
we’re aiming to reach plenty more! We’ve been working hard to promote our
brand, nonstop. We’re dedicated entrepreneurs straight out of corporate n
loving it! The fashionable strap glam Hollywood celebrities have had the pleasure of
sporting are now available and truly affordable for the average woman.  Kim Kardashian Jennifer Lopez and Rhianna It gets better, we
promise! Strapstastic bra straps are available in several different
alluring styles. We’ve been told on numerous occasions, they’re all so
fantastic it’s hard choosing just one. What makes Strapstastic more
impressive is the mixing and matching of styles to fit the personality of the
individual! Yes, all the beads are interchangeable and straps are fully adjustable without gluing or sewing! Strapstastic
is also available in standard (1/2”) and Plus (3/4”) sizes. Designed to fit all women. Women can show
their bra straps at work and play, either way people will take notice in a classy way! No, Strapstastic is not your average bra straps.
But, average individuals don’t make memorable statements! Take a look at some
of the styles we have to offer in the rewards section below, we know you’ll
find them impressive as well! ""Strapstastic"" Inventors Hello, Coleman and Jennie here! We’re the inventors of Strapstastic. Our baby’s been in development for 2 years with many trials and errors, but it’s finally launched! It’s enlightening how the
idea for this product came about.  Jennie
and I often go back n' forth reminiscing about it, but as I remember it, back in
2012 my sister came in wearing a top that we noticed had some ""bling"" on
the strap.  She’d bought rhinestones and tried to sew it on herself, but
to make a long story short neither that nor the glue she tried next worked. It
was then the bells went off.  We both
thought, maybe she’s on to something. 
Then perfection when Jennie and I invented ""The Clip"". I remember we
dived right into our project. Started coming up with all these different diagrams
and prototypes, then we came up with working prototypes. Back and forth for
what seemed like an eternity, but we did it! Me, I’ve always considered myself a gadget type of guy,
and Jennie’s more of a fashionista. We’d worked in the corporate world for
many years before deciding to take that leap of faith, and do this. Have you
ever felt unappreciated in your current field? Nobody knows better than us how
fearful a step it can be to just walk away. But, we also felt we were destined
for a greater purpose! As you know, you only get one life to live! Turns out, it’s the best decision we have ever made, in allowing
our entrepreneur spirits to venture out into our handmade Strapstastic product line. Yes, I did say handmade! Jennie and I hand assemble all the
straps personally and consider that entrepreneurship at its best! Plus, we have
a great time doing it! Through the success of this campaign, we’ll also be
spreading the message that anything really is possible!  ""Strapstastic’s"" Success, What the Future Holds Strapstastic have done amazingly well at swap meets and trade shows! They instantly give everyone that WOW effect! We also had the opportunity
to do an online survey for our product. It received a 96% approval rating from women 30 and older in total support. Strapstastic
was launched with Zulily.com about 3 months ago. We received call backs 10 times
during that period. We were more amazed because that just does not happen
with an unknown product and brand!  The on-going support presented us that wow factor! Our accomplishments so far proved Strapstastic is high in demand. This inspired us to turn things up a notch or two. Now, the next big step will introduce Strapstastic to the entire
world through a series of Direct
Response campaigns. That’s where you come in! We’re aiming to reach that
next level of advertisement. The funds raised through this Kickstarter campaign
will be used for TV, Digital Platforms, Social Media, and additional major retail expansion. Our funding goal of $150,000 might seem like a lot for bra straps, but that is what it is going to take for a successful Direct Response campaign. While we’re at it, we also want to show our support to breast cancer awareness through the Susan
G. Komen for the Cure Foundation Orange County. In fact,
our slogan is “Show
Your Straps, Show Your Support!” and we’re donating 5% of every sale to the
foundation. Having lost a mom and 3 aunts to cancer in 2008, we would not have
had it any other way than to SUPPORT in a BIG way! Strapstastic
Backers You help us, and
we reward you in more ways than one! You’ll also have the opportunity to say

My goal is to create a gallery show called NEW BRAIN. It is the most 
important and poignant thing I've ever tried to do.  I'm a 37 year old photographer living in New York City.  Last year I 
experienced multiple seizures and went to the hospital to find out why. A dangerous tumor was discovered and I was rushed in for
 emergency brain surgery to remove it.  It turned out to be brain 
cancer.     To say my life changed would be a huge understatement. All  of a sudden it was all about oncologists, neurologists, social workers, MRI's, chemotherapy, radiation, blood letting, hair losing, pills, paperwork, and major emotional highs and lows. I still can't believe I survived.To deal with the devastating experience I 
documented it all.  I never left the house without two still film 
cameras, a video camera, my journal - I saved and documented everything.
  Staying creative was the only was the only way I could cope.  The 
culmination of all of this material is the show NEW BRAIN. It will be my entire life from November 2010 to November 2011. Large photographs will be hung chronologically around the room. In addition to cancer related pictures and self portraits, there will be images from photo shoots and street photography I took during that time. The walls will be covered with medical paperwork and artifacts. Twenty five old televisions will be showing the videotapes I recorded simultaneously. I hope the show strikes a chord with people. It's not a pity trip but a way to share my work in a new and meaningful way. Thank you so much for your interest and helping me to make this happen.

Our next goal is to take this show abroad, and we will need all the help we can get.  On October 17th 2015, Lincoln Creative Studios will be hosting my photography exhibition in Los Angeles displaying my latest portrait series, “Something In The Way”. My goal is to auction off the pieces and raise $25,000 to donate to the Avon Foundation in the names of all the wives, daughters and mothers who have lost their lives to Breast Cancer. Together with your generous contributions, we can make this show happen! We need to raise the funds to the print and frame of all the portraits. There are a lot of powerful images and we want them to look the absolute best that they can. We are working closely with A and I Photo in North Hollywood, to get museum grade prints for the show in Los Angeles. Something In The Way is a portrait series shot by Sam Sulam in honor of his mother, Rose. The pieces that you help print will be sold at the opening of the exhibit in October and proceeds will be donated to The Avon Foundation Breast Cancer Crusade. With your donation, we can help people who are currently fighting this disease while also helping reach the ultimate goal of a world without breast cancer. The money raised by the show will be managed and disbursed by Avon to help provide access to care for those who most need it, fund educational programs, and accelerate research into new treatments and potential cures.  Selected Portraits:  more atsomethinginthewayproject.com Behind The Scenes Curating Proofs Model Corrie Lejuwaan and Photographer Sam Sulam The Gallery Space: Lincoln Creative Studios in Santa Monica, CA Thank you for your support. The response I received after making this announcement really blew me away. I had people calling me, texting me, emailing me, and messaging me to let their support be known - sometimes friends, sometimes family, and a whole lot from people that I had never met. Individuals from far and wide were reaching out, and all were tied together by a common thread: “This also affects me and I want to help.”  A few months ago I came across a quote that has really stuck with me and I want to share it; “Frankly, there isn’t anyone you couldn’t learn to love, once you've heard their story.” As I opened up about my mother’s passing this year and my desire to use my creative passion to help those in need - I’ve seen so many others begin to open up as well. Whether it’s an illness or any other type of personal suffering, I believe that the simple act of sharing will give others the courage to do the same. ""If I have seen so much, if I have been, since then, so solitary, if my soul has taken such a swirling and solitary movement, if I have doubted everything, if I've been a fatalist, and have been a pessimistic child who awaits death every day, and who almost seeks it out, if I've opened myself slowly and late to happiness, and if I am still a somber man incapable of laughing wholeheartedly, it is because you left me on that road.
But if I have believed in eternal realities, if I have thrust myself toward them, it is also because I was alone, because you were no longer there to be my God, to fill my heart with your abundant and dominating life."" -Andre Trocmé",174.51612903225808,622,20,1.4426666666666668,30.0,6,6,2015,1,1,21,breast cancer,1,0,1,0,0.001607717041800643,0.0,0.3734476641040804,1.4312968993119888,0.0,kickstarter

I knew I wanted to help women with cancer somehow, I just didn't know how. Until one day my friend Tyson was diagnosed with brain cancer, and she was young and strong and had two little boys at home. She told me that there weren't books to help her explain what was happening to her, to her children; all the books out there were for specific cancers, none of them for her.  I set out to create a children's book for mamas with ANY cancer. A book that families could use to talk about cancer with their kids, that they could personalize for their cancer journey. This 40-page hardcover book also has places to put in photos of their child and has ideas for activities to bond Mama with her children during the daunting emotional and physical journey upon them.  Book description: Once upon a time…

It’s how all heroes begin their story, and 
you’re a hero, too! Your mama has cancer, and 
it’s a scary journey, but you can help your mama just by being you—special, wonderful, YOU. 
Your mama loves you just the way you are. 
You are your mama’s knight.

 Mama’s Knight: A Cancer Story of Love is an emotional toolbox 
that can help kids and parents communicate about what it means 
for Mama to have cancer. The book is filled with tools and activities 
designed to make coping with illness easier on both parent and child, and can be personalized for each child.     ""A cancer diagnosis affects the entire family, and discussing it with young children can be difficult in so many ways. Mama's Knight is a delightful, interactive story that will help parents approach this difficult journey in a way that protects their child's emotional health and strengthens their bond along the way."" 
 ""As a counselor, I so appreciate the communication tools Mama's Knight provides families. To be able to communicate with one another about the complicated emotions that go along with cancer will be a blessing to so many. I also loved the superhero helper cards, as they will build an amazing and needed spirit of support within the family."" ""Being a mom can be hard. Being a mom when you have cancer can be more than hard. It can be difficult and scary. I was just adjusting to having two children when my diagnosis threw us all into a tailspin. It was a challenge to find support for mom's with cancer nearby and I wasn't always sure how to speak to my children about the topic. This book, with its cute drawings and easy-to-understand story, helps break down any barriers to explaining cancer to a child. There are so many things cancer does to a person’s body, to their family, and having a resource for ideas to wade through the mess called cancer is a blessing.""  ""The day I found out I had cancer, I was terrified. I knew my outlook was the best anyone could hope for in this situation and I knew I was in very good hands, but there was one thing I didn’t know: How to tell my children. My boys were three and four years old when I was diagnosed. To them, Mommy was a superhero. Suddenly I was sick and I couldn’t do the things we used to do. It was so hard to say I needed to rest on my bad days when all they wanted to do was play and it was even harder to explain why in ways that they could understand. Aurora Whittet managed the impossible in Mama’s Knight, allowing us to have those tough discussions with our young children in a way that not only wasn’t scary, but could make it fun too. This book is a blessing and I hope it finds its way to all the mamas bravely fighting for their knights."" ""Mama's Knight brought tears to my eyes and made my two little boys feel like brave heroes!"" I am joyfully committed to making an impact with Mama’s Knight. I am dedicated to making sure Mama’s Knight finds its way into the hands of mamas who may not otherwise have the resources to purchase a copy. The rewards range from having your name or the name of your child in the book (or the names of family or friends battling cancer in their families), to donating books to families in need. I am using Kickstarter as a platform not only to raise funds, but to expand my reach in the community.   What We Need to Raise The creation of Mama’s Knight has been a labor of love—working with mamas with cancer to learn their needs, and doctors and psychologists to ensure the quality and care of mamas and their children.

This is wild! I love making videos. Last year (before i knew i had cancer), me and my buddy made a couple youtube videos called ""Gardening into the Future"". It is a spoof gardening show about a blind gardener who doesnt know anything about gardening but teaches it like he does. I played The host, Pat Stevens. We filmed our last season in the summer of 2015. Then, in January 2016 i was diagnosed with melanoma in my left eye. My vision in that eye is now severely impaired and unusable. A lot of my favorite activities are now almost impossible to continue. I need to find some new hobbies. All my friends and family love Pat Stevens. So why not start an online store for him. You will still get the same goofy character, but now he makes stuff for sale. His first product will be an eye patch hand made by Pat Stevens himself (me). I would like to make other products too for the vision impaired. Patches are just the start. Patches start at just $10 ($5-$10 to ship). I made a couple prototypes already and is pretty comfortable. This kickstarter will help me refine and make more patches so everyone can enjoy gardening with impaired vision:) There will be an online store attached to my already existing website.

The concept arose from the acutely personal experiences of creative director and artist, Sima Vassilieva, during her own fight with breast cancer. Sima saw herself as an Amazon warrior, one breast removed, firing arrows at multiplying cancer cells from her bow. This mythical image, symbolic of women’s bravery, stoicism and steadfastness in battle, prompted Sima to seek out other Amazons, who had been through the same experience, to help her create an inspirational theatrical performance. Together with Celeste Dandeker-Arnold and Lyudmila Ulitskaya, both breast cancer survivors, the project has grown and evolved to encompass the physical, psychological and spiritual effects of illness as a whole. The performance is divided into three acts, each one embracing a narrative that weaves visual art, costume, choreography and music into a rich fabric of personal experience. Through all these elements we will create a fully immersive multimedia experience. On 28th October, at the Panda Theatre in Berlin, we will stage the first performance of “Amazons in the Tropic of Cancer”. We believe that art plays a cathartic role in every human experience. With this performance, we hope to reach out to all our fellow Amazons as they face life’s battles, but especially those on the battlefield of cancer. 28 октября 2015 года в помещении театра П.А.Н.Д.А. (Берлин) состоится комплексный вечер «Амазонки в Тропике Рака». Он является возможностью познакомить публику с одноимённым проектом, в основу которого положен личный опыт трёх участниц проекта, в борьбе с раком груди. Это писательница Людмила Улицкая, консультант по проекту Селест Дандекер-Арнольд и художница Сима Васильева. Вечер включает в себя литературные чтения Людмилы Улицкой, выставку работ Симы Васильевой, современный танец-перформанс Сони Рошаль с костюмами Юлии Крыловой. Речь пойдёт о том, как каждая женщина по-своему справляется с тяжким путем, который начинается для неё в тот момент, когда она слышит диагноз: «Рак».
В программе П.А.Н.Д.А.-театра, пожалуй, ещё никогда не было такого многостороннего культурного события на столь трагическую, но становящейся всё более и более обыденной, тему.  Говорить публично на такую тему трудно, потому что она касается интимной сферы. Умалчивать — значит стыдиться себя, отрицать своё тело, скрывать свой опыт от тех, кому он необходим, ибо вереница жертв уходит в бесконечность.Мы ищем спонсоров для нашего проекта и будем рады любому содействию.

",2010-09-03 17:51:38,2010-09-16 19:13:24,2010-10-16 19:13:24,15000,True,False,1,266,16136.0,16136.0,USD,USD,1.0,film & video,US,TX,Town,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1559662955/cancerpants-at-the-crossroads-of-life-and-breast-c?ref=category_newest,"STORY:
Fifty people cram into a tiny living room wearing love, strength and fear on their faces. They watch as Rochelle cuts off all of her hair and proceeds to shave her head. In truth, she is shedding her old reality and opening her life and heart to the joy and pain of an uncertain future. This is just one scene in Cancerpants—a story told through the eyes of Rochelle “Ro” Poulson; a story about life, love and a young woman’s journey with breast cancer. Never one to sit still or take her health for granted, Ro maintained a vibrant massage business, ate a vegan diet, practiced yoga regularly and was an avid runner. Life was great. Then, on September 16, 2009, at the age of 36, she was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer, the mass measuring 7 cm. Cancerpants commenced shooting ten days later. After months of chemo, a (failed) lumpectomy, a double mastectomy and radiation, Ro tells the audience, “This isn’t the hardest thing I’ll do in my life.” As friend and filmmaker, I cannot help but wonder, what, then, is? Is Ro super woman, completely delusional or perhaps a little of both? I learn that she is none of the above. “If I have learned anything in my life,” she says, “from being a missionary, a partner, a political activist, to working with Planned Parenthood—it’s that, if you don’t make a lot of noise and tell people you need help then you aren’t going to get your goals accomplished. So, that is just what I am going to do with cancer.” She was a take-charge, get-involved kind of woman before cancer and so that’s who she is with cancer. Despite being poked, prodded and pumped full of the “Red Devil,” Ro remains determined to not allow cancer to dictate her life. During her first chemo treatment, for example, she reads aloud all the possible side effects: “…allergic reactions like skin rash or hives…swelling of the face, lips or tongue…increased risk for infections…bleeding, fever and chills…bruising fainting, breathing problems…mouth sores, nausea…bone pain, complete hair loss, numbness in hands and feet, and weight gain…” “We’ll see about that!” she says, with nervous eyes and shaky grin. In Cancerpants, not only do we follow Rochelle in her daily cancer routine of aches and pains, pills and doctor appointments, we experience in a very real way treatment milestones that inevitably reveal her new life’s plan, rhythms and curiosities. Sit down interviews, whether in her massage studio, kitchen or garden, reveal more than the enduring spirit of a woman, lesbian and cancer patient; they reveal an approach to life that is entertaining and unique; a lesson in how to involve a community in one’s fight and how the power of numbers can help in enduring treatment. With the help of her partner and community, Ro faces each day as it comes, and is grateful for the lessons she learns along the way. Cancerpants shows how the struggles, losses, triumphs and joys of breast cancer affect not only those diagnosed but their family and friends as well. While breast cancer will be a part of Ro’s life for the rest of her life, she doesn’t see cancer as a curse. “I want women to see the value in telling their story,” she says. “And to choose to learn from the experience.” Although there are no finite answers when it comes to cancer, Ro hopes Cancerpants will help in generating awareness and finding a cure.

Made with Stevia!",2013-06-09 02:43:33,2014-07-30 15:28:51,2014-09-28 15:28:51,30000,False,False,0,61,1577.0,1577.0,USD,USD,1.0,food,US,NV,Town,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ecomouse/all-natural-flavored-water-enhancer?ref=category_newest,"SQUISH was born out of necessity! We needed a viable alternative to plain water and tea as the only drink options to those of us who are weening off soda with our meals. Soda is everywhere... it's ubiquitous and the default drink at every restaurant. It's kind of absurd when you think about it. Drinking that much sugar per sitting is unhealthy and we all know it. Drinking that much High Fructose Corn Syrup and food coloring in one sitting is just plain crazy! What are the rest of us left to drink? Some of us actually care about what we put into our bodies. Coffee is fine in moderation, but then there's the dairy factor and the sweetener that's usually added, unless you like it black. And tea is kind of an acquired taste. Most restaurants only serve the bitter black tea, or maybe have a small selection of tea bags available. The more exotic tea blends are expensive and are usually best when made at home anyway. And unless iced, hot tea is just not as refreshing. This brings us to the newer line of flavor water enhancers. (Mio, Dasani Drops etc.) These are great, as they are portable and convenient! They encourage us to drink more water, are slightly healthier than soda or sports drinks. BUT... ...They have several major problems. They contain artificial sweeteners and petroleum based food dyes. (To make them pretty) Aspartame and Acesulfame Potassium (AceK) are two of the most common industrial alternative sweeteners used, and in my opinion the least understood and worse for your body's long term health than a cup of refined sugar. And let's talk about artificial food coloring... IT'S MADE FROM PETROLEUM BY-PRODUCTS!! Yuck!! The only thing ""Food"" about it, is that it's placed in food to make things appear more appetizing. The way it's used in the water enhancers, is that it colors your water so you know what flavor you think your drinking and how strong the flavor might be based on color tint and saturation. But completely unnecessary, and the food coloring by itself doesn't actually have any flavor. So if it wasn't there, grape flavored water would be clear instead of purple. No big deal. Many parents are diligently trying to pull their kids off sweeteners and colorful candies and bright foods. The debate will probably rage on for another 20 years, but as for me and my family, we are living by choice, and living better for the choices we make. SQUISH is perfect for those of us who are engaged in active lifestyles. The small portable squeeze bottles are convenient and help deliver the right portion without spillage. You control the flow of flavor! The flavor of SQUISH is unique, bright, tangy and sweet. I would describe it as being an in-between of lemonade and fresh lemon water. The Stevia we use is the purest form, and is known as honey leaf. It doesn't have that weird aftertaste that some people who are generally turned off of Stevia by. It turns out, the aftertaste or even the front bitter taste comes from inferior Stevia, and the fillers used to ""cut"" down the extract. Ours is 95%+ pure Rebaudioside. (The sweet part of the Stevia plant) Our producer removes all the stems and root parts (bitter) and only uses the A grade leaves, that are hand picked, not mechanically separated. SQUISH uses only 5 ingredients. They are sourced from the best producers. SQUISH is Non-GMO, Vegan friendly, Diabetic Safe and can even get a Kosher certification. I'm using the highest concentration and purest form stevia extract available, without any fillers or byproducts. Certified organic, cold pressed Lemon Oil. High Alkaline Water and 100% pure food grade Citric Acid. When I first developed SQUISH I was able to crack the code of how to get oil and water to mix, and stay mixed. Have extended (non-refrigerated) shelf life and still be tasty! I've been making it for a couple of years now just for myself, and to give out to friends. The feedback has been amazing! I even have a person who says they generally hate lemon flavored anything, and they even liked it! I've given it to diabetic friends, who were leery at first, and ready for something to happen after drinking water flavored with SQUISH. And nothing happened! SQUISH has been a hit with everyone who's tried it. And the most common feedback I've received is that no one can figure out why this hasn't been thought of before, or why Coke and Pepsi haven't figured this out yet? (I know the reason, but it boils down to money and existing supply chain) SQUISH gets used everyday by myself and my friends. I personally like adding SQUISH to my Kleen Kanteen iced water when I go for a long bike ride or workout. It's the right amount of sweet and I stay hydrated, because it tastes so good. (I prefer to use re-usable stainless instead of plastic bottles)  Another good place to use SQUISH is at a restaurant to add to the table water they bring you. No asking for lemons, then extra lemons, and then finally nailing your eating companion in the eye with lemon juice. And it can be SQUISHED discreetly if you wish. Our latest favorite use of SQUISH has been mixing with seltzer water or club soda for a refreshing fizzy drink over ice! I've already been messing with new flavors. Right now at launch Lemony Zing and Orange You Glad are the two flavors I'm most satisfied with. There will be a couple more citrusy flavors down the road. I'm messing with Grapefruit, Lime and Tangerine Oils at the moment. So there's a lot of potential for singular flavors or their combinations. The traditional Lemon/Lime paring will be explored too. For the first round of SQUISH I'm only focusing within the citrus family. Main reason is shelf life and flavor compatibility with citric acid. Between those two ingredients I've left a large container of SQUISH open on the counter for 2 weeks and had zero bacterial growth, and the batch was still tasty. What about other flavors, like cherry? Well... it's a possibility. There are some fruit essences and oils that do taste pretty good in concentrate. But not all. Then there is the expectant flavor psychology that isn't going to be present with all-natural products. Cherry ""flavor"" has a distinct flavor that everyone knows and expects what it should taste like. But if we were to use real cherry extract, it might be very tart and taste like eating real cherries. As good as that could sound, it might be a disaster for a refreshing flavor water enhancer. I would like to maybe one day have a vanilla water. I've experimented with that a bit over the years, and it has huge potential. Money raised through Kickstarter will be used directly for launching SQUISH into production. We need bottle and cap molds. Cap molds are the most expensive, though we may be able to use a pre-existing cap. We will need shrink labels, and a heat tunnel to set them. Although not a necessity, as a heat gun will work in a pinch. The other production items will be a large double wall 40 gallon kettle boiler, and electronic fluid dispensing machines. As you can see, branding is already done. However, countertop display boxes will need to be manufactured if we have any hopes of seeing these on store shelves, even Whole Foods requires display packaging. The second largest expense is the stevia extract. One has to purchase it by the kilo and you pay a premium for it's purity and not have it cut with fillers or byproducts. (Wait... that sounds like something else I've heard of ;-) Then there is the large quantities of organic Lemon Oil. Turns out, in large casks Lemon Oil has to ship by truck because it's considered highly flammable. (Duh, it's an oil) Thus adding to the expense. SQUISH is a great product that needs to be in people's hands. We all need to drink plenty of water, but no one needs to drink artificial sweeteners and chemical colorants!

- A photographic tale of cancer survival When I was diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic
Colon Cancer in August 2016, I began a year-long program of aggressive
chemotherapy treatment, through which I was lucky to experience little in the
way of traditional side effects, apart from one - a severe hyper sensitivity to
the sun – which put real limitations on my award-winning landscape photography
pursuits.  So, I looked for opportunities to shoot new
scenes from the protective shade of my car and it turned out wildlife was it… Indeed,
every wildlife shot I have created since September 2016 was shot Through the
Window of my car. I’ve transformed my new Colorado wildlife
portfolio – birdlife, bison, badgers and burrowing owls – into a compelling photographic
journey through my year-long triumph over cancer, filled with mini anecdotes of
the new challenges I overcame to combine my passion for photography with a
‘survivor’ mindset.   The Through
the Window book is the centerpiece of a new cancer awareness and support community
for artists and art lovers alike.   Awareness and early detection of Colon
Cancer, indeed any cancer, are critical. My own battle to overcome the disease
has sparked a real commitment to the Colon Cancer Alliance of which I am now a
proud champion and the reason I have produced the book.  As a believer that mindset helps stimulate
recovery, If Through the Window helps even one cancer sufferer to
brighten up their own journey or accelerates one piece of research or awareness
by just a fraction of one per cent, then I will live a happy man! The $7,500 Kickstarter funding target is limited
to the up-front investment required to print Through the Window and produce postcard gifts
and prints from the book.     ",92.95901639344262,296,8,1.5121333333333333,30.0,9,6,2017,1,1,21,colon cancer,1,1,1,1,0.0033783783783783786,0.0033783783783783786,0.6640271493212669,7.313642840284433,2.0,kickstarter

The leftover profits will be going on to other projects to fund other programs.  How do we plan to accomplish this? As mentioned in the video, Buildbox is a powerful game building software for individuals that have little to no coding experience. It's a highly versatile, easy to use engine. Through hard work and dedication this game will be built.  When will this be ready? As soon as possible. We're aiming to make this a quality game. Various levels, enemies, bosses, powerups, the whole nine yards. Essentially this project will be considered a full time job along with the regular 9-5. I estimate a few months till project completion due. Why try such a venture? Why not? This is a venue to help lend a hand to children. By actively donation profits to research, we hope to save lives. Which is quite possible by exploiting the fact that people love mobile games, and not necessarily pay mind to cancer research issues.  What will the funds go to? The funds will be going to the Buildbox Software, then the rewards system. After this funds will be attributed to hiring a professional animator, and fees for getting into the app markets. All left over funds then will be used for marketing the game to gain traction so that way funds can be developed for the cancer research.  Incentive Competition! https://www.facebook.com/OutsetDevelopment Check our page out to get into the action!",0.0,291,24,0.0,17.0,6,1,2015,1,1,15,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

You can have a part in creating this epic mythology about the cancer journey.  When we finish the illustrations,  you'll get a digital edition of the comic book that you can read on any electronic device, and a lot more.     We have 80 pages already drawn and colored, so we're about half way finished with the book.  It's very time consuming and without funding, this project might take years to complete.  We'd like to finish it this year.     For most levels you pledge at, we'll send you some cool stuff, and we'll send some cool stuff to someone with cancer.  For the higher pledge levels, we'll send a gift box to a cancer center of your choice - or we'll pick one from our growing list.  We'll be posting the names and locations of the cancer centers we donate to, in our backer blog. Follow along - it'll be fun! _____________________________________________________________     She's joined by her pet kitty, Iceman, as they set out to destroy the Tumordome, the invading cancer cell army, and their leader - the little dictator that's bent on world domination. But they don't do it alone - they make friends with a rag-tag bunch of weakened immune system cells that are on their last leg.  Hilarity and butt-kicking will ensue.  You won't believe what we have in store!!!  WHAT DO OTHER CANCER PATIENTS THINK OF IT SO FAR?     Last year, we published our first comic with the help of Kickstarter.com and we've donated copies to cancer patients all over the world with lots of enthusiastic feedback - people love it!  But the book isn't for everyone. Our humor is sometimes dark and we aim for complete honesty - giving you both the raw emotion of a cancer diagnosis, and the ridiculously humorous situations a cancer patient goes through.      Each year over 72,000 young adults are diagnosed with cancer in the US-- that's one new diagnosis every eight minutes. There's an obvious lack of literature (and humor!) catering to cancer patients-- especially young adults. ""Terminally Illin"" is filling this specific niche in the cancer community, and our budding fan base is eagerly awaiting the rest of the story. ______________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________     It will take approximately 6 months to complete the book.  Each scene requires a lot of research to bring it alive, and each page can take 20 - 30 hours to layout, illustrate, and color.  Based on what we completed last year, we estimate it will take 2,500+ hours to complete the 80+ pages remaining of our graphic novel.  We're under-budgeting our Kickstarter project, as the book is a labor of love. We set our project goal at the minimum amount needed to maintain an intense focus for about 4 - 5 months.  In September 2012, a documentary series about this comic is set to air (details tba!), and our publication will coincide with this date. We're excited to get this finished & out into the world! ______________________________________________________________     We've already got the screens made and ready to crank out our cool new designs.  Once we're funded, we'll start shipping stuff out within 3 to 5 weeks.   We learned from our last Kickstarter how to get a system in place to make it easy - even when offering several different options. ______________________________________________________________ Thank you for your time and consideration in becoming a backer.

MARIA MY LOVE is about a 22 year-old woman who, in an effort to recover from the death of her mother to cancer, sets out on a quest to help people but winds up encountering situations more emotionally and morally complicated than she had expected to find. The money we raise on KickStarter will go toward equipment. If we exceed our goal, any additional money will be an enormous help in supporting the making of MARIA MY LOVE.

I[2]Y strives to be a national leader in cancer advocacy, support and research, working exclusively on behalf of adolescents and young adults affected by cancer. FILM SYNOPSIS: 24-year old Lauren is working as a waitress in Brooklyn, waiting to figure out what she wants out of life. Once upon a time she aspired to be a performer, but her passions were put on hold when she spent a year in the hospital caring for her dying mother. Now it’s the one-year anniversary of her mother’s death, and, instead of dealing with the loss, Lauren throws herself into a relationship with an attractive out-of-work poet named Brian. Lauren's looking for a distraction; Brian's looking for love. The two are swept up into a whirlwind romance. While Brian proves instrumental in helping Lauren heal, she becomes convinced she is meant to help another human being. What seems like a noble quest, however, causes friction with a reality more complicated than Lauren's ideals allow. Lauren meets a woman with the same name as her mother—Maria—and thinks she’s finally found the person she was meant to help. But when she discovers the woman is a compulsive hoarder who seems to be gradually loosing touch with the world outside her apartment, the challenge of helping her becomes more difficult than she ever imagined. MARIA MY LOVE is a portrait of a woman in mourning and a study of loss— how it informs everyday interactions and permeates the lives of those left behind. It is a story about reconnection and recovery, about the small things people do to help each other, and the big dreams that sometimes run afoul of the real world. The film is inspired by true events—actress Lauren Fales lost her mother to cancer at 21 and has been dealing with the loss ever since. MARIA MY LOVE is dedicated to Lauren’s mother, and to everyone who has lost a parent and found a way to continue living.

The finished canvasses will be suitable for display individually or as a set. I truly hope the vibrant, uplifting colors will inspire you to help bring this project to fruition!

My name is Sophia and I'm an architecture student who’s in my free time voluntarily working to improve a children's cancer clinic in Stockholm. I'm currently working with the preparation room where the child and their family first encounter the cancer diagnosis and are prepared for the treatment. It is in other words a space that the child will be referring to during a long period of time, but despite its importance the budget for this room is basically nonexistent. Today the children's preparation room doesn't in any way look like a room for children. When I was first introduced to it I was happy when I finally found something that was child friendly - a doll - but I was quickly disappointed when I was informed that even this had a preparation function - to show the child how needles are used. Today the room is, apart from the machines and instruments that the child will meet, empty and cold looking, doing the exact opposite of what it is supposed to - to ease the meeting with the unfamiliar and scary looking instruments. My hope is to get the possibility to create a preparation room that makes the child feel safe and makes the experience with cancer easier, as for its parents, siblings and other family members. Below are some before and after pictures of the recent space that I designed, the medical expedition. The function of this room and aim with the redesign of it was a whole other than for the preparation room, but I think that many of the additions could be useful in the preparation room as well. The main problem with the medical expedition was that it was very noisy why fore I added textiles such as soft furniture and curtains to absorb sound. These even contributed to a more calm, relaxed and homely atmosphere, which I am wishing for the children's preparation room. Your contribution, even just the sharing of this, will mean a lot.

I was on my lunch break at work when I received a call informing me that I had breast cancer. Since that day, I walk around in the world disguised as Sharon. The eyes I see with belong to someone I do not know, and my body is a foreign puzzle with missing pieces. Every day I am newly surprised by the decimation of what my life once was. Nine months, two surgeries, 16 chemotherapy treatments, and one broken heart later, I am now ready to make sense of this journey. My vision is to choreograph an evening-length dance piece that transforms the way we think about change in our lives. In the past months I have struggled with the fact that there is no such thing as certainty, and that death is a tangible and inescapable presence. There are times I am successful in coming to terms with this truth, and I find joy through groundlessness—letting go and surrendering. There are other times, however, when I hold on too tightly, refusing to pry my fingers open lest I transition, floating, into nothingness. Through The Materiality of Impermanence I seek to express the ravages of breast cancer, and at the same time, manifest the beauty and strength of the human spirit. Using contemporary movement language, the piece will be structured as a series of solos, duets, trios, and group sections, and will include nine performers, aerial dance, music (including a live harp), text and video. The total cost of the project is approximately $23,000, which covers theater rental for six shows, lighting, set, video, and costume design, and performer and technical crew fees. The funds raised on Kick Starter will be used to pay for the deposit on the theater space. Remaining production costs will be covered through grants, ticket sales, and in-kind donations. Once the theater deposit has been paid, I will approach various cancer non-profit organizations to form a partnership—they will market the project to their donor base in exchange for the opportunity to raise awareness about breast cancer through the arts. Proceeds from the performances will be donated to the partner charities. A new friend recently asked me two questions: ""What is your greatest fear?” and ""What is your greatest hope?""

Each episode will feature him going through one of the stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance) and how it affects the people he loves including his friends, family, co-workers. In Season Two, Will finds out the lump was cancer and now he has tough choices to make about his treatment. He also has to cope with the reality that even though he had a testicle removed, there's always the chance the cancer will return.  I started financing the series myself, but need your help to finish. Funds will to go renting of cameras, lights, microphones, paying and feeding cast and crew, location and union fees, insurance, editing, effects, color correction, and promotional costs.  I'm trying to turn this life challenge into a positive creative experience for me and raise some testicular cancer awareness along the way.

It was, as cancer always is, unexpected and terrifying.  

Many people have had their lives touched by cancer, felt the weight of the diagnosis, and simultaneously been at a loss for how to show their support. When my father was diagnosed I chose to fight the sense of helplessness by turning to healthy food. Hours in the kitchen gave birth to a recipe blog at ChemoBites.com. My dad’s request for snacks, sometimes all he could eat due to the side effects of chemotherapy, lead to elaborate boxes of tasty treats. These boxes evolved to become my featured product: Chemo Bites Snack Boxes. My hope is to empower others to support their loved ones journey from cancer to wellness. Gifts of healthy snacks and whole foods recipes are helping my father; I know they will support others as well. Read more about the story on Komo News. Chemo Bites Snack Boxes are artfully presented gift boxes filled with hand-selected, nutritious and palatable snacks for people fighting cancer and those in remission hoping to maintain a healthy lifestyle and stay cancer-free. Chemo Bite Snack Boxes give caregivers, family and friends an easy way to help their loved ones, simultaneously fulfilling their own emotional need to provide practical, effective support in the fight against cancer. Our smart snack options are delivered to patients’ homes, or to the hospital so that they can focus on healing. It’s a welcome and practical gift for patients staying in the hospital since flowers are not allowed in oncology wings.  Snack Boxes are filled with nutritional, fun snacking options for people fighting cancer and survivors in remission wanting to maintain healthy habits.  Our ""bite size"" snack box contains five full sized snack items. We carefully select snacks from brands that share our values and love of good food. Chemo Bites offer boxes on a 3- and 6-month subscription basis where each month the box delivered to the patient’s home will include new items.  Snack Boxes can be purchased online by patients or as gifts by caregivers, friends and family and are available on a one-time basis or a subscription basis. When purchased as a gift, the buyer can request us to include a hand-written note to the recipient.  They can also be purchased in bulk for resale and a co-branding program is being developed.

promoted and prescribed as a complimentary treatment to today’s standard
practice of focusing predominately on chemotherapy and radiation. While chemo
and radiation can destroy cancer cells, they do not make a patient healthy.
Whole foods and a healthy lifestyle are the cornerstone to recovery. Chemo
Bites wants to see nutritionists working alongside oncologists to develop
comprehensive treatment plans for cancer patients.  Product Expansion: We are currently product testing and conducting
market research on snack boxes tailored to different dietary and life-style
needs, including kid-friendly, gluten-free, and vegan. Product
expansion will also include offering larger boxes of snacks for those with
insatiable appetites and an option for more frequent delivery if buying on a
subscription basis. Chemo Bites is preparing to roll out customized boxes that
are created on a one-by-one basis for customers with discerning taste and specialized
dietary needs, available at a higher price-point as a customized service. Co-branding: Chemo Bites is developing a co-branding initiative
with hospitals and treatment centers to ramp up distribution opportunities. In
partnership, snack boxes will be co-branded as a product of Chemo Bites and the
healthcare partner. The partner will then be able to purchase in bulk and then
either give to patients in their programs or resell through their gift
shops.  Buy in bulk: Should a recipient of a snack box fall in love with
a particular snack, Chemo Bites will soon give them the option of purchasing the
item in bulk from our online store.  Retail locations: Chemo Bites will be available for off-line purchase
at a limited number of locations by January 2014. Brick and mortar retail
locations will include hospital and treatment center gift shops. Cookbook: Since Chemo Bites started as a recipe blog, I want to compile our carefully crafted recipes
into a digital cookbook to reach more people with the important message of
incorporating a healthy diet into one’s cancer treatment regime. Giving Back: We’ll soon be adding a feature to the site that
allows people to purchase a snack box at a deep discount to be gifted to newly
diagnosed patients at hospitals throughout Southern California, where we are
headquartered. Additionally, Chemo Bites is now forging partnerships with
national organizations to position our self as a sponsor of nutritional awareness
through nationwide fundraising events. Nationwide, there were 1.6 million new cases of cancer diagnosed in 2013 and 13.7 million cancer survivors in remission, all whom can benefit from good nutrition. Chemo Bites
launched in Southern California and serves three communities through out the
region: (1) patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy and other courses of
treatment (2) people in remission from cancer and (3) caregivers (friends and
family) of the previous two. In the Los Angeles area alone they are 13
hospitals that are nationally ranked for their oncology programs. Patients
receiving treatment for cancer come from around the world to be treated at
Southern California medical centers and the doctors and researchers rank among
the top in the oncology field. In California there were 171,000 new cases of
cancer reported in 2013 and 1.6 million survivors currently in remission My hometown
of Seattle, Washington, is on the forefront of cancer research and care. While
headquartered in Southern California, Chemo Bites is building strategic
relationships with organizations, research centers and hospitals in the Seattle
area to poise ourselves for a successful launch into the Seattle market. Chemo Bites,
as an online retailer, intends to expand to other major urban areas, those with
renowned cancer research and treatment facilities, with public launch events

I need to raise $9500 for this show, which may seem like an awful lot, but it is really just the bare essence of the production.  About Eighteen Months: Much has been written for women by women on the subject of breast cancer. Yet, there is little that has been written for the theatre, specifically from a man’s personal perspective.  ""Eighteen Months"" has been adapted as a full-length one-act stage play, based upon my original published book, Eighteen Months – A Love Story Interrupted. It is not a work of fiction. The characters are real people and the content is true to its original intentions.

 The story takes place in and around a major urban centre. The two characters are Charlie (early 50s) and Sharon (middle 40s) who meet and begin a relationship lasting a mere eighteen months.

Together they complete a daunting journey touched by humour, compassion, fear, support, anger and utter frustration. Most of all, this is a love story, culminating in a death and many unanswered questions.

 Eighteen Months is also a story of a human relationship that testifies to the strength and will of both the terminally ill patient, Sharon, and her partner, Charlie, as he comes to accept her illness and the short period they spend together.

 As the story progresses, Charlie reacts to Sharon’s illness as best he can in his own way and openly expresses to the audience his shortcomings and frustrations. His response to life’s uncertainties in the shadow of Sharon’s approaching death mirrors the worst fears of each of us. We observe Sharon’s physical condition gradually deteriorate, but not her determination to achieve her dreams, nor her concern and love for Charlie.

 Narrated by Charlie, the events of this powerful stage play continue to unfold today in many people’s lives. It sheds light on a man’s emotional pain and turmoil as he lives through the tragedy of losing his partner to breast cancer.
 Purpose of raising funds through Kickstarter: - To support the creation
 of an original work for the theatre. Objectives:  - My primary
objective is to reveal and share with the audience Charlie’s deep emotions and
tragedy in losing his partner to breast cancer and the many soul-searching
questions her death forces him to confront. Charlie’s struggle encourages the
audience to question, clarify, deepen and extend their understanding of human
behaviour.  - To develop the work into a full-length one-act play of the pre-existing script for the intention of production. - To run a pilot project of one show and to evaluate the project afterwards to plan for long-term implementation.
 - To present a fully staged play at the end of the pilot project
. Strategies: - Seek out a dramaturge and two actors who are willing to engage in the development process of the 
work, providing feedback and suggestions to make a viable long-term presence for the playwright in the theatre community.
 - Seek a partnership with a theatre or rehearsal room or similar, for donated rehearsal space. Eligible costs: The main purpose of raising funds through Kickstarter is to provide 
 eligible expenses for:   - Dramaturgy fees
 - Costs related to readings and workshops

I know how scary this conversation is as I discussed my breast cancer diagnosis with my daughters eleven years ago when they were 9 and 13. Having a resource like Maggie Lives with Breast Cancer A Family Tale of New Beginnings to read with my children would have eased some of our fears as a family. Maggie Lives with Breast cancer was written to help guide families in communicating their breast cancer diagnosis.

With the help of your contributions, we can reach our Mission to a Million. One million cancer patients, that is. One Veda is launching with a line of seven skin, hair and nail products, in seven different scents. For every product we sell, one will be donated to a patient undergoing treatment for cancer. Our mission as a new company is to give products to one million cancer patients in our first year of business, and the goal of our Kickstarter Campaign is to get us started toward that goal!  Every pledge to our campaign will reward both a backer and a cancer patient with all-natural, quality skincare products -- bringing us closer to reaching one million patients. We are ready to hit the ground running. Our goal of $10,000 will help purchase supplies and fund production and sales of our products. More products and more sales will enable us to grow and reach more customers and patients.  Our Kickstarter funds will also allow us to set up an e-commerce solution to handle our direct-to-consumer online sales; as well as manage our database of cancer patients requesting product. This means we can extend our reach nationally -- and even globally -- in addition to our local footholds in the Boston and New York markets. While One Veda is not a non-profit, our business model is built on passion and purpose. Our primary goal at One Veda is to help people: cancer patients; their caregivers and families; the partners of One Veda and their families; and people of any ethnicity and skin type who appreciate natural skin and hair products and want to do good for our planet and the people living on it.  For cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, there are few non-chemical solutions for the uncomfortable skin, hair and nail issues that arise from these harsh treatments. The purpose of One Veda is to provide these people with comfort and relief in the form of all-natural skin care products, which utilize fair trade moisturizers and the healing power of aromatherapy. For every One Veda product purchased, one will be donated to someone undergoing treatment for cancer. *One Veda's hand cream and body lotion are the only products that require a small amount of preservative, due to their high water content When Jason Carpenter, a journalist by trade, started treatment after being diagnosed in 2007 with multiple myeloma (commonly known as bone marrow cancer), he began experiencing painful skin, nail and hair disorders almost immediately. He found that there were no clear-cut answers when it came to balms and skin care products to alleviate his discomfort—and certainly no all-natural solutions.

 After discussions with fellow chemo patients at the hospital, Jason began testing Shea butter on his ravaged skin, and using the principles of aromatherapy to help address the nausea, dizziness and inherent sour stomach brought on by the chemicals used for treatment.   He began mixing products at home, customizing his own scents, and when he gave them to friends at the chemotherapy clinic, Jason found that the products worked exceedingly well. He concluded that if these lotions, salves and soaps worked well on the immensely damaged bodies of cancer patients, they would also benefit anyone who uses them. Hence, the One Veda line of products, philosophy, vision and passion were born. At One Veda, our team is family. We are a group of seven like-minded partners and friends who have all been directly touched by cancer. Stay tuned for detailed profiles on each partner throughout our campaign!  (from left to right) 

  All of our products contain Shea butter, a fat extracted from the African Shea nut which has been used for centuries on skin, hair and nails. Additionally, all of our pure Shea butter is purchased fair trade, directly from those who harvest it in Africa. We use several different natural oils known for their skin-nourishing properties, including avocado oil, argan oil, olive oil, vitamin E, among others. Additionally, we only use pure essential oils and pthalate-free fragrance oils to scent our products. Jason mixes these oils to create custom scents that also serve holistic purposes.

Combining Shea butter with the principles of aromatherapy creates a unique product that addresses the problems cancer patients face every day when going through chemotherapy and other treatments.  We have everything in place to establish One Veda as a company -- finalized products, design, etc. However, we need a few more things before we can reach one million cancer patients:",90.28947368421052,788,34,1.0293,30.0,5,4,2015,1,1,18,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

I also lost a grandmother to cervical cancer and an aunt to Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.  My wife's family lost a 7-year-old boy to Neuroblastoma.  Needless to say, cancer has impacted our lives in a significant way.  I wanted to do something for a long time, but I wasn’t sure what I could do that would make an impact.  Then I tried to buy a shirt with a liver cancer message to remember my mom, and I couldn’t find one that I liked.  I looked some more and discovered that there are not a lot of options for cancer awareness shirts for people with less prevalent types of cancer.  We created our first three designs and put them on the web.  There was an immediate, positive response and Fight Cancer Shirts.com was born. From the beginning, we have donated 10% of our profits to cancer research.  We now have about twenty five designs and are pushing the limits of our current operations capabilities.  We are expanding our existing business in several ways.   1) We will have a custom website built, which will allow us much more flexibility in what we can offer our customers.  This will include adding a Loyalty Program, more different types of discounts, more designs and many more choices of colors and styles. 2) We are upgrading our operations facility which will allow us to keep more inventory on hand, streamline our process (both of which will help your order get to your door faster) and create more detailed designs than we can currently offer by adding new printing capabilities. 3) The rewards & shipping charges for this Kickstarter (KS) Campaign along with credit card processing fees, KS fees and taxes have been calculated into this plan.  We can't wait to deliver it!   We have already met with a web developer and have a plan in place as well as a price quote for what it will take to make the changes that are needed.  We have also priced out all of the operational equipment we need to upgrade our facility.  These changes will allow us to keep up with our increasing number of orders, while maintaining our very personal level of customer service and support.   The development process will take 16 weeks once funds are raised.

In light of recent events in Egypt, Libya, Bahrain, Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, as a global society, we are once again reminded that military juntas and purist idealogues look for excuses to impose rules that keep them in power without due process of law. These plays and poems by Nobel Laureate, Harold Pinter, nail these problems and their creators to the wall with precise and biting wit and humor. We want to produce these obscure and politically-charged works because, not only are these lesser-known works by a major playwright, but also we are concerned that these issues are still largely ignored, until dramatic events occur. The everyday torture and suppression of free speech go largely unseen and unheard. Cancer Cells opens on April 29, 2011 and runs until May 22, 2011, every Friday and Saturday at 8 pm and Sundays at 2 pm at The Garage, 975 Howard Street in San Francisco. Rehearsals started March 22nd and are going amazingly well. The intensity of the works and the topic has a attracted a talented and dedicated team of actors and technicians. There are little moments of ""shock and awe"" throughout the rehearsals. We are working to build those to even greater heights. These seldom performed works, never before assembled on the same evening, draw from such poems as “American Football”, “Death” and “Cancer Cells”, the title piece. Also on the bill is Mr. Pinter's first overtly political one-act play One for the Road (1984), Mountain Language (1988), concerned with Turkish suppression of the Kurdish language, and Gulf War-influenced The New World Order (1991). This new string of fiery works linked by the apparent ""invulnerability of power"" combine with another short sketch and various poetic selections of Mr. Pinter's to manifest a chillingly honest, uninhibited look into his world and mind.  PUS (Performers Under Stress, http://pustheatre.com) Artistic Director, Scott Baker, and Artistic Associate, Geoff Bangs (who conceived the project) together helm this production which displays Pinter’s insight into the whims of military power as they grow out of control and finally silence the life of the mind, like a cancer that destroys from within.  We've already raised the initial funds we need to start rehearsal. We're looking for help paying royalties to the Pinter Estate, as well as honorariums for the actors. Set, props and costumes, though not expensive, are needs as well. We've set a minimum of $1,100 but could really use closer to $3,000 to fund this production. Please give what you can. Who's Harold Pinter?  Harold Pinter was an English playwright, screenwriter, actor, theatre director, left wing political activist and poet. As a student of Samuel Beckett, Pinter became one of the most influential British playwrights of modern times. His awards include a Tony Award for his 1967 play, The Homecoming, as well as the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005. Pinter shared his entire life through writing, from his battle with cancer to his political activism. ",45.407407407407405,520,24,1.1145454545454545,48.90725694444444,4,0,2011,1,1,23,general,1,0,1,0,0.0019230769230769232,0.0,0.9845758354755784,6.9495154802086,0.0,kickstarter

Because cell phone towers are very far away, phones have to send very strong signals to communicate.  But is cell phone radiation dangerous? Many studies have now linked cell phone radiation with cancer. Some have indicated it causes DNA damage. Most recently in 2016, early results were released from a large rat study conducted by the US National Toxicology Program (NTP), showing an increased rate of certain brain (glioma) and heart (schwannoma) cancers in rats. The scary part is, the same types of tumors have been found in humans exposed to cell phone radiation. In the words of Scientific American, the respected and storied science magazine: ""Three case-control [human] studies conducted since 2010 have all been positive (an increase in gliomas were found) in the highest exposure groups. Two studies found that the tumors occurred on the same side as phone use. . . .  In our opinion, the exposure to RF-EMF caused the tumors seen in the male rats in the NTP study. With the positive case-control studies seen in humans and a similar positive finding in a well-conducted laboratory study in rats, the evidence that cell phones can cause cancer has strengthened. Do we think cellphones cause cancer in humans? Probably."" This troubling research inspired our team to create a premium leather phone case that could block RF (radio-frequency) radiation while being attractive and easy to use. Reputable organizations and studies are questioning the safety of cell phone radiation. Why continue being exposed by your unshielded cell phone case, when protection is this easy? Our shielding system works on the same principle as a Faraday Cage, using highly conductive materials to reflect radiative signals away from your body harmlessly. But our cases feature radiation shielding only in the front cover, which protects the user holding the phone to their head, while still allowing the device to communicate. This means optimum convenience combined with shielding that's backed by physics. Because the shielding is so essential to our product, we've also conducted internal tests with cellular-frequency testing equipment to ensure the shielding is effective.   The case also protects you while in your pocket! Simply ensure the shielded front side of the case is facing inward, against your body. Head protection is the most essential, but because cell phone radiation follows an inverse square law, the danger is greatest when the phone is closest to you. Our case offers protection at all of these times. The cases include many other handy features, such as Staying protected has never been so easy! For the price of a night out, you get peace of mind about radiation AND protection for your phone, all in an attractive leather package. You don't need to wear a tinfoil hat to be concerned about cell phone radiation. Stop taking an unnecessary risk, and help us with our dream to protect the world's 4.5 billion cell phone users! We're excited to deliver you a stylish case with built-in peace of mind. --- Whether you're a backer or not, it helps immensely if you leave a nice comment here, follow us on Instagram or Twitter, or share to help us reach our funding goal!

cancer play.  Sarah & The Dinosaur is an unorthodox, funny, heartbreaking, and honest narrative of one
woman and her journey with cancer. In Sarah's world, this cancer has come to her in the form of a Dinosaur. It doesn't look like Barney. It follows her everywhere. It feels guilty. It wants to leave, but it is so hungry.  Through all of this, Sarah fights her Dinosaur and struggles to make peace with what it means to live with terminal cancer.  Woven
into the play are original writings from Sarah’s
blog, [Love X Infinity]2 where she chronicles her life with ocular melanoma. 
This is the story of her sometimes quirky, sometimes poignant, always courageous,
soulful fight with cancer. We are
scheduled to premiere Sarah & The Dinosaur in March of 2012 at the Lee Eshleman Studio Theater at Eastern Mennonite University in Harrisonburg, VA. This is our
invitation to you to help support this production. We hope you
are inspired to share this journey with us. Your financial
support will help to cover a part of the cost for:

I understand that world and I've witnessed first hand how the process of going through treatment could be greatly improved. I have complete empathy for those who have to go through it, those who have gone through it and those contemplating prophylactic measures.  The challenge for me during treatment was to improve the conversation around the reconstruction of my body. I was going to lose my breasts, which was something that was never on my radar. When women have mastectomies, they lose their nipples as well. Talking about the surgical direction with hand gestures, photo examples showing the results on other women's bodies, or 3-D graphic illustrations of an average female form was fine at the time while I was trying to comprehend having cancer, but in the back of my mind, I still felt that I was in the dark about what I was going to actually look like in the end. I knew that I would have scars but I wasn't sure how many or how big they would be. I wanted to see visual references of future results on my own body and wondered why something like this wasn't already in place in the age of technology and digital photography. Background. In the world of advertising, before a creative agency can sell a commercial, they must show the client with frame by frame references what their commercial is going to look like so that they know what the creative agency will be producing. From camera angle, to the style of lighting, to what the actors are wearing, how their product will be featured, even the style of the actors hair and so on. There are many subtleties in the aesthetic choices that go into the creation of a commercial and as a creative professional, you have to represent everything that you plan to create visually to your client because they may have something completely different in their mind. You have to be on the same page with your client because they are the ones paying for the commercial. This is called Previsualization, and in the advertising and film business it's called a Pre-viz.  Previsualizing a commercial staves off any future disappointment and puts you on the same page with your client. Happy client. Happy business, right? If I were ever to explain a commercial to a client with hand gestures or pictures of another commercial that's similar, I know for a fact that I would not get the job.  That's how I treated the reconstruction of my body. I imported the idea of previsualization into the world of Breast Cancer reconstruction. I wanted to know what I was going to look like during and after several months of surgeries. Even though I had a very talented plastic surgeon, I still needed a visual references for myself that represented my own body. This helped me to keep my expectations in check and cross reference with my doctor about the surgical goals.  My campaign is two pronged. First, women don't know that they can ask for this type of service because it has never been offered before, and to be honest, ridding oneself of cancer is always the primary haunting concern. Most of us think: if I make it out of here alive, I will be grateful. New boobs and a tummy tuck can be viewed as perk, but being free from cancer is the goal.  I will generate an Awareness Campaign in tandem to the launch of the beta test for my Breast Cancer Previsualization App. I want women to know that they need to ask for this type of service and to raise the question, Why isn't something like this in place already?  My Breast Cancer Previsualization App is a tool that will allow women to view the surgical plan on their own body while sharing the same perspective as their surgeon. And this too puts them both on the same page.  Every Breast Cancer diagnosis and every surgical procedure is different. Just as every woman’s body type is different and how they'll heal is different. There are many variations of results.  Raising awareness is paramount to the launch of this app because currently, the norm is that women go into surgery with very little information. They go into surgery in the dark, holding onto the belief in their doctor's skill set, that they will come out like one of their best case scenarios. I was quite fortunate to have excellent results as I have seen far too many horrific results in private Breast Cancer community chat forums that were just completely heartbreaking. I consider myself very fortunate to have gone through treatment for Breast Cancer in the age of technology and facebook. Eight years ago, how could women measure their results or even know about the different options available for reconstruction? Or who the quality surgeons were? I want to change that. I want to empower those going through treatment for Breast Cancer by giving them incredible tools so that will know that they are on the same page with their surgeon, in effort to stave off disappointing surprises. I want to give them peace of mind, a sense of control when there is very little control. I want to educate them so that they can improve the conversation with their surgeons around their own reconstruction. They will know what they will look like on the other side of surgery. Second, Research and Development of The Breast Cancer Previsualization App. I will create a beta test of this app which will allow me to work with 25 Breast Cancer patients anywhere in the United States. This app will be highly secure which will comply with medical clearances and an incredibly powerful tool with a user friendly interface.  My vision which takes on improving the world of Breast Cancer is a massive undertaking. No one likes talking or hearing about cancer, as no one likes being reminded of their mortality. Having to skirt the medical iron curtain in effort to give the medical community an innovate tool seems counter productive. One would think that they should want to take the lead of being innovators in medicine, but perhaps it's a far too complicated notion to take on. So now the patients will show the medical community the importance of this tool. Power To The Patient. I believe that they will prove the demand that a tool like this must exist in the world of surgical reconstruction. If we all work together, everybody wins. 
Also, I imagine this type of innovative tool going beyond the disease of Breast Cancer and into realms of helping others with disfigurements caused by other diseases or accidents. Wow, right? What I need and what I can give back.  I'm going to raise $100,000 to start.
Research and Development. The Breast Cancer Previsualization App will cost anywhere between $50K-70K to design, develop and research. And it could take up to 3 months to finalize. I'm going to consult with 25 Breast Cancer Patients from anywhere in the US.  This will allow me to test the beta site which drives the app. This app will take information that will help me project an individuals surgical results through *gestural renderings on photographs that the participants will provide through our medically cleared secure app. I will then send a choreographed presentation (like in the video above) back to them through our secure app so that they can show their doctor on their smart phone or tablet platform. (IOS and Android.)  I will educate and train the 25 patients how to use this tool. I will also consult with them via skype or facetime. There will be no costs involved for the patients participating in my beta test. The cost to run this service per patient is $1,500, which nets out at $37,500. And in the future phases, I see these costs subsidized through philanthropic endeavors for those who cannot afford this service.
*gestural renderings will be realistic and follow the directive of the surgical recommendation and will not enter into the realm of hyper-real retouching. Awareness campaign. Most people don't even know that this type of service exists. There are plastic surgery simulator apps for those who want to see what they're going to look like with breast augmentation, a nose job or even thicker lips. Those apps are far too general for the breast reconstruction world.  Getting the word out to women who are going through treatment for Breast Cancer and driving them to this incredible tool, The  Breast Cancer Previsualization App is the bigger task at hand, but not impossible. Anything can happen when you're passionate about it.  I'm going to draw boobs in the sky hoping to reach critical mass. I'm going to create a movement on the largest canvas known to man. It will make people vigilant about improving the world of Breast Cancer. Vigilant about being innovative with healthcare. Vigilant about being leaders. My sky boobs will attract the social media world as well as local news and national media. I call it Boobs 2 The Sky. Each sky written letter costs $1800. Which means I will only be able to skywrite ""WOW""  two times during this phase of the campaign to raise awareness. Location will focus on Los Angeles first but eventually I would like to skywrite boobs over every major city in the United States. 
I will use the remaining $12,500 to put forward to our Awareness Campaign. I imagine skyboobs blowing up on instagram and contributing greatly to this innovative Movement. I will also hire researchers to cull data which will prove the efficacy of this program and they will write papers to medical journals proving that Breast Cancer Previsualization will improve how women go through Breast Cancer which will allow me to lobby so that it gets implemented into surgical protocol and that insurance companies will create an imaging code so that medical practices can offer this for free to their patients.  It's hard to be transparent about something so incredibly private. But I believe with all of my heart and soul that this is a necessary change that needs to be set into action and let the people decide if progress is the right path. I'm launching the conversation and I'm also aware that I will be launching a huge debate, which is good because that will automatically fuel my Awareness Campaign.  
Give the power to the patient first, as they'll create the demand and then the medical world will see the value of this powerful tool.  What you get for participating in this awesome campaign is a signed copy of a book that I wrote while developing this campaign, What To Expect When You're Expecting Nipples. Also a hardcover 12""x12"" photography book titled Movement, a collection of images from the most talented iphonographers in the world, who have graciously submitted their work to support this game changing initiative. We live in an era of digital photography where images speak louder than words. And this is the world that Breast Cancer Previsualization evolved from. Photography is a powerful tool.  Art and Medicine working together. My experience is in the world of Advertising, Architecture and now Breast Cancer. I am confident in launching large gestures and campaigns to raise awareness on a global level. This self-induced initiative is the perfect storm where all of my skills, talent and experiences have come together to create a cancer game changing event in the world of Breast Cancer. I know first hand what it's like to be a patient going through treatment for Breast Cancer and confident that my creative expertise will affect the world of caring for those going through treatment for Breast Cancer for the better. Women who have already gone through treatment have expressed that they wished that this amazing tool was available when they were going through treatment. Here are a couple of quotes from various Breast Cancer support groups from all around the world:  ""So wish I had this app when I did it. I'm way too big. Went from a barely B to a full D! I was told I would be a large B to small C!""  ""Where was this when I needed it! I need a revision...""  ""My revision surgery is on June 6th. Reduction and lift as well as mesh placement in abs because of botched messes from past surgeons."" My qualifications as a creative veteran and experience in the world of advertising will allow me tack through the challenges brought on by this heavy hitting initiative. Also, I went through treatment for Breast Cancer. I am well versed in that world and extremely empathetic for those who have to go through it. With my experience and vision, I will improve it. Here's how you can help I understand that if you cannot contribute financially, there are other ways to help by raising awareness about this campaign. You can join my team of fundraisers who work daily getting the word out through facebook, twitter or word of mouth. Or you can casually share a link on your facebook page. This is how the word will spread and one day we will live in a world where breast centers and surgeons will offer this to their patients. #Boobs2TheSky",1.0,2297,127,1e-05,29.296886574074072,4,2,2015,1,1,16,breast cancer,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

Travelling and being somewhat of a Cancer Advocate...well I was hooked; so now I am looking to create my own sort of follow up project- a photo exhibit of what it means to live with, through and beyond cancer.  I have been asked so many times about a follow-up project; I am putting together a very meaningful and memorable photo exhibit to show the faces of cancer and the cancer experience through the lens of a camera.  I will be attending Camp Koru this fall which is a camp for Young Adults who have Cancer.  The camp itself is paid for but I need to raise funds for the flight along with the few days I will be spending camping or hostelling to see Pearl Harbour and for the other costs of the photos which will be exhibited at the Helson Gallery in Georgetown and the Project Gallery in Toronto (in 2015).

To covey the emotion, vulnerability, and strength each of the KAHLO models experienced through their unique battle conquering cancer. While at the same time showing them raw on canvas, with battle scars and all, for the world to see, pure unadulterated beauty. Currently we are looking for the finishing cap to our budgeting goals. We are looking to obtain $10,000 to ensure KAHLO's status as a international art staple of 2014. DESCRIPTION: KAHLO is a week long exhibit located in New York N.Y. in the summer of 2014. There will be approximately 40 canvas', each with its own model and story, as well as contemporary structural art throughout the venue. The venue for the exhibit will be at a private location, for the reason that a show like this with such a specific goal requires a more intimate platform to better reach our guests. For the opening night of KAHLO, which will be held on a Friday eve, we plan to have a 200-300 guest list premier including full bar service, live music, and hors d'oeuvres prepared by the very talented chef Eric Hanson (of breakfast television, Nieche, and food network hopeful). The following 6 days will entail a open house type show for the general public which will entail full access to the exhibit as well as a print store for those who wish to purchase prints of the canvas'. The last weekend of the exhibit will be available for rent for private parties if booked, and if not will continue regular operation until the following Sunday. All canvas' and structural art will be for sale through silent auction where bidders will be informed, via phone/email, of any change to biding price until the last day of the exhibit when sales will be finalized. PLANNED ACTIVITIES/ TIMELINE The first objective for the project is to find a suitable venue for the exhibit. Therefore I will be going to New York in December on a location scout with the help of a hired local realtor. As well as to find a suitable promotional company, event company, and art publicist to ensure proper execution of the project. Once the proper venue is chosen we will book a date for KAHLO and start advertising the event in art specific magazines, websites, news outlets, billboards, posters, flyers, and any and all advertising media we find through out our project construction. Furthermore once a date is chosen we will be producing double finger rings to use as tickets for the opening night of KAHLO, which will be available for purchase in the on location print shop. Closer to the KAHLO's opening I plan to execute a large scale promotional stunt down town New York via live art piece with the goal to reach those who have yet to hear of our project. As of right now we are currently in contact with the University of Alberta hospital and other groups that are involved with cancer survivors to obtain models for  the exhibit and have already launched the first installment of KAHLO to the public. Below are images of the first canvas title ""LIVE LOVE LEARN EMRACE"" and the launch party which was held in Edmonton Alberta. As the weeks go by we plan to have smaller shows through out western Canada to show the progression of KAHLO as the project grows in interest and content. Through out the project creation we will be contacting other artists in multiple forms of media, as well as certain individuals in film and T.V. requesting support from them and their fan bases.  BUDGET EXPENSES: (**our project goal is a portion of our total budget**) location/venue promotion company event company event staffing models transport/lodging transport of work food/drink for premier  advertising production costs",74.67640944,656,24,0.0082,42.03943287037037,2,0,2014,1,1,23,general,1,0,1,0,0.001524390243902439,0.0,0.06133333333333333,2.44865576592129,0.0,kickstarter

Just message me if you want to add something to your level.  Imagine for a moment that you were the worlds strongest protector. Imagine that no knife, bullet or bomb can harm you. Then imagine in that moment you are told you have cancer. The Mighty Titan is a character who is for all intents and purposes, invulnerable. He cannot be harmed by any means known to man. His alter ego doesn't have such luck. Titan's alter ego is dying. What now?  Isn't this the perception that we all have when not touched by cancer? We are all under the belief that we are invulnerable.  Aren't we all someone's protector? Aren't we all everything to someone?  Not until that lump, or pain, or (un)lucky scan.  How we deal with this defines us. How we live with this strengthens us. What we lose is innocence and the loss of a clear mind. This is my epitaph. This is my way of dealing. This is my way of helping others understand what it feels like to be invulnerable...   And then, one conversation, one sentence later... never feeling that way again.  ""I am sorry, Mr. Martino. You have adeno cell carcinoma."" were the last words my 33 year old innocent, clear-minded self ever heard. From that day forward, I had cancer. Life was over. Even though, through the support and resolve of my friends, family and doctors. I survived. Twice.  WRITER/CREATOR: Joe Martino - Joe has been creating comics since he was 10 years old. His big ""break"" came when he decided to do everything (mostly) on his own and publish Shadowflame back in 1996. Since then, he has been published by Arcana with Shadowflame and Ripperman, Main Enterprises, Coscom Entertainment and a slew of other independent publishers and made some great friends along the way.  And, of course the awesome team who brought us The Mighty Titan #1 and 2! PENCILER: Luca Cicchitti - His pencils are bringing Titan to life in a way we couldn't have imagined. His pencils on issue 1 and 2 of Titan were critically acclaimed. Wait until you see what he is doing with issue 3! Flashback PENCILER: Cory Smith - Cory Smith is an illustrator and comic artist living and working in New York. Since graduating from the Joe Kubert School in 2004, Cory has worked with clients such as Nickelodeon, Hasbro, Disney, Crayola, and many others on a wide variety of projects and properties. Cory is the artist on the Aspen series Legend of the Shadow Clan and BROKEN PIECES. He is also the co-creator of THE INDEPENDENTS with writer Ben Christian. INKER: Jeff Austin - In 1965, Jeff was born. At present, the story hasn't ended. Jeff is also very well known in the indy comic scene and one of the best inkers out there. He has worked for Image (Big Bang Comics) Main Enterprises (Betsy and more), Arcana (Shadowflame, Ripperman. Dead Men Tell No Tales) , Trinity Comics (The Wraith) Faust, FemForce and many others.  COLORIST: Keith J. Betancourt - For those who know him, Keith is considered a triple threat. He is a penciler, inker and digital colorist. As a colorist, some of his work includes the cover to Time Flyz Volume 8, The DVD Cover to Worst that can Happen (Interspecies Wrestling), art for the NJ hardcore band Ripface Invasion and more from the independent comic Megazeen. Since the age of 2 Keith has been honing his skills, anticipating the day when he can officially break through the comic book world and and show them what he can really do.  Letterer: Adam O. Pruett - Adam Pruett letters for Image, Antarctic Press, JGM, Arcana, Markosia, Ronin Studios, 215 Ink, and others.

I am now finally able to say I am well on my way to finalizing this goal - a published photobook of my mother's photography. As she died from ovarian cancer which continues to have a very low survival rate, all proceeds from book sales will go towards ovarian cancer research. Her photos span from the 80's through the 00's. Her work adds a unique beauty to the typical mundane family photo album. There is no question that this is true art and not solely memories, although for those of you who knew her this will have an even more special place in your heart. She was never one to acknowledge her talent, in any field, so I would like to showcase to the world what a beautiful thing it is to see through her eyes. While she took incredible nature photos and many other styles of photography, I will be focusing this book on her work that encompasses childhood, love, and family in America. I have rarely, if ever, seen someone capture the joy of childhood in the way that she did. Her photographs are extremely personal and intimate; filled to the brim with all the wonders that life has to give. They offer a glimpse into the past, and into the beautiful human that Carol was.  ****For those who didn't know her, the video is mainly photos of Carol herself, and a TINY sampling of her work.  The funds are needed to help the costs of scanning the hundred of negatives, those of which are selected will be scanned high resolution which costs a fair amount more. Then the much larger part of the budget is of course printing the book - I want everything to be done perfectly, on the ideal paper and binding/cover, with impeccable high quality printing, and of course I want my layout designs to be followed correctly.  !!!!!! If somehow I gather more funds than are necessary for the book, all excess will go to the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund Alliance (https://ocrfa.org).

You can read the piece here: Putting My Camera Down, and Finally Mourning My Parents Cancer Family is the story of family, looking at the experiences of two parents who were in parallel treatment for stage-four cancer, side by side. The project looks at love, life, and living in the face of death. It honors their memory by focusing on their strength and compassion, both individually and together, and shares the story of their final chapters, which came to a close just 364 days after each other. The initial photographs in this story were made out of necessity. I was often at the hospital helping my parents, and knew that I needed some kind of distance from the reality of the situation. Here were both of my parents, hooked up to beeping machines, with poison coursing through their veins for hours. I was terrified. Being a photographer, my camera was the obvious tool with which I created a space where I could be present but also protect myself. I  realized very quickly, however, that  the story I was seeing unfold was not just about illness. It was much more than that—it was about getting the most out of the days we had left, as a family, and about my recording of this beautiful and complicated time we spent together. I hoped to capture the essence of who they were, the lives they lived, and the lessons we learned in the process. If the Kickstarter campaign is successful, this project will be developed into a beautiful book of photographs, journals, found items, and personal anecdotes. There will also be a traveling exhibition to follow. It will tell the story of my parents’ journeys through their illnesses. It will also look back on their lives before they were sick, from the moment they met to life with kids and finishing with their final chapters. They did not want to be defined by their diseases; they were many things other than cancer patients. If we surpass our goal, this will allow for extra copies of the book to be printed and donated to schools, support groups, and hospitals. The book will be used as a tool,  and as an example of comfort, community, and strength for those experiencing illness or loss.

 Example layouts from the book: “For my three angels- Courage isn’t the absence of fear, its knowing that you are afraid and doing it anyway. Don’t spend your days avoiding risk and being fearful. Act, live your life on your own terms. Life is precious—spend it without regrets in your precious voice. IF you want to talk or feel my love, look up in the night sky- I am always watching over you.”- Mom We found these words scribbled on small, square Post-It notes in the depths of our parents’ room as we begin the exhausting process of clearing out the house. Mom had only died two months earlier, but we knew that if we didn’t start the process, we might never finish it. Dad had died a year earlier, also of cancer, and one of mom’s greatest fears was that she would die before having a chance to share with us, her three kids, how much she truly loved us.

Selling. Novel. stuff you should know . . . before I go"" As a journalist, I always wanted to ‘write a best selling novel,’ and carried around a post-it note listing this dream, for more than a decade. My book, is now a bucket list must and titled: “Best. Selling. Novel.  ‘stuff you should know . . .before I go.” With a diagnosis of Stage 4, terminal cancer, I can no longer rely on the submission and waiting process of getting my book to big publishing houses in hopes of securing a bestseller status. Best Seller – the term- is based on ‘number of books sold in a short period of time.’ So it is, with journalistic integrity, that I wrote a book touted as ‘inspiring, funny, candid (sometimes TMI), and decided I must pull up my big girl panties and get this book out there as quickly as possible. In its final editing stage by journalism friends, the book will be self-published and ready for the public by April 5 on Amazon.   ‘Self-published’ no longer delineates a lowly status, but signifies more of a way for impatient ( or terminal) writers who just want to get their words to the world without waiting on a publishing house to decide its marketability, based on the opinions of one or two people who may or may not read it.   Kickstarter funds will help me publish, print and ship to journalists worldwide in an effort to make it a Best. Selling. Novel. I already believe in the success of this campaign and am prepared to purchase books and already writing press releases, creating media kits with books to distribute to print and television journalists, talk show hosts, bloggers, and anyone who can help me make this book a best seller. We have 30 days! The Project Goal. 
I believe in this book. I believe in the goal, and I believe in your ability to help me make it become a best seller. Because I love to pay it forward, if this book hits target, then I will ensure other writers and cancer fighters not only get a copy of this book, but I will also give someone an opportunity and help them write and publish THEIR story. I WILL pass it on and pay it forward and backward and sideways.

Homanje is a silent film of 40 minutes with dancing and acting. Without the strong team behind the movie, this project would not have been possible. For more information, please visit our website www.homanje.com  The story  The story of Homanje consists of two parts Part 1 is about how the life of the main character could have been if she'd survive cancer. The happy ending that we want everyone to have. Part 2 - is loosely based on the story of my grandmother. The main character is told she has only three more months to live. You will learn about the struggles while fighting cancer. The movie is Dutch, however we will have English subtitles. (there is not much that need to be translated, while it is a silent film) Dance  We love dancing, and we know sometimes one movement can say more than a thousand words. We used dance styles such as Contemporary, Hip Hop, Tango and Classic ballet to strengthen the silence. The name  ""Homanje"" Homanje is a contraction of two words: The Spanish word Homenaje (hommage) and the word Grandma in Dutch (Oma). Steffie did not have any experience in making a movie, but with a lot of passion and dedication she made her dream come true. She couldn't have done it without her professional team! What will we do with your money? We will put Homanje online, so people can pay to watch the video, but that costs money. We want Homanje to be online for at least 5 years. Every year the costs are about 200 euros.  Also, we would like to send Homanje to some online and offline film festivals. Some of them ask subscription fee. If we reach our goal we would be so happy! But if we reach more, we would be jumping in the air! Then, we want to start campaigns and hopefully get Homanje on national and international tv!  When you watch Homanje online, you will help a lot of families who are dealing with cancer.

ANGEL OF HOPE DETAILED SYNOPSIS: Lacey Smith (Emma Lyle), a young child whom has been battling leukemia, gets visited by her loving father Martin (Elijah Chester). As she becomes aware of her final days to come, she becomes more afraid and struggles to comprehend her diagnosis. Martin, who tries his best to remain strong, explains that there's a whole other world in our very existence. A universe filled with joy and possibilities more than the imagination can carry. As he tries to find the words to ease her pain and frustration, he reminisces on their time shared and that special place they always seem to visit. As Lacey's fears begin to drift the knowledge of death becomes non-existent. This short yet heart felt piece inspires adults and children alike to always push farther and no matter what obstacles come your way, there is always something greater waiting for you. This riveting story between a father and daughter helps bring families together, and teaches us to embrace every moment of life we have. OUR GOAL: In being an independent film company, we love the pure joy of cinema. We are shooting a short film titled 'Angel of Hope' that tells the story of a young girl who is battling leukemia. It showcases the bond between a father and daughter. There is only so much that can be done when treating one with cancer and sometimes you have to let God take over because he has a plan for us all. We want to help people understand that their is a whole other universe beyond our very existence... that being heaven. Our ultimate goal for this short is to send out DVD packages to children's hospitals all over the U.S. We are hoping to have Marlo Thomas make a Public Service Announcement about the piece. That would lead to major exposure. Local and major film festivals are also a goal. The major festivals include, Cannes, Sundance, Berlin, Toronto etc.. The overall budget for this production is $1,500. $5,000 of post services are being provided for no cost to us. We are just greatful and excited that we were introduced to Kickstarter.
Seeing as this is only a 3 day shoot, everyone involved with Angel of Hope are pulling favors and working for free. They believe in the cause, they believe in the project and they want to help see it succeed. You wouldn't believe how loyal the local film community is when helping other filmmakers in need.

It is an adult coloring book/journal with an inspiring mission:  To empower people touched by cancer and others navigating major life challenges to process their changes while they co-create the book, and to encourage them to heal though connectivity by sharing what they create and learn. It is a great gift for people dealing with the biggest challenges and changes in their lives. Who Needs To Know About This? I am the empowered survivor I most needed to know about 10 ½ years ago when I found out I had brain cancer. 20 Poems 20 Paintings A Creative Warrior’s Journal is the book I most needed to know about when I first started negotiating the “new normal” of fighting brain cancer. In fact, it was at that time that I began writing the poems in it, with no idea that some day they would help a lot of people or be in this book.  Who Will This Help? It is going to help people who want to support loved ones in need but aren’t sure what to do.  It will illuminate a pathway for those who are passing through some of the darkest times of their lives by helping them to access and practice faith, equanimity and gratitude.  One of the main beneficiaries of this project are cancer fighters in financial need. When I was sick and scared, writing the poems in it helped heal me.   When I was devastated in grief, painting the pictures in it made me feel better, and perhaps most significantly, when I shared my work with others, talking  about our common experiences helped to heal us all.  As a community of inspired creative support grows from this book, this phenemenon will help more and more people. How Does It Work? I designed 20Poems 20 Paintings  A Creative Warrior’s Journal  to inspire people process their major challenges and changes while co-creating it.   
My poems and paintings provide an empowering foundation for co-creators to build from. Please look through the transformational block of four book pages from the book directly below.  This  illustrates the way this book will support some co-creators’ processes while getting out of the way of those who want to do things their own way.  A Transformative Block: Four Sample Pages From  20 Poems 20 Paintings  A Creative Warrior's Journal Please Help Finish This Book! 20 Poems 20 Paintings  A Creative Warrior’s Journal is not finished and it wont be until my co-creators complete their part of book.  

This kickstarter will fund printing of run of archival quality copies of this book on 80# Accent font stock.  The interior will be elegant, inviting  and durable.  Co-creators  will enjoy the bliss of doing all of their work in the books and be left with a genuinely beautiful  and enduring historical documents to share when they are done.  
If you want to help a cancer fighter, survivor, support person, this is an excellent transformative gift, it is the gift of empowerment, creativity and connectivity.

My name is Mischa Fellez Johnston. Throughout my life, art has been my emotional refuge, and many others have discovered how the cherished childhood activity of coloring is a revolutionary form of adult therapy! I want to share this amazing respite with the world! I have illustrated a restorative adult coloring book entitled Meditative Imaginings: A Curative Coloring Experience, and I hope to leave a legacy of comfort with the time I have on this Earth by raising funds for the publication of 500 copies to be given to local health organizations around Oregon!  Psychologists told the Huffington Post that, “by engaging multiple parts of the brain, coloring allows us to use our imaginations, be creative, and DE-stress” as well as being a useful tool for patients with cancer, PTSD, adult ADHD, OCD, in group therapy, and even for those needing to work on their fine motor coordination. You can now join me, and be part of this nostalgic, and inspiring contribution!  By donating the few dollars you spend in a day on things like coffee, an extra value meal, or cigarettes to this campaign, you will give immense comfort to veteran soldiers, cancer patients, and so many others struggling to just hold on another day. This project is twenty years in the making, and I am so excited to extend all of you the chance to become part of this fantastic contribution!  AMBITIONS FOR 'Meditative Imaginings':  Coloring reassures a feeling of accomplishment, making the colorist proud of their talents, and inspiring them to rediscover their joy again!
This beautifully embellished book has been specifically created to empower perseverance through creativity. By reconnecting with the child inside, and embracing the present moment, there is no longer room in the jumbled mind for stress, and fears. Like dancing, coloring has no rules, and only exists to be enjoyed as simple self-care.  In my extensive research, I found that most adult coloring books are digitally fabricated, and only showcase one style; usually metrical patterns or garden themes. My coloring book has been hand drawn, re-sketched numerous times, lovingly inked over until creative perfection was achieved, and delivers unique takes on three classic coloring styles. The designs have a comforting, personal touch with a level of effort, and originality that surpasses all other coloring books, and can be found no where else!  SPECIFICATIONS FOR 'Meditative Imaginings':  I've created something for every mood within the three sections of this book which incorporate a variety of styles including:  
-Floral Zoology  -Paisley Fantasy Creatures   -Steam Punk Art Nouveau Each of the 24, 8 x 10 original drawings, has been scanned, and enhanced, and will be printed on high quality paper perfectly paired for completion with colored pencils, crayons, and colored pens.  The drawings are completed, and the prototypes have been pre-ordered. All I need are the funds, and belief of fellow dreamers like you to deliver this exceptional artwork to the ones who need it most in the community!  THE REWARDS:  WHAT WILL YOU RECEIVE IN RETURN FOR YOUR GENEROSITY?  Along with custom printed panel sketches, full color art prints chosen from the two eclectic styles below, original coloring templates for you current coloring fans, your name immortalized as a 'Dream Maker' on every copy of the coloring book I print, I'm also offering hand embellished & personalized prints, as well as one of a kind commissioned art pieces!

I need your help for the crucial last phase of production!  The creation of The Materiality of Impermanence is fundamentally about embracing change in the face of a life-altering event.  Since my diagnosis, dance has become—not simply something that I do—but the means to heal and share my story with others.  This project is my humble attempt to make sense of our shared mortality, and to celebrate the beauty and unexpected resilience of our spirits. WHERE WE ARE This summer I worked intensively with nine amazing dancers to create three solos, one trio, and four group pieces.You can enjoy a short video clip of rehearsal by clicking here. I have organized a post-performance panel, entitled “Art and Healing”, featuring six breast cancer survivors who have experienced the healing power of art, and who will share their own stories of transformation. I am particularly excited about the participation of Kalila B. Homann, MA, LPC, ADTR, a psychotherapist and dance movement therapist with over twenty years of experience in teaching and utilizing movement in a psychotherapeutic context, who will share recent research that documents the healing benefits of art. Fundraising efforts for The Materiality of Impermanence have been immensely successful: the project has received grants from The Ella Lyman Cabot Trust, the Redd Carpet Fund, the Puffin Foundation and contributions from over 60 individuals.  I am incredibly grateful for this support. There is, however, still money that needs to be raised. THIS CAMPAIGN With your help, this “Wrap-It-Up” campaign will cover the $3,000 necessary for scenic materials, construction and design. Your contribution, whether large or small, will support the crucial last phase of The Materiality of Impermanence, thus ensuring that it becomes what it is meant to be: an ode to the eternal within each one of us.

My mom passes away from breast cancer and I have become more aware of what is good for me to put on my body. We hear how the talcum powders caused cancer in women and I want to help the situation by making and using my own ""ALL NATURAL DEODORANT"". I have begun making and selling to women in my community and at different functions as a vendor. My pastor is a triple negative cancer survivor and I make her deodorant because there is nothing in the market without the ALUMINUM CARCINOGENICS in them no matter what they call it like ""clinical"".       My deodorants are strictly made with ALL NATURAL ingredients that will keep you dry as it absorbs the sweat and not block the sweat glands like the products on the market that causes problems. The other ingredients neutralizes the odor and will give the under arm an even skin tone if discolored. Also the essential oil is an anti fungal and bacteria fighting oil for both the deodorant and your underarms. There are something out there with CHARCOAL in it but that can eventually go into your liver and cause problems, my product is pure and natural with no side affects or set backs. The deodorant is a UNISEX product that can be used by male and female! We can add a light fresh scent or no scent at all.      I have just been offered to go to my neighborhood beauty supply store to set up on the weekends and sell my products, which is so exciting! The owner approved my products and gave me the okay, so the more that I can make gives me the opportunity to put it on the shelves and give someone a better healthier choice for their deodorant needs.        I have already had rave reviews for my product and I want to take it further and possibly get it in the market place, this is why I am here on kick starter after hearing so many people talk about how they got their help here. The more materials that I can purchase the more I can make and help someone out there searching for a better and more healthy deodorant that really works. My part time job does now allow me to expand on my own right now so that is why I am here also with the hopes of giving someone the opportunity to try a better deodorant for a healthier choice!!

After retiring to Rhode Island I became familiar with a breast cancer support group, ""The Gloria Gemma Breast Cancer Resource Foundation"". Through this organization I came to know the most wonderful group of women who became my ""Bosom Buddies""   For the last six months I have been photographing my ""buddies"" as they kayak, ride horses, work in their gardens, sing, do yoga and other activities they love. My own self portrait will be photographed with my boxing gloves on, in the rink, where at the age of 69, I began to kick box. Photography, being both my profession for many years and a continuing passion, has always drawn me to trees and the images that my mind sees woven into the bark and branches . The following tells the story of my original inspiration for this book, ""Bosom Buddies"" In the spring of 1993, I was drawn to a magnificent tree over 400 years old in Ledyard, Connecticut. Standing 90 feet high, with a circumference of over 26 feet, the tree had been declared dead in June of 1969 due to damage by gypsy moths. In its younger days it was a sacred place where Native Americans would come together to vote and decide on important tribal issues. I took many photographs and upon returning home, quickly developed and printed my images. On close inspection, I began to see a one breasted figure that immediately inspired me to create an aquatint etching which I titled ""BOSOM BUDDY"". Although gnarled and broken, I discovered the soul that lived on in this timeless beauty. In 2009, a new white oak was planted in its shadow as the old lady needed to be taken down, her life having been an inspiration for all those who chanced to meet her. In the spring of 1992, I too, had found myself gnarled and broken when I was first diagnosed with breast cancer and treated with a radical mastectomy of my right breast.The Ledyard Oak became my Bosom Buddy and helped me relate to my inner beauty that was so much more meaningful than what was found beneath my clothing. For over twenty years I have had the dream of creating a book of photos and essays showing the scars and reconstructions, the thoughts, fears, inner spirit, and especially the HOPES of those brave enough to bare their bodies and show their beauty, all inspired by this magnificent tree.  I hope you are as excited about this publication as I am and will consider contributing to this project so that it might become a reality.",108.56,459,15,0.2714,36.52990740740741,10,4,2014,1,1,23,breast cancer,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

  Matthew’s father Jim was diagnosed with cancer in 2009, and had been a top level athlete all of his life, competing at county level in athletics, and being an Olympic coach to Matthew’s mother. The day before being diagnosed with bowel cancer that had spread to his liver, he had competed in the Great North Run, raising money for British Heart Foundation, as he had suffered a major heart attack back in 2006, what he didn't know at the time of the run was that he had earlier that week suffered from another heart attack, as well as about to be diagnosed with cancer. Even through all that he ran a time of 85 minutes, which for a half marathon is an impressive time, when healthy let alone after that.
 
But in that enjoyment of running, of family and the wonderful man that Jim was, that even in the following dark years, he remained positive and inspired the hearts and souls of everyone he met. But in July 2013 Jim sadly passed away at the age of 59.
 
It is for him and for others like him that this anthology is for, to celebrate their lives, the wonders that they have accomplished and to show that cancer can’t beat us. For everyone But this Anthology isn't just about me. Cancer affects us all; whether you've been diagnosed with it yourself or you know and have supported someone who has it. So this Anthology is a place where everyone who has been affected by cancer, no matter how, can express their feelings and tell us their journey. Some stories will be sad, some will be happy but all stories in the Anthology will be focused on what it's like to live with cancer. Why Kickstarter?

My first impression was that I was going to hate her. 
She asked for my help with a roll of film and we started talking.
By the end of the day, I just knew we were going to be friends. But that day... 
I had no idea what kind of a friend she would become.  
The best kind of friend a girl could ask for...  I'll never forget the day I heard the news.  I was standing in my bathroom, getting ready for work when Lauren called... ""Hey - I have some bad news..."" (I thought...""Shit...she's gonna cancel girls night this week."")  ""I have breast cancer.""
(holy shit)  ""Don't freak out or cry or anything... it's gonna be ok.""
(after a moment of panic, I said...  ""Well now what...?"")

Or ever could've imagined would happen to me.  I remember sitting in that room hearing those words…we found some cancer…and feeling almost paralyzed.   As odd as it sounds…I wanted to laugh.  Hard.  How in the world could this be happening to me?!?!?  I’m young.  I’m healthy.  I don’t have time for cancer.  Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse...I got more bad news.  Chemo.  This one hit me the hardest. ____________________________________________________________________ SIDNE: So your best friend has breast cancer. 
I'm sure you can imagine all the thoughts and fears that would consume my mind... so I'll skip that part. Lauren was going to have to go through chemo.  She forbade me from shaving my head... 
but I had to do SOMETHING.  I bought my very first lottery ticket so that I could win and pay all her medical bills.  In case that didn't pan out (it didn't)...I just needed to DO something.  Lauren and I agreed some years ago, that if we were ever stumped on birthday gifts, we would both like to receive coffee table art books... and SHOES!  We have always shared a love for shoes, and always lamented that we don't wear the same size.  It wasn't her birthday, and there wasn't a reason to celebrate per se... but a gift seemed appropriate. One day, about a week before chemo started, I was out shopping for the softest, cutest, best scarves available and stopped in a shoe store. I had an idea.  
And that's when I saw them. The Shoes.
These were no birthday shoes... These would be her Chemo Shoes... The morning of Lauren's first chemo treatment, I packed a bag with snacks, games, magazines and gifts.  (Lauren LOVES surprises and receiving gifts.  I  L - O - V - E  giving the perfect gift, and this time I had it). After she checked in and and the doctors prepped her, I unpacked the gifts.
When I saw the look on her face as she opened that box... I knew I had nailed it. ____________________________________________________________________ LAUREN: I'll never forget my first day of chemo.  I was terrified out of my mind but tried to not let it show.  My now husband and best friends came with me to try to take the edge off which is something I will always be grateful for.  As we settled into our corner with bags upon bags of games and snacks and all things happy...I was ready to get started.  I had worked this up so much in my head that I was sure the chemo drugs were going to feel like acid in my veins.  As the first medicine started...my best friend, Sidne, pulled out a box.   I immediately got a huge smile on my face because who knew you got presents for starting chemo?!  As I made my way through the wrapping paper and opened the box, I had to laugh out loud at what I saw.  High heels.  And not just any high heels.  Five inch, bright blue, glittery, spike covered heels that couldn't have been more perfect.  As I held the shoes up for everyone to see...Sid went on to explain that they were my chemo shoes.  Because in those shoes I was going to kick cancer's ass. And that's exactly what I did.  I wore them to every single treatment...without fail.  And over time a funny thing started to happen.  I actually started to look forward to when I got to wear those shoes.  When I thought about chemo I didn't think of sickness and meds and my disease...I thought about those shoes.  And in the middle of something very dark and depressing...they gave me a reason to smile.  And more importantly...they gave me hope.  When I look back on my time battling cancer...I immediately think about those shoes.  I don't think about how horrible I felt about myself...or the endless doctor appointments...or the sickness...or the countless hours spent hooked up to machines.  I think about my chemo shoes.  Because when everything else seemed so grim...those shoes were my little piece of happiness.  Sidne knew when she gave them to me they would be exactly what I needed.  And she was so right.   When you are diagnosed with cancer, everyone wants to help.  They want to do something.  But truthfully...there's nothing they can do.  They can be there for you.  They can buy you hats and scarves and cozy chemo blankets...or they buy you SHOES!!   Sidne and I both knew we had to share our story with the world.  Because we know just how powerful these shoes can be.  These shoes are something friends and family can give to empower their loved ones.  To inspire them to dig down deep and let out their inner superhero.  To give them something to look forward to.  And most importantly, to give them hope when it is so desperately needed.   Our story has inspired us to make it possible for every woman battling any kind of disease to rock their own pair of Healing Heels.  With your help, we hope to manufacture a line of seriously kick-ass shoes for women everywhere to conquer whatever it is they are facing.  We hope that these shoes will breathe life into people who really need it...and we need you to help us do just that. And to anyone who says a pair of shoes can't change the world...think again.  Because they sure changed mine. Thank you so much for believing in us and the power of Healing Heels.   Know someone who would love to rock some Healing Heels? Here's how you can help spread the love: We will love you forever.  :) ____________________________________________________________________ DISCLAIMER: These shoes in no way treat, prevent, or cure any type of disease or illness.

These conditions can be scary and children may have lots of questions. The ""Nurse Ted"" books present age-appropriate information and stories of children who are going through similarly difficult times.  
Kerry is a neuro-oncology clinical nurse specialist at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford and initially wanted to produce a book about brain tumours to give to her patients and their children. Ffi is a writer and illustrator of children's picture books and, together, we self-funded the creation and publication of what would become the first book of the series, ""Nurse Ted: A Children's Guide to Brain Tumours.""  
It has received great reviews and support.  
 ""We are proud to support Nurse Ted. Children whose parents are affected by a brain tumour can face a difficult and uncertain time and there has been a lack of information for them to help them understand what is happening. Nurse Ted will be a very helpful resource for families in future.""
The Brain Tumour Charity. 
""Nurse Ted is an excellent resource to help a carer mediate the diagnosis of a brain tumour with a child. There can be nothing more difficult than talking with a child about what it means to have a brain tumour. This book, with its beautiful illustrations and clarity of language, makes this less daunting. It's a gift to any adult who is living with this diagnosis."" 
Brainstrust, The Brain Cancer People.   
""I really liked the book because instead of a boring document about cancer it is a children's book overflowing with colourful pictures and it is interesting and yet a story book! Also I didn't know what was happening inside dad until I read this book. Thank you for writing this book. I loved it!"" 
""Nurse Ted: A Children's Guide to Brain Tumours"" is now listed on the Brain Tumour Charity's list of helpful books.  As reviews were so positive, we wanted to make the book more available and also to raise funds to create a more general book to help parents and other family members who have other types of cancer explain their diagnoses and treatment to their children. 
So we created, ""Nurse Ted: A Children's Guide to Cancer."" 
In this book, Nurse Ted explains to Ben that his mum has cancer. Like the first book of the series, the ""Children's Guide to Cancer"" provides a reassuring way to present information in an easy-to-understand format.  
With age-appropriate information and language, Nurse Ted communicates with Ben in a way he understands. The picture book format, a familiar medium for children, provides a reassuring way to present information in one place. Containing a Glossary of Terms, Parent's/ Carer's Cut-Out Guide, Questions and Answers Section, and Side Effects page, the book is also a useful resource for adults.  
We have already received great pre-publication reviews from an initial pilot study. 
 “What a great book! I have been working as a children’s counsellor for the 
past eight years, supporting them when their parents are diagnosed with 
cancer and other life-limiting illnesses. This book would have been so useful to 
have. It explains treatment in terms that a child can understand, and will be a 
wonderful resource to have in my kit bag! I just wish I had it a few years ago."" Julie Cole BA (Hons) MBACP Accred.
Family Services manager, The Fountain Centre. 
“The Nurse Ted books continue to provide invaluable advice for children, parents and their families. It’s a great way of introducing a complicated subject and providing an opportunity to explore some of the issues faced by people when a loved one is unwell. I would recommend the latest Nurse Ted book to anyone going through this difficult experience.” The Right Honourable Anne Milton, Member of Parliament for Guildford.

A young slacker (Rupert Rio) who has lived his adult life mooching off his parents, getting drunk every night, chasing women, and finding every excuse in the book to not keep a job, finds himself diagnosed with stage 2 Breast Cancer.  Unable to break the news to his parents out of shame and fear, Rupert takes the advice of his doctor and checks himself into a non-profit health clinic where he can receive special attention for his condition. Once at the clinic, Rupert is astonished to find out that he is the only male patient in an all women's health clinic.  Rupert attempts to bring his lazy, self-absorb, pompous attitude to the clinic, but the female patients are not having none of that. Rupert finds himself surrounded by a group young, old, savvy, energetic, snappy, and colorful group of women who refuse to allow cancer or Rupert, to spoil their life. With the stress of being cured and the issues of facing responsibility, Rupert must embark on a hilarious, insightful and meaningful journey through the words and actions of these female patients.  There is nothing funny about having a serious and life-threating condition. However the attitude and approach to overcoming cancer can have such an enormous effect.   My grandmother overcame her cancer by staying upbeat and high-spirited. She viewed her medication and surgery as 50% of the remedy. The other 50% was her attitude and her eagerness to still have an abundant life. It is very easy to allow any illness to take a mental and physical toll on your body when all you can think about is the sadness, loss of hope and stress.

Suncho. Stay covered, look cool. I’ll
bet most of you had no idea that severe sunburns before age 18, put you at risk for Actinic Keratosis and Melanoma skin cancer. Actinic Keratoses are often so small that they are recognized by touch
rather than sight. It feels as if you were running a finger over sandpaper, or itchy dry spots.
For everyone that you might see or feel, there are even more that you can't see or feel. If you have Actinic Keratoses, you have sun damage and are at risk for other skin cancers.  Basal
Cell Carcinomaoften look like open
sores, red patches, pink growths, shiny bumps, or scars and can be highly
disfiguring if allowed to grow, but almost never spreads (metastasizes) beyond
the original tumor site. Anyone who has had a Basal
Cell Carcinoma is also more likely to develop Squamous Cell Carcinoma. When Squamous Cell Carcinomas are left untreated, they may spread
to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes and internal organs.
Although this doesn't happen often, it's serious when it doe Melanoma
is the most serious form of skin cancer and causes 75% of all skin cancer
deaths. Left untreated, it can spread to other organs. Ultraviolet
(UV) radiation from the sun is the number-one cause of skin cancer. Even
in the winter UV rays are present, in daylight, cloudy or orvercast days, you don't have to see the sun to get zapped with rays! This information is from the Mayo Clinic, WebMD and the Skin Cancer Foundation,
The Center for Disease and Control, my dermatologist, and me. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
recommends wearing a hat, sunglasses, SPF 15 sunscreen, and PROTECTIVE
CLOTHING!  I wear a hat, sunglasses, and SPF 15 sunscreen. Obviously, that
wasn’t enough. So I went on line to see what I could find in skin protective
clothing. I didn’t like any of it. I’m not saying they weren’t pretty or
effective, just not an option for me. I’m fair skinned, I live in Arizona, the summer
heat can be oppressive, and the last thing I wanted was to wear more clothes!
And did I mention I was also in menopause??? Wearing more clothing was not an
option. I didn’t want long sleeved shirts or sweaters. I wanted something that
I could throw over my head and go out the door. So I came up with my own idea, a better idea. The Suncho! The Suncho is a brilliantly simple and effective
idea for sun protection. It’s easy to wear; you just throw it over your head.
No buttons, no zippers, no binding, no sleeves! And you have full range of
movement. The finger loops keep the Suncho in place. It doesn’t
matter if you’re walking the dog on a windy day, gardening or driving your car.
The Suncho keeps you covered! Not only was I protecting my arms from the sun
I’m making a fashion statement….covered can look cool. The
Suncho comes in two forms. Sun protection and fashion. The Suncho's are made in
sizes for girls and women. Preventing sunburns is key, especially under the age
of 18 as those sunburns can cause skin cancers later in life. However, it’s
just as important for teens, young women, and women of ALL ages to protect
their skin. The
Suncho is an attractive sun protective garment, if it’s cute, she’ll wear it!
If it’s easy to wear, she’ll wear it. And as most Suncho's can fit into a
sandwich bag, it’s convenient—keep a Suncho in your car! And if it gets too
hot, throw the corners over your shoulders, still looks fabulous! It’s great
for the office or for indoor-outdoor parties! The
Suncho also has a purely fashionable element. Feeling bloated or, don’t have a
shirt that matches your pants? Throw on a Suncho! And, there is no wrong way to
wear a Suncho, you can wear it asymmetrical, as a v-neck or a boat neck.  Some
Suncho's are also made with a circular neckline and still looks great no matter
how you wear it. The Suncho adds a fabulous addition to your wardrobe! The more women that I spoke to, the more uses I
found for them. Suncho's are perfect for pregnant and nursing women.
So easy to wear, just throw one over your head and you’re covered. In addition,
it saves money on maternity wear and special nursing garments. And afterwards,
it’ still a fabulous part of your wardrobe. And if you’re traveling, the Suncho will cover your
purse! No one will even see it. Move on purse-snatchers! And of course, they’re great for the beach as a
cover up, too. And in the winter, the Suncho is better than a
sweater. I made winter and fall Suncho's because the sun doesn’t care how
chilly you are, it will still burn you. And they were much better than a
sweater!  There was no tightness or bulk as in a sweater. It
just hugs you without being clingy. Like a good man.  The Suncho will be an American made product, right
here in Arizona.  The Suncho will be easy to mass-produce as it is such a simple but effective design. Fringe, lace, crystals,
or plain, sun protection, purely for fashion, beachwear, maternity wear, lots
of options! Also
available will be a detachable scarf/hood. As well as Suncho's made with water resistant fabrics. 

Available
in children’s sizes, petite, small, medium, large, and extra large. If skin cancer is something you are concerned
about, or someone you love, please back this project. Skin cancer is something
we can prevent. 1 out of 5 will get sun cancer. That’s why the Suncho was
invented! Skin cancer is aggressive and so am I because..... I am asking for $25,894, which will put me in
production right here in Arizona with the sun protective fabrics and assorted fabrics,
and trim (elastic, fringes,feathers, lace, crystals, threads) manufacturing
costs and website. As production time for manufacturing can vary, your Suncho
will be handmade, so you’ll be covered in 30 days or less! Anything extra would allow me to move the process faster. All funding will go
towards producing and marketing the Suncho.  I know there are many ideas here on
Kickstarter, but I hope I have given you a presentation that will inspire you
to fund the Suncho, you won’t get burned! There is nothing like the Suncho on the
market…yet. ",0.0,1119,84,0.0,30.0,8,4,2014,1,1,25,mixed,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

Letters about parenting my son alone, about the things he does, about how hard it is to help your parent prepare to die, about the unfairness of life. I never shared these letters with her because she had enough to worry about at the time. After she died, I continued writing letters, this time on paper, on the computer, on napkins - on anything, really, celebrating what a wonderful mother she was. I talked about all the times I felt her presence when my son did something especially stupid (yet hilarious) and I could swear I heard her laughing. I wrote about my frustration over all the times I had to be both mother and father, and I felt like I was failing miserably. I wrote about my awe at how she managed to raise three children, one with cancer, while I could barely handle one with chronic illnesses. I am beginning the process of collecting all the pieces of my writing together for publication. (Part of that means pulling out the writing that has been etched into my brain for the last 15 years. I will never forget a single word of it.) This is where you come in. I am asking for your support through the process of putting it all together, hiring editors to help keep it flowing well and concisely, hiring a graphic designer to create a cover that compels readers to pull it off the shelves, getting the right people to help me market it in the right places, and helping me afford to travel to the right events to market it. I cannot do this without your support. Cancer affects more and more people each day. I fully expect it to hit me or my son one day. It has already taken my sister, mother, father, grandmother, several cousins, uncles, aunts, etc. While it is true that they were all different types of cancer, the fact remains - it was cancer. Stories like mine are more and more relevant. I was 23 years old and suddenly a motherless daughter raising a child on her own. That is heavy, scary stuff. Somewhere out in the world, another 20-something motherless daughter is raising her child on her own and wondering how to grieve and celebrate her mother. My book needs to be in her hands. Or maybe there's a fatherless son out there who needs to read this. Please help my book become a reality.",0.0,425,24,0.0,30.0,5,6,2015,1,1,28,lung cancer,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

These art scarves will feature original poetry exploring the theme of the Heroic Journey. Participants will engage in a cumulative, collaborative textile experience beginning with guided writing sessions (led by poet, Grey Brown and assisted by Peg) and ending in wearable art made from radiantly colored silk.  Wrap Your Head Around It, an interdisciplinary residency combining writing, surface design and an ongoing discussion of women’s identity in health will be implemented in three stages engaging several distinct groups over a 6 month period. The Cancer Center at Duke Hospital in Durham, NC will host the writing sessions, serve as the central portal for disseminating art scarves and will host a public exhibition documenting the project. 
Additional creative partners include: Light Gallery, Chapel Hill, NC, art students from Meredith College, Elon University, and NC A&T University,and Mulberry Silks Sewing Studio, Carrboro, plus Frank Gallery, Chapel Hill, NC, and possibly YOU! So what is the story behind this story?  I have been messing around with poetry and letter forms forever; scribbling in notebooks, reading great writers- admiring language as essential communication and as a dynamic visual tool.  I have discovered again and again that when text become textile remarkable things can happen.   This project invites participants to contribute to a project that is monumental - not only in materials: (1000’s of words + 8 lbs of dye + 2 gallons of ink + 50 screens + 300 yards of silk + 25 spools of thread = 200 scarves.) but also in its potential to touch and transform lives, create and promote community and to help participants to find solace and support through the creative process. Released into the community, these scarves will be understood not only as public art action but also valued in a powerful intimate context.  I am very accustomed to making large textiles for empty walls. I hunger to make art that is personal in scale (the scarf) and that is sparked from making authentic emotional connections. Making, sharing giving away words has been essential to my art making process. The scarf is the perfect billboard.  To do this well I enjoy working with professional writers. And I believe that this project requires the skillful and sensitive leadership of poet, Grey Brown who has been writing with a variety of patient populations at Duke Hospital, including oncology and bone marrow transplant, for over twenty years. From 2003 -2008, Grey and I worked together at Duke, gathering writing for art quilts to fund programming for Duke’s Children’s Health Center. In addition to her work with patients, Grey has been a leader in the national arts in healthcare movement providing workshops and presentations on how to offer writing in a healthcare setting. With sufficient support, Grey and I would like to reach a wider audience with this project by presenting WRAP at the 2015 Global Alliance for Arts in Health 26th Annual International Conference.  

How is this going to work? 

1) Writing Sessions; Under the direction of poet, Grey Brown, cancer patients, caregivers and survivors will explore new definitions of the Heroic Journey. Sessions will include writing prompts, the opportunity to write and to share one’s work, word play and the creation of group poems. Participants will explore personal narratives as well as experiences shared by women whose lives have been touched by cancer.

Writing groups to be offered in ten 60-minute sessions coordinated with the Duke’s Cancer Patient Support (Oct - Dec 2014). Peg will attend all writing sessions and prepare selected texts for screen prints. Textile artist, Brooke Heuts will assist with documentation, graphic design, surface design and stitching workshops. 
2) Surface Design workshops: Peg will facilitate multiple sessions of dye and print workshops with partnering groups; Meredith College Art students, NC A&T Art students, Elon University art students and Cancer Community participants. Plus Peg will be offering semi private workshops in her home studio.  (Oct- Feb 2015. )  
3) Scarf construction: Peg will oversee a series of 5 stitching sessions with a roster of 20 experienced textile artists (students and colleagues assembled by Gignoux). Together they will piece together art scarves. Location: Mulberry Silks sewing classroom in Carrboro,NC.

 4) Public exhibition: Scarves in a banner style display with documentation by Barbara Tyroler, Brooke Heuts and video by Brandon Yow at The Frank Gallery, Chapel Hill, NC (March-April 2015) and the Cancer Center at Duke Hospital, Durham, NC (May-June 2015). 

 5) Art scarf delivery: Kristy Everette, recreational therapist at Duke Medical Center will publicize writing sessions, attend writing sessions  and work with Duke counselors and social workers to identify recipients. Participating writers and artists will also be invited to fill out registration forms for naming a recipient. ",94.16770186335404,809,37,1.0107333333333333,50.764155092592596,9,2,2014,1,1,18,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,2.0,kickstarter

have shown this project already. I just wanted to post an update about 
our progress. Last week I spent an amazing 2 days in Toronto shooting 
with Amy and her family. The interviews with Amy and her family were 
incredibly powerful and candid. I quickly threw together a little 2 
minute clip of our time there to give you guys an idea of what it was 
like. - Mike Lang (April 5th) ""The only victory that is gained through cancer is a new perspective; the only defeat is giving into bitterness."" - Mike Lang Over the past four years since being diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma, Mike Lang has dedicated his life to helping other cancer survivors live with, through and beyond cancer. Early on, Mike recognized the power of sharing stories to help cancer survivors find healing. Thanks to close friends Aaron Bryant and Fred Sprinkle of Hands On Films, Mike found the perfect opportunity to combine his passion for storytelling with the creative and compelling medium of film. Out of this great partnership and passion for storytelling has arisen two films, an adventure therapy program (Survive & Thrive Expeditions), as well as opportunities for Mike to plan and facilitate over 25 retreats, conferences, activity-based support groups and adventure therapy trips for young adult cancer survivors (to learn more about the two previous films please read below). With this new webseries, Mike and Aaron want to narrow their focus on one person's story. Amy Mcdougall-Aubin, was only 24 when she was first diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer. She was pregnant at the time and not able to undergo the traditional chemotherapy and radiation treatments and instead had to try some complementary treatments. After spending a few years in remission, the cancer metastasized to her right lung and she was diagnosed with Cervical Cancer. She is currently undergoing a very difficult round of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Amy is married with a 4 year old daughter and, with her family's permission, is allowing Mike to follow her journey as she finishes chemotherapy treatments in Toronto, gets prepared for, and finally rafts the Grand Canyon with Survive & Thrive Expeditions in August 2012.  The webseries will include candid and compelling discussions between Mike and Amy on the subject of cancer and juxtapose the drab, sterile environment of the hospital with the majesty and grander of the Grand Canyon. This great story will provide the backdrop for Mike and Amy to explore together the deeper issues around cancer ""survivorship"" and the impact that cancer can have on someone's life and the people around them. The open and honest discussion of these issues will help the hundreds of thousands of cancer survivors know that they are not alone in their struggles. The ultimate goal of this webseries is to inspire and bring people to the realization that, in Mike's own words, ""The only victory that is gained through cancer is a new perspective; the only defeat is giving into bitterness."" The webseries will be posted on YouTube and be promoted by the many cancer support organizations and networks that Mike has developed relationships with over the past few years. There is no doubt that this film will impact people in a significant way, just like the last 2 films, but it cannot be done without your help. Any and every donation is GREATLY appreciated. Please help Mike and Amy encourage cancer survivors all over the world to not only survive the difficult cancer journey, but thrive despite of it. A huge thank you for your help. Sincerely,         The Team          ps The way Kickstarter works, if we don't raise 100% of the money by the time indicated no one's credit card will be charged and the project will not happen... so tell your friends! pss If you plan on showing this to people in a setting where you will not have good internet access you might want to choose a reward level with a DVD copy. We will not be printing any extra DVD's other then those from Kickstarter. (Limited Edition!! ;) Grand Canyon photo by Ignacio Izquierdo (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) ABOUT THE OTHER FILMS Mike's first film, a feature length documentary called Wrong Way to Hope: An Inspiring Story of Young Adults and Cancer, was personally screened by Mike and his wife Bonnie 52 times in 2011. This included a cross-Canada tour where the film was shown in 14 different cancer centres to over 1400 cancer care professionals. This film is currently being used in university nursing courses across the country as well as at many hospitals for training purposes and for patients themselves. To watch the trailer and learn more about this film visit: www.wrongwaytohope.com Mike's second film, a short film called Ebb & Flow: Storytelling for Cancer Survivors, evolved out of Mike's recognition that many cancer survivors do not realize that they have a story to tell or know where to start when telling their story. Using the five phase story structure, the film encourages survivors to view their lives as epic stories; stories that need to be told to others so that the wisdom gained from their journey will not be lost. This film has been used in over 22 special presentations and has given rise to many upcoming speaking and workshop invitations for Mike and Bonnie. To watch the entire short film visit: www.ebbflowstory.com ABOUT THE TEAM Mike Lang - Producer/Co-Director Mike is 28 years old and currently works for the Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary, Alberta as the CancerBridges Provincial Survivor Network Coordintor.

This story ran recently -- QA: ""'Spartacus' star Andy Whitfield's wife making doc about his fight with cancer"" http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/07/17/qa-partacus-star-andy-whitfield-widow-making-doc-about-his-fight-with-cancer Our Project: “Be Here Now” is an inspiring feature documentary and love story, about the overnight sensation, actor and international sex symbol Andy Whitfield, who put the same determination and dedication that he brought to his lead role in the hit television show, “Spartacus: Blood and Sand,” into fighting life threatening cancer.  This is Andy's story, but it also about having the courage to make your dreams come true, tackling your fears and living in the present, despite the potential outcome. This film is for anyone who has ever faced a challenge in their lives.  Andy Whitfield, in the prime of his life, had just realized his dream of becoming an international star, when he was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Before now, he and his eloquent and charismatic wife, Vashti, had combined their will power to make every success in their lives happen, including Andy’s transformation from an engineer into an actor and sex symbol. Overwhelmed when they heard that the best medical treatment the world had to offer would only give him a 25% chance for survival, they set their sites on beating cancer by making a promise in matching “Be Here Now” tattoos, to take Andy’s healing into their own hands and live life in the present, not in the shadows, every step of the way.  Not knowing what would happen, Andy invited a camera to follow him throughout his journey as he explores both medical and alternative healing option in Australia, New Zealand and India. This unprecedented access and his openness and honesty gives the audience an intimate look into his personal life, that is rarely shared, especially by a celebrity. It was Andy’s hope that by opening his story up to a documentary, he might help or inspire others facing similar challenges, while pushing to accelerate the pace of cancer research around the world.  What he did not anticipate was that the story would also capture his, and his family’s, determination, love, infectious humor and self-affirming attitudes. And, as everyone goes through their own transformations over the course of the film, “Be Here Now” transcends the subject of cancer and becomes a universal life-lesson about living fearlessly, going for your dreams, embracing each moment and living in the present – despite the potential outcome.  HOW YOU CAN HELP  You may now get involved in the making of this inspiring documentary. Led by the Academy Award® Nominated and multiple award winning filmmaker, Lilibet Foster, a camera followed Andy and his family’s unfolding story, for over a year. Andy also filmed personal diaries and took photographs throughout his journey. Together with the support of Sam Maydew, producer, Andy’s manager and principal of talent management and production company, The Collective, who brought everyone together, we have been able to get the documentary to this point. 
 We now need your help to finish it. The money we raise on Kickstarter will fund the additional filming and editing needed to finish the film. For your contributions, you will not only be rewarded with amazing, limited edition and collector's item gifts, but you will be helping to make Andy’s wish come true – to help or inspire others – because we plan to distribute the completed film as widely as possible internationally. 
 Andy gave selflessly by letting a camera follow his personal journey, so let's give back by helping fulfill the legacy the wanted to leave behind.  WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON’T REACH OUR GOAL  Kickstarter is the largest funding platform for creative projects in the world. The way it works is that we have to meet our funding goal before the campaign expires – or we don’t get anything.  We can only finish this documentary with your help. You are as much a part of its creation as we are. The more people who participate, the more ability we will have to get Andy’s story out to as many people as possible.  So, help by donating and spreading the word to others.

And of course it leaves its indelible mark or its stamp on you.” - Lalita Bharvani The Film Indelible Lalita tells a woman’s life story through her changing body. Born in India in 1948, Lalita Bharvani has lived in Bombay, Paris, and now Montréal; her body and identity have been remarkably transformed during this globalized life. Lalita’s dark complexion gradually lost its pigment due to a skin condition, so that she appears completely Caucasian. When she was 30, ovarian cancer left her unable to bear children. She is now fighting breast cancer and heart disease, as her mother lives out her last days in India. These health crises have robbed Lalita of a piece of her racial identity, her womanhood, and her youth. Yet somehow she joyfully adapts and re-defines herself at each stage. What It’s Really About 
I am using Lalita’s unique story to explore the idea of the body as an archive, onto which one’s experiences are recorded over the course of a life. Is the body somehow imprinted, like a passport getting stamped, by the places one lives? Does one’s identity derive from one’s physical appearance – or vice versa? Can the body be read as a record of all that has transpired in the soul within? While Lalita’s body has archived the pain of her life experiences, the film’s tone rises above victimhood because of Lalita’s resilience. A vibrant spark radiates from Lalita’s eyes even as her racial markers, her sexual organs, and her own heartbeat change. Shrugging off her problems, she remains centered by her Hindu faith and her strong relationships. Her joyful flexibility confirms the resilience of the female spirit in the face of inevitable bodily change. The Style 
The film visually portrays Lalita's body as a record of her life experiences and changing cultural identity. Extreme close-ups show parts of her body as she cooks, gets a massage, does yoga, and caresses her aging mother. “Life’s stamp” is revealed through bodily marks, medical documents, passport stamps, art prints, and patterns in nature. We see life's encounters make their mark on Lalita – and by extension, on every living thing. Current Status 
I began filming Lalita in October 2007, and have shot all of my material across three continents. I now have a late rough cut and am ready for the final push. With your support, I can complete the film by this summer. We Need Your Help! Indelible Lalita is an intimate, philosophical, artistic film – but unfortunately not one with a current events “hook” that attracts mainstream foundation funding. While my other films have received support from television and film sources, this one has been made largely with donated time and equipment. I am launching this Kickstarter campaign to raise money for the final sound editing and mix. I would like to bring the film’s delicate soundtrack up to the level of the visuals. If we can surpass our goal and raise $10,000, it will cover most of the final online edit as well. Your donations can help this film reach its full potential! ALL CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE TAX-DEDUCTIBLE. The non-profit Center for Independent Documentary will be accepting donations on my behalf.

I had to make it to an open mic on the other side of the 405. After signing up, I was forced to wait two hours to see if my name is drawn so I can perform three minutes of new material in front of an audience of seven. The stand-up’s life. I started questioning if this was worth missing the bedtime stories, snuggles and precious time with my snot-nosed little ones. That night it was worth it.  As I’m waiting for the inevitable, “Sorry, not tonight,” Quincy Jones, a vibrant young man covered in tattoos with giant holes in his earlobes bounces onto the scene. He scans the comic’s cliques. He sees me. A new face. His smile is larger than life. He beelines over and plops down in the empty seat next to me. Two hours flies by. I wasn’t even upset my name wasn’t chosen. Quincy’s was, and he was hilarious. The effervescent and jubilant personality that won me over is turned to an eleven out of ten when Quincy’s on stage. He will be a friend for life. I can tell. He’s special.  Doing stand-up comedy means you get to work with people you never would have met before. When would I have ever crossed paths with Quincy? I wouldn’t have met him in the school carpool lane or at toddler ballet class. I’m lucky I get to step out of my minivan and onto the makeshift plywood stages at microbrews. Quincy and I develop a friendship over the next year as we work the same stages, share thoughts and, most importantly, laughs.  Then I hear the news: Quincy is dying of cancer. My stomach drops. I call him. We meet at a show. He’s in the middle of chemotherapy while still hitting stages and making crowds laugh. Stand-up is getting him through the sickness. He’s been given one year to live. His stage-four Mesothelioma cancer is incurable.  I want to ask Quincy the age old question, what’s the one thing you want to do before you die. Before I can even ask, he tells me his last dream is to film an hour-long stand-up special. I blurt, “I can do that for you. I will make that happen.” Quincy stares at me. “Consider it done,” I assure him. His giant, larger-than-life smile returns. He’s speechless. He squeaks out a soft, barely audible, “Thank you.”  I return home after a long night at a seedy bar show. My husband, Mickey, has finished putting the kids to bed and is doing the dishes. I help empty the dishwasher. While stuffing plastic sippy cups into the cabinet like Tetris blocks I break the news to him. “Today I hung out with Quincy. He told me his last dream is to make a stand-up special. I told him I’d… we’d make him one. So… you okay to direct and shoot and edit and volunteer at least 200 hours of your precious time for a man you’ve never met?” Mickey doesn’t break his pace with the dishes, “Of course."" Mickey knows certain things are worth the time.  Quincy Jones is a Grammy winning American record producer, conductor, arranger, composer, musician, television producer, film producer, instrumentalist, magazine founder, entertainment company executive, and humanitarian. And he shares a name with this funny guy we know. Our Quincy Jones is a Los Angeles based comedian who can make any room fall in love with his craft, much like his namesake. Quincy moved to LA from Seattle to pursue a career in stand-up four years ago. Within his seven years of stand-up experience, Quincy has toured the country and played the best stages in LA, including shows with comedy legends like Bill Burr. In 2013 Quincy Jones was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of fame (while our Quincy was drinking a Chai with almond milk in a Korea Town coffee shop). On July 3, 2015 Quincy was diagnosed with stage-four Mesothelioma cancer. He was given one year to live. Quincy is currently not strong enough to work his regular barista day job; his energy can only last a few hours at a time. On nights that he is feeling well he makes sure to hit the stages around Los Angeles, spreading laughter, as he preps for this stand-up special film shoot. While on stage, Quincy is cancer free.  Mickey and Nicole Blaine have been a husband and wife producing team since their first show together while attending Loyola Marymount University in 1999. As Film, Television and Theater majors, the couple went on to produce, write and direct original theater, film, and television in Hollywood and New York. Pipe Dreams played to sold out audiences on tour in Los Angeles and at the New York International Fringe Festival in 2005. The Blaines returned 10 years later to FringeNYC with their long-running Los Angeles based stand-up show Virgin Sacrifice. The Blaines recently produced a television pilot based on Virgin Sacrifice, which is currently being shopped around town for distribution. They also produced two feature films, Commit (available on Amazon), and I’m Harry Clark. These films have won Best Film, Screenplay, Director, Actor and Audience Choice at over 50 film festivals worldwide. I’m Harry Clark was later adapted into a webseries and has won Best Comedy, Director, Writer, and Actor at some of the top web festivals across the country.  Cover Photo by Matt Misisco. Quincy lives alone in Los Angeles. He fights cancer alone. Quincy's goal has always been to reach people he doesn't know through laughter. Hundreds of comics make up his Los Angeles family, sharing the microphone with him each night he's on stage. It's time to give to the comic. Let's not let Quincy stand up alone. Your continued support will change his world and leave a legacy of laughter.  Mickey and I can’t produce this special by ourselves, which is scheduled to shoot on April 3, 2016 in Santa Monica, CA. We are humbled by the incredible crew members that have volunteered their time, or offered to work at extremely discounted rates! But we still need to raise money for the people who aren’t free and the equipment we don’t have or can’t borrow. The following budget is only possible because of volunteers, extremely reduced rates and donated equipment.  Production Fees and Rentals  Camera, Lighting, Sound: $2,250  Facility/Location Charge: $135  Food for the crew: $200  Post Production: $1,500  Kickstarter %, Rewards + Shipping: $500 Misc (issues always arise on productions): $400  Total: $4,985  There is no way we could produce this special without the volunteered hours of our amazingly talented and generous crew members. Our incredible cinematographer, Terrance Stewart, whom we have worked with multiple times, will bring a three person camera crew and rent additional equipment. We have recruited two professional sound technicians to insure the sound is recorded and mixed properly. This breakdown of costs is our bare minimum to make the special happen. Any money raised beyond our goal will first and foremost go into enhancing the production and post production of the special to ensure the highest quality and quickest turnaround (It’s important that Quincy gets to see the final product). After all of the production and postproduction has been paid for, any additional money raised will go to reimburse the creative people involved who were volunteering their time, including Quincy himself.  Every dollar helps make Quincy's last dream of shooting a stand-up special a reality. Thank you is an understatement. We feel incredibly moved by your generosity.  If you contribute $25 or more you will be provided a digital download of the comedy special once clearance has been granted by potential distribution deals!  If you contribute $50 or more you will receive 5 bracelets hand designed by Quincy himself! Quincy and the incredible company Bead Relief, have teamed up to thank you, our fellow supporters! Wear the bracelets to STAND-UP together for Quincy's last dream.  Both Mickey and Nicole Blaine are honored and excited to work with the talented Quincy Jones and fulfill his lifelong dream of shooting a stand-up special on April 3, 2016. Quincy has been doing stand-up for seven years. Lucky comics often get their “big break” in comedy after the ten year benchmark. Quincy doesn’t have the time to wait. The Blaines are determined to make him an incredible special that will live on past the time he was given. The hour-long special will be a gift to his devoted mother, family, friends, comics that know and love him, fellow cancer fighters and their loved ones. Once complete, the Blaines will use the connections that have secured them distribution deals, and meetings with top companies, to guarantee that Quincy’s special can reach a larger audience.  Please donate now.  Please SHARE this project with your community. With your help, we can make Quincy Jones’s last dream a reality.  Please help spread the laughter.

Where 10% of our ticket sales will be donated to stupidcancer.org,2012-04-30 19:14:20,2012-09-04 22:40:36,2012-10-04 22:40:36,14100,True,False,1,113,14155.0,14155.0,USD,USD,1.0,dance_theater,US,NY,Town,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/athena/the-man-under-off-broadway?ref=category_newest,"What if you wanted to say “I love you” but you couldn’t? What if life and its circumstances were preventing you from leading the life you really wanted? The Man Under is an urban love story about four people in New York City who struggle with what they want and how to express it.

Jeff, Martin and Jennifer are longtime friends who can’t quite move past the past. They aren’t able to say what they really feel and are stuck in a rut of their own. This all changes when Jeff meets Lisa, a young, fiery and unpredictable sexpot he runs into on a subway platform.  She turns everything upside down, sparking momentous change in each of their lives. By the end of the play, our characters have a whole new world to look forward to, understanding more deeply who they are and what they strive to be. The Man Under is a dark comedy that handles the serious themes of home, loss, love, cancer, secrets, thought and impulse – everyday issues for everyday characters in extraordinary circumstances. In short, it’s about what is said and unsaid in our relationships and how we choose to connect with those we love or want to love. The action takes place in and under present day New York City. Original drafts of the play showed tremendous potential, and Athena Theatre decided to begin work in earnest on developing the play. We had our sights set on producing at 59E59 Theaters, what has become, in just ten years, the destination for new work Off-Broadway. We submitted the script, and 59E59 was interested. Now we needed to do a reading of the play and explore the complex balance of humor and sincerity with an extremely talented cast. We were able to fund the reading by successfully completing a Kickstarter campaign (an on-line fundraising platform designed to support artists and creative endeavors (www.kickstarter.com). The Man Under received a staged reading Monday, January 30, 2012 at Primary Stages, in Manhattan. The feedback was very positive. The audience laughed, cried, as well as contacted us afterwards expressing how much they related to the story and look forward to the seeing the production fully staged. One of the audience members was Nina Segal, Literary Associate at 59E59 Theaters. The strong response from the reading was instrumental in our being accepted for 59E59’s 2013 season.

After conversations with Elysabeth Kleinhans, Artistic Director of 59E59, several rounds of re-writes, another private reading, and conversations about how the play could be marketed by the theater, we were offered the Jan. 21- Feb 17 timeslot in Theater C at 59E59.

59E59’s staff were impressed with how much humor and heart were portrayed when the play was read aloud. And although the theatre is extremely selective with the plays they choose, The Man Under was selected from among a field of many applicants. Working closely with 59E59’s artistic team has helped us get the play ready for both their subscribers and a wider audience.
 We come to Kickstarter again to help raise funds for our Rent at the amazing 59E59 Theaters; Insurance; Designer Stipends, Materials and Incidentals. We have raised $10K so we are well on our way! Check out our perks, donate a buck (or as much as you can) and we look forward to seeing you at the theatre. I could not think of a better gift for Athena's 10th Birthday!!! I'M TOO YOUNG FOR THIS! The Man Under is a play that deals heavily with the aftermath of the death of a young woman. She suffers from and succumbs to her illness. Our play can be seen as a play about health, and one way we feel we can make a difference is by using our art to help others. We've recently joined forces with Stupid Cancer, an organization that provides support for young people living with cancer. And just like the 71 people who have pledged to support our play, we've also decided to make a pledge.  Athena Theatre Company will donate 10% of our box office from The Man Under to Stupid Cancer in an effort to reach beyond the (what can sometimes seem insular) scope of theater and make an impact on people in our community. Here's a little information about the organization we've teamed up with: Young adults, a largely unknown group in the war on cancer, account for 72,000 new diagnoses each year. That's one every eight minutes. It's also seven times more all than pediatric cancers. This is not OK! Stupid Cancer (aka The I'm Too Young For This! Cancer Foundation, i[2]y) is a non-profit organization that empowers young adults affected by cancer through innovative and award-winning programs and services. We are the nation's largest support community for this underserved population and serve as a bullhorn for the young cancer movement. Their charter is to ensure that no one goes unaware of the age-appropriate resources they are entitled to so they can get busy living. Hopefully The Man Under can not only provide some funding to Stupid Cancer, but more importantly, increase awareness for this amazing organization.",125.26548672566372,879,45,1.0039007092198582,30.0,9,1,2012,1,1,23,general,1,0,1,0,0.0011376564277588168,0.0,0.8413945989520355,5.725187597247955,0.0,kickstarter

Partnering with non-profit orginization Come&Live!, we asked ourselves a strange question—what if we gave our records away for free? We did just that. Tens of thousands of copies of our last album Who Can Know It? were downloaded—for free—all over the world. We went further and decided to tour to support the record and not charge for the concerts either. For a year, we traveled to 9 different countries, encouraging people to have our album as a free gift. Wherever we went and wherever the record was played a simple message was proclaimed: Jesus is alive, he's in love with you, and hope, freedom and truth are all yours in him. We're ready to do the same things—on an even bigger scale—with a new album in 2012.  Cancer is a long-gestating idea that we've toyed with for years, but never had the resources to adequately accomplish our vision. A science-fiction concept album with an elaborately detailed universe fleshed out with music, lyrics, visual art and a movie. The landscape of our last concept album, Anorexia Nervosa, was... grand. We want to go bigger. Much bigger. An intricate world of a story set to the soundtrack of a Raw Rock space opera and accompanied by it's own feature film! We want to gather/combine all our creative resources into telling a massive, multi-sensory extravaganza of a story that screams an incredible truth: Jesus has conquered death! We want to do all this and then give it away. For free.  Of course, you can't give a record away for free on a giant record label... but then, without a giant record label, you have to find some way to pay for the whole thing. And this crazy idea is a crazily expensive idea. That's why we need you... again. We're not terribly preoccupied with how the music industry will survive or where it will go. We learned a lot with the last album fundraiser about what to do and what not to do. But most of all, we learned (again) that God is generous and so are you guys. You're outstanding and overwhelming kindness literally carried our message and our hope all over the world again and again. You are our brothers and our sisters. You are our family. As was the case last time, without your help this vision will not come to be. Let's come together again and declare that the kingdom of darkness, death and despair is defeated.

THE FILM An extraordinary story of sacrifice takes place one ordinary afternoon when a young engineer, Dustin Harper, visits his longtime friend, Brady Collins. Their ongoing game of chess is brought to a halt when Brady reveals that his continuing battle with cancer has taken a turn for the worst. The only thing harder than saying goodbye will be honoring Brady’s last request. Principal photography for KNIGHT TO D7 is slated for late July in the Los Angeles area. After editing, scoring, sound finishing, and color correction, K2D7 will go out on the film festival circuit. For more information, please visit our website: www.K2D7movie.com THE INSPIRATION Cancer is one of the unfortunate realities of the 21st century. Most of us have a story about how cancer has affected our lives, whether it be directly or indirectly. Parents, grandparents, siblings, friends—sitting by and watching this disease rob the people we love of their lives is never an easy thing. As a team of filmmakers, we asked ourselves, ""What can we do to make a difference?"" The answer was clear: make a movie that gives a voice to people with similar experiences and supports the campaign to find a cure. Although we don't have a lot of money, haven’t spent our lives earning a medical degree, and are not legislators impacting research agendas, filmmaking holds the incredible potential to inspire, uplift, and empower people in a way no other medium can. It is because of this power that the team feels a responsibility to tell this story. KNIGHT TO D7 is a way to honor those bravely battling this horrible disease and a way to remind people everywhere about the beauty of the human experience. HOW WE'LL USE THE MONEY It's no secret that making movies costs money. In Hollywood, 100 million dollars can be spent on a superhero film without anyone batting an eye. Cast, crew, equipment, locations, and props. . . these things add up quick. In KNIGHT TO D7, we don't have Spider-Man rescuing Mary Jane from the top of a bridge or Batman defending Gotham against the Joker; however, we do have a film about a hero. Your donations will go directly to the production of KNIGHT TO D7. Whether your gift is used to buy a costume, rent a light, or feed our team, we promise that we will honor it by making a film that you can be proud of. Our team specializes in making every dollar stretch as far as possible while not sacrificing the quality of the end product. We need to raise $15,000 in order to shoot our film. Once we get it in the can and edit a rough cut, we hope to use the footage to secure funding for post production, publicity, and film festivals. With your help, we look forward to making our movie about a different kind of hero. We humbly recognize that your donations are a gift and we thank you in advance for partnering with us to make this story come to life. THE CAST ANGELO SALVATORE RESTAINO as ""Dustin Harper""

Brace yourselves for ""Americancer."" We are currently in the final stages of production for this album. The tracks have been sent off to Chicago, IL to Glitch Mode Studios, where the amazing Sean Payne, mastermind of Cyanotic, is already about halfway done with the final mixes.  Your contributions will be going toward the album production costs, finishing the album art, as well as making physical CD's. Everything exceeding our goal of $1,500 will go towards producing band merchandise, improving our live shows via additional lighting/costuming/equipment, as well as improvements to our studio space.

Infidels back cover blurb: Boyd Russell is a normal dude. High school graduate. Film projectionist. Sports desk intern. Parental lawn care specialist. Drug runner...and rest assured, when Boyd grumbles about his 'fucking cottonmouth' he is not talking about fornicating snakes. When he wakes up one Sunday and finds himself about to blow his wad of drug money on a guilt offering to the church, it's time to rehash his choices and figure out what's next. Torn between loyalty for a boyhood friend in a battle against cancer and the hazardous thrills of a drug-addled rust belt city, Boyd's problems piled up like butts in an ash tray, but he barely noticed because he was too busy going with the flow (he even missed a booty call that he used to live for). Now he has to decide whether it's too late for him, or if he can find a way to rise above--and stay there. *** Infidels character teasers: Boyd: http://www.savagenoble.com/2012/06/06/boyd-russell-drug-runner-character-sample/ Jack: http://www.savagenoble.com/2012/06/06/jack-moral-compass-character-sample/ Holly: http://www.savagenoble.com/2012/06/06/holly-former-booty-call/ Rey: http://www.savagenoble.com/2012/06/06/rey-character-sample/ Marty: http://www.savagenoble.com/2012/06/06/marty-rich-skater-kid-character-sample/ What is Infidels? 300 pages of literary fiction, as much a drug-fueled romp through a pristine countryside as a meditation on human strength and frailty. It's also a new business model, a prototype for grassroots publishing. I wrote Infidels, I got it edited through a personal network of professionals and scholars, I want to print it at a local short-run printer, and I want to fund and distribute it by crowd-sourcing on Kickstarter. It's the best deal on Kickstarter for fiction publishing: $20 Pledge + Successful Campaign = You Own A Copy Of This Book  Think of it more as reserving your copy than a pledge. You're not pledging money for me to take off work for two months and ""write the book"", where a $150 pledge gets you a copy of the book. I've already done the dirty work. Writing, editing, cover art. Now I'm raising money to fund the actual printing and shipping of Infidels. The novel is ready. Pledges fund: 1. Small kickstarter fees. 2.
Printing, shipping. $3,000 per short run. I want to do two runs. I found a great local short-run printer that's giving me a deal on printing. That's good business, bang for your grassroots buck. Paying cover artist, framing painting. Contracting stickers and E-book. Editing services and fees. 3.

As a presenter in the forthcoming 2013 ArtPrize in Grand Rapids, Michigan, I will be using my photography to tell the story of my daughter's struggle with and her eventual winning of her battle with Leukemia (ALL). Once barely known to us, Grand Rapids quickly became the center of our lives as she underwent treatment over a three-year period. Spending well over a hundred days in the hospital and many hours on the road traveling back and forth to the Devos Children's Hospital, I thought this would be an appropriate venue for the project. The work is entitled ""Strong,"" and shows the strength one can pull from within one's self when required. The background for the project will be pink fabric formed into a Superman 'S' for ""Strong"" and ""Sarah."" The photos will be placed at various points on the 'S.' The first photos will portray Sarah before she was diagnosed with cancer -- in color and printed on a metal backing. The photos will become larger and eventually turn to black and white, printed on canvas, as they move into the chemotherapy part of her journey. Once the chemo is over, the photos will go back to color, printed on metal, and become smaller and smaller. There are two items that Sarah wore during the chemo process - a ""turtle shell"" used to protect the nine fractures in her spine caused by the ALL, and a hat that she created during the first days in the hospital. These objects will be photographed, placed over the original objects, and sprayed with a shellac to harden them. The finished 3D photos will then be placed in the 'S' curves. The final product will be hung in the Cafe San Chez from September 16- October 8, 2013.

God, Grant Me centers around Lea, a hopelessly romantic pill addict filled with anxiety. Lea goes through a bad breakup with her long term boyfriend, Adam, at the beginning of the movie and in a last ditch effort to get Adam back, she decides to get clean and go to NA. After stumbling into a cancer support group Lea runs into Silus, a cancer survivor currently in remission. Sick at a young age and distanced from his mother, Silus, has a pervasively apathetic attitude towards life. Silus and Lea are, in a way, kindred yet very different characters. Where Lea sees life as too romantic and picturesque, Silus sees life in a jaded and meaningless fashion. In the end they both find a balance in their outlooks.  The story is crafted along the beliefs that only through human connection can we achieve any personal growth. Incorporating traditional themes and modern realism God, Grant Me brings something new to the film world. With a mixture of awkward moments, witty remarks, and true glimpses at humanity the film delivers a plethora of emotion to the audience. UPDATE! To further prove just how awesome this film is, here is the First Act of the film! Jesse McGinness and Will Friederich, the Directors and Writers of this film, are originally from Kansas City (there’s one in Kansas and one in Missouri. It’s confusing, we know). Both reside in Lawrence, KS. They are students of film, one through KU and the other in a non-traditional sense. Being young college kids, Jesse and Will are both more broke than the Apollo 13 space shuttle (too soon?). All jokes aside, Jesse and Will are super passionate and proud of this film, and want you (and everyone else) to see it. In order for this movie to be made, they need your help!  Ali Peterson, the adorkable and talented female lead, Lea, is a pretty swell gal. Born and raised in small town Kansas, Ali is currently attending the University of Kansas (Rock Chalk). Her and Jesse McGinness have been best friends since eighth grade where they met at Worlds of Fun at the height of their teenage angst. Now out of that stage of life, they have successfully moved on to young adult angst. Ali brings a sense of realism and a lighthearted awkward humor to the role of Lea that audiences are sure to connect with.  Nick Johnson, playing the role of Silus, is the most handsome man this side of the Mississippi. Drawing comparisons to the likes of Johnny Depp, and Heath Ledger; Nick still manages to keep a level head. The directors knew he was perfect for the role when they ran into him at a coffee shop and saw him reading the collected work of Anton Chekhov. A native son of Kansas, Nick brings a classically trained element to this film, and will certainly be great in the role of Silus.  Andrew Shepherd, Director of Photography, is an incredibly talented individual. At the age of 18, Andrew had already started his own production company, Popmuse, and was actively pursuing a career in filmmaking. Coming from a background of concert filming, Andrew brings a distinctly innovative, yet pleasing, style to the silver screen.  Jackson Swain, Sound Technician, is one of the coolest dudes you’ll ever meet if you ever meet him. Jackson is a talented musician and all around renaissance man. Currently attending film school at the University of Kansas, Jackson hopes to make a career out of making movies.  Ramon Williamson is a highly accomplished self-help author and one of the nicest guys you’ll meet. Playing the role of the Support Group Leader, Ramon will be able to bring some realism to his performance. Follow us on respective social medias! First off, this movie is going to be great.

There are so many hoops, roadblocks, and hurdles one has to jump through in order for a movie to be made. It takes an odd mixture resilience and stubbornness. We as a cast have already come up against many of these roadblocks, and are certain to come up against many more. We are continuously learning what it takes to produce a film, and we are learning ways to make the process easier. One very simple task is, for lack of better words, just keeping at it.

With the sudden arrival of his long lost ‘ladies man’ dad, and a with a new love in his life, will Aaron get back on track to recovery or simply fade away before he can make it into rock history. I wanted to write this film to bring up the hard topics that a large amount of people can relate to, the struggles of living in povertized Britain and of dealing with cancer. But I wanted to display them in a light hearted, comedic fashion. Why pledge to this project? We need your help to tell this inspiring story to the world. We believe it's an important message about how people really live in the U.K. and how difficult a struggle it can be living with cancer. It'll be entertaining  and all of course.   Why do we need the money? We need £3000, we realise in the grand scheme of a feature this is next to nothing, you couldn't even buy a decent guitar with that. The thing is, we don't need a lot, we have acquired a lot of the equipment through working freelance over the years and we specialise in budget filmmaking, we know how to create something spectacular out of nothing. Everybody working on this project is working for free, we have a lot of skill, talent, passion and love going into this film but not a lot  of money. The money we raise will be used on transport, props and costumes, extra equipment hire and every penny pledged will go a long way in improving the quality of the film. JAMES BUTLER - CINEMATOGRAPHER Our darling Cinematographer, James Butler , is the one of THE most promising young talents at work in the film industry today. Armed with an insatiable brain for technology as well as dazzling eye for cinematic style, this guy is definitely one to watch. Having honed his knowledge in the depths of CBS London News office, he went from strength to strength shooting commercials and most recently a critically acclaimed short film SALT where he manipulated the new Black Magic Cinema camera to achieve results never seen before by the camera community and the Black Magic company itself. We are very fortunate to have him at the helm of the camera department for South of the River. James will be tackling this project in a way that hasn’t yet been exploited by feature films in the past. A very exciting new approach to film making. Cant wait to see the final results! Rupert Hopkins - Cameraman  Rupert has been part of the team for the last three years, camera operating for short films Bloodlust and Justly Vengeful. He has an excessive taste for all camera equipment and technology which has helped him in gaining a keen eye for composition and framing. It’s his natural adaptability and quick thinking in problem solving that makes him an asset to the team. Amelia Hansson - Producer Amelia is our extremely talented and multi skilled producer. She has been running the show behind the scenes for countless hi end productions from commercials to corporate training videos. Her skills extend beyond production to directing, editing and even international relations where she started out at the London School of Economics. A great trait to have as a film producer. We are extremely lucky to have her onboard keeping everything on track and making South of the River go as far as possible.  The music is a big part of this project an album has been written and a band has been hand picked and assembled to create ""The Undefined"".

Currently, we have some very special people sitting on our board including cancer survivors, photographers, business owners and the list goes on.

The amount we are asking for is to purchase tools that we will be using to get the foundation up and running. This is not a one-time shot; we are dedicating our lives to help the lives of others in need. However, we don’t want to stop at the $10,000 range, we want to go above and beyond. This has been a life time goal and with your help, we can make this a reality.

WHAT WE DO?

We have a special studio that will travel to children’s hospitals, child cancer centers, and hospitals. For too many families, the portrait is the last one they have of their child. Our studio is not stopping there! We want to give the gift of love to all children and families with cancer or who have become terminally ill. By focusing on the child, we put cancer in the background. 
What people don't understand is how this effects the whole family. Brothers and sisters of cancer patients often face fear, anxiety, changes in daily routines, worry, grief and even jealousy as their family is thrown into the emotional turmoil of managing a child’s cancer treatment. This is a way for us to get the whole family together for a day full of fun
. Our special studio is made up of highly skilled photographers most of which are PPA approved. We have several makeup and hair stylists that have donated their time to the children and families. We need your help to jump start the foundation so we can start the process of giving. Flashes of Love Foundation will be working year round offering special events, suit and tie events, fundraisers, and working with other charities to offer our services to help the cause.  We basically took our studio and split it into several locations to offer more to the public, help families in time of need and put a smile on a lot of children's faces.  OTHER PROGRAMS OFFERED:   These services will be offered through our business, Andersen Studio LLC  -Remembrance Services
     Remembrance services are offered 24/7. During the

I have the generous participation of the director and some of the actors from the successful 1997 original production who will be involved in the 2012 production along with a multi-ethnic and generational cast, set designer, and tech staff.   The best way to introduce you to this very special human being is to share with you the obituary he wrote for himself when he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia: MORT LEVYLEVY, MORT, 77, a Center City resident. I, Morton Levy (Dec. 22, 1933-Sept. 13, 2011), invite all who would celebrate my life to do so by hugging a child, helping a stranger, or remembering to say I love you to someone special. I died after a long battle with non-hodgkins lymphoma complicated by a second cancer, acute myeloid leukemia. Nevertheless, mine was a rich, adventurous life filled with far more good times than bad. I was world traveler, Navy veteran, scuba diver, playwright, martial artist, and occasional actor. I was English professor, writer, and social worker. I was avid naturalist, bird watcher, and someone infinitely curious about life. I was especially proud to be a card-carrying liberal and staunch supporter of civil rights. In short, my death completes a wondrous journey, including 26 years of love, laughter, and bumps in the road with life-partner, Julie Hirsch Waxman, who made me incrediably happy. I leave behind her children and mine. Hers: sons David and Jeremy Waxman, granddaughter Mildred Waxman, plus ""spare grandson"" Onenasit Alex Inchote. Mine: son Erik Levy, daughter Emiko Levy, son-in-law Steve Giuliano, and grandson Jake Giuliano, all of whom enriched my life far more than I did theirs. Other survivers include a brother, Sidney Levy, and sister-in-law, Audrey Levy; a sister, Haralyn Silberg, and brother-in-law, Hillel Silberg. Plus numerous nieces and nephews. In making room for others, I have opted for cremation and having my ashes scattered in a nature setting, but wish to announce that if reincarnation exists I plan to return as a hawk. Look for me.Published in the Philadelphia Inquirer & Philadelphia Daily News on September 16, 2011. The impetus to revive Mort's play is my way of celebrating this remarkable man, whom I profoundly miss. When I put the suggestion out to Ty Collins, the original director of REPLACING HARRY, there was not one hesitation to again embark on this theatrical journey, and many of the original cast agreed to participate as well. Ironically, we were the first theatrical production at Second Stage at the Adrienne in Philadelphia, and may well be their last.  Of particular note: Mort played the role of Harry in the original production, so the poignancy of the title is not lost upon us.                                   MortHawk Productions, LLC presents REPLACING HARRY, an American love tale by the late Mort Levy. It is a comedy of marriage and monarchy played out in America. While Harry is dying the race is on to see who will succeed him. Will the ambitous black Queen Julia have her way?  REPLACING HARRY tells a tale of marriage and politics...""in that blistering season when King Harry and Queen Julia crossed swords...with a vengeance..."" My reason for reviving REPLACING HARRY is partly personal and is also a way to share with the theater-going audience Mort's remarkable playwriting skills. There are three other plays written by Mort waiting to be produced. Your financial support will help ensure that REPLACING HARRY can once again be produced in its original home with a unique multi-ethnic and multi-generational cast. Mort Levy has left an impressive legacy, which I wish to share. Please join me.

Kyle is a humble artist in Dallas. I first met Kyle at his own event and didn't even know he was performing until he got on stage. Even as a stranger, he welcomed me with open arms and introduced me to his friends be cause he saw me standing alone. He had no idea I was there to scout talent for that event.  I kept in touch with kyle and came to more of his small time performances because he is a character and he really gets the crowd going. Unfortunately, I was at the last event his mother attended and it was a memorable one to say the least. She was glowing with pride and showed almost no signs of illness.  GOAL: We plan to produce a 10 to 12 song album by August. I have contacted a producer, Jesse Irokwe, to help me. I have also received endorsements from Kaos2, Severe, and 2 Kold Syndicate to feature on the album. These are very big names in Dallas and we are very appreciative to have them. They understand the emotional value this holds and are willing to complete this project. We also have Sound Wave Media Studios on board so professional equipment will be fully accessible.  I plan to update this project as often as I can and keep everyone in the loop as this is going to be a very emotional process for everyone.

The three man crew embarking on this journey has been preparing for almost a full year now. We are all film majors from Columbia College Chicago. The director and creative producer will be graduating May 18th, 2014. This is the same day we hope to be successfully funded. The cinematographer graduated last year. We all have been closely affected by cancer. Below is a mini bio on our cancer connection and how we have been training. Creative Producer, Evan Bartlett was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia when he was 14 weeks old. A few years ago he found out that the doctors gave him a 1% chance to live. He is now 21 years cancer free. He has done a few bike tours, trained in southern Illinois, and Florida. He decided to couch surf with strangers his last semester of school. So far he has been living out of one bag for 2 ½ months. Testing out various couch surfing sites, and promoting the project to random people/classmates. He has no lease. No keys. Just one bag. Director, Tim Jacks has been a bike messenger in Chicago for over a year. While everyone was inside for the second snowpocalypse he was outside riding. His mother is a 6 year breast cancer survivor, and his grandmother passed away in November due to ovarian cancer. We have incorporated teal in various ways since it represents ovarian cancer. He will be spreading his grandmother’s ashes along the way. Cinematographer, Zach Cieslak was originally going to bike across America with a close friend. The only available time to do this would of jeopardized him from graduating. He chose to graduate. Evan and Tim instantly called him once they caught wind of his story. Zach’s younger cousin is a cancer survivor. It was the families first time dealing with cancer.

Let’s help steal back some joy in food, and win little battles with taste while doctors fight the war. As featured on NowThis: Why is this needed?  Doctors are so focused on treatment (rightfully so!), warning people about taste is often overlooked. We’re in the camp where that’s unacceptable. So, meet our cookbook project. We are tackling where cancer steals joy. We can help in the kitchen. To solve the immediate problem, we enlisted award-winning chefs from across the country with the single mission to tackle taste. The Chemo Kitchen Cookbook is a compilation of recipes created by them.  Delicious dishes for people in treatment, sure, but the cookbook also provides an opportunity and place for the outpouring of support from people who want to help and just make a dish or two. The food community is already full of passion. The desire to teach, help, mend and learn was immediately obvious when we tested the recipes during our very first test kitchen. Simply, reviews were outstanding. It worked! We want to get the cookbook in the hands of the caregivers, patients, and warriors in remission.  Our ask is simple. We need funding to help build our first digital and hardcover cookbook. We need your support to get the cookbook printed and distributed.  The need for upfront funding and this Kickstarter came from a desire to make this cookbook affordable so that it can be easily accessed by anyone who needs it. Print on demand makes it expensive. This is an issue because we are dreaming bigger than just a cookbook.  Eventually we would like to build a community to give back to cancer research and patient care. The one stop shop online for people going through taste change caused by chemotherapy.  This is all just a pipe dream until we can get cookbooks in the hands of people who need them. The cookbook is square one. But man, we get excited dreaming about what the next steps will be!  Fund us today and join in our mission to bring joy into the life of someone with cancer. The more we raise, the better deals we get on printing and better opportunity we have to spread the word. It’s all about community and we want you to be part of ours!  About a year ago, we started gathering recipes for the cookbook— we’ve now collected more than 50 compelling recipes from 30 award-winning chefs. The outpouring of support from the food world has been overwhelming!  The video, branding, book and cover design was created in generous partnership with Wexley School for Girls. They understand that going through chemotherapy is a drag (to say the least) and have created a brand look that is intentionally joyful and whimsical.  The Hot Stove Society, a Tom Douglas cooking school, welcomed us to prepare and test meals in their teaching kitchens for both people going through chemotherapy and their caregivers.  Canlis (which is continually rated one of the top restaurants in Seattle) opened exclusively for a test kitchen lunch with their award winning chef  Brady Williams sampling his recipes.  The amazing team at America's Test Kitchen has been incredibly generous with their advice and recipes. Their support is a great feather in our cap. Additional advisers include Blake Mycoskie, the founder of Tom’s shoes, the Virginia Mason Medical Center, and countless resources both in treatment centers and support groups. That said, we hope this is just the beginning. Left to right: Phil Abbess, Tara Cooke, Cal McAllister, Michelle Abbess, Amy Lower, Rob Scherzer, Jamie Roemer. Busy working hard: Shelby Kindem. UNLOCKED! $10,000 raised—we’ll make the book spiral bound so it can stand up easily during cooking.  UNLOCKED: $30,000 raised—we’ll make the book wipeable for easy cleaning. Why wipeable?

Of all the things in the kitchen that should be sturdy enough to survive splashes and spills, it’s this book.  With your generous backing we envision a bright and generous future. ",133.40255591054313,712,51,1.043875,54.73096064814815,6,6,2018,1,1,17,general,2,0,2,0,0.0028089887640449437,0.0,0.07439404847612191,10.487171557255454,0.0,kickstarter

–Rumi  The Project:
	This project “Mary”, 2014, steel, 8’–0” X 8’-0” x 7’-0”, ¾”, approximately 2,400 lbs. became personal for I lost a friend a 
few years ago to breast cancer, she was 40 years old. Recently I had a dream about her and this sculpture, and immediately 
made a sketch, conceptual drawings and produced a model over the following days. 

	My plan is to acquire financing and locate a permanent location in the United States with the help of the Kickstarter 
community. The final memorial location must be open to the public, outdoors and in a large city; my preference would be 
Dallas, TX, the location of the Susan G. Komen headquarters (Note: I am not affiliated with the Susan G. Komen charity), 
Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Washington etc. are all acceptable and the sculpture will be donated free of charge, there will be a mandatory site visit by me and simple engineering requirements to make the site able to accept the weight 
of the sculpture. Once this project is successfully financed, I will send the site requirements to those interested parties 
identified by the Kickstarter community by e-mail.   The Process:
	The entire process should be completed by September 2014.  • 	Rough sketch (completed 1/2014) • 	Conceptual drawings (completed 1/2014)
• 	Make a model (completed 1/2014)
• 	Conceptual photographs (completed 1/2014)
• 	Cost estimate
(completed 2/2014)• 	Funding (Kickstarter)
• 	Fabricate a ½ scale model. Due to the complexities of the angles and bends in this sculpture, the fabrication shop and 
	I will produce a ½ scale model from 3/8” thick steel. This will produce a steel bending plan and customized methods 
	to eliminate any unforeseen problems in the completion of the final large sculpture.  • 	Prime, paint ½ scale model
• 	Order the custom 3/4” steel for the final sculpture memorial
• 	Fabricate the full size sculpture memorial
• 	Prime, paint the full size sculpture memorial
• 	Load onto a flat bed tractor-trailer and delivery to the selected sculpture memorial location  * A rigging and crane service will be required for installation at the sculpture memorial location. 	U.S. Breast Cancer Statistics: 
About 1 in 8 U.S. women (just under 12%) will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. In 2013, there were more than 2.8 million women with a history of breast cancer in the U.S. This includes woman currently being treated 
and women who have finished treatment (http://www.breastcancer.org).

It was 2007 and the recession was just beginning to take hold. Darian was in an industry that was hit early and hard, struggling in a minimum wage job working 70+ hours a week. Heather was working a few hours a week in a local quilt shop and occasionally using their longarm to quilt her own quilts. A customer asked one of the owners for a 'longarmer' and Heather was recommended. Although she didn't know it at the time, Heather quilted that quilt and Heather Spence Designs was born.Originally named Top to Bottom Custom Quilting we got a loan for Heather's own machine and put it in the master bedroom of our home, and off she went.  Then Heather's mom, Irene, was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. And we lost our house. In December of 2009 we moved in with Heather's parents just as Irene finished her first round of treatments. With no room for her machine a generous customer offered the use of her basement. It might have been a 45 minute drive, one way, but it kept the business going.Darian had a new job by this time and in early 2011 they were able to rent a small 1000 square foot apartment for their family of 4. And they managed to fit the longarm machine in it. Irene was still a cancer patient, and was scheduled for a stem cell transplant in late 2011. Insurance fully covered the procedure but Irene would still need full-time care, housing near the hospital and basic living expenses. Heather's father, Bob, was going to be the care giver. Fundraising was needed.Heather Spence Designs moved from providing for her own family unit, to helping others with needs.As her family likes to call it, Heather's Idea Hamster had been working overtime. She had created, written and made her very first original quilt pattern. About the same time Irene and Bob's neighbor Dan, a firefighter in Renton, WA, was training to complete the Scott Firefighter Stair Climb of the Columbia Tower in Seattle, WA. Each year hundreds of firefighters climb 69 flights of stairs to raise funds for the fight against Lymphoma & Leukemia. That year Dan climbed in Irene's honor.  Dan's Climb and Mystery Quilt for a Cause was born.  Heather organized her pattern into six clues which were sent to participants one at a time for six consecutive weeks. The participants didn't know what it would look like until the end. It was great fun.For Dan's Climb, Heather had about 80 participants and raised $800 for her mom. After Irene, came Sandee, and then Jack, followed by Wyatt. Heather created Sandee's Stained Glass, Jack of Hearts and Connect the Dots. As more money was raised and more needs were met, more opportunities were being presented. It was becoming a challenge to help. And as the fundraising was done personally, the cost to us was ever increasing. Heather found www.cancercare.org a non-profit that was already successfully working with cancer patients to help provide their basic needs. Beginning with Mums the Word, then Elevation and Check it Out, Mystery Quilt for a Cause (MQFC) has raised almost $10,000 for CancerCare. There is a new quilt scheduled for this fall that we anticipate being just as successful. Heather Spence Designs (HSD) has always desired to help others. Through all the MQFC's, Heather has not taken a dime to cover any of her significant expenses. Time, pattern writing, software, mass email costs, photography, taxes, graphic designers, printing to name just a few have all come from HSD.MQFC is getting huge. The Elevation Mystery Quilt, with the help of The Missouri Star Quilt Co, www.missouriquiltco.com had about 4000 participants.  Remember the Idea Hamster? Well over the past 5 years Heather has written 13 original Quilt patterns. Each time that she presents a new MQFC, new participants look at the previous patterns, and want those too. Through self publishing HSD has been able to print some of the patterns and sell them through the www.heatherspencedesigns.com website. More participants are creating more demand, and more quilt stores are finding out about HSD and Mystery Quilt. Distributing patterns is not something that you can just wade into. We've discovered that you have to jump into the deep end, and hope you can swim. Each year www.quilts.com holds the International Quilt Market, the USA's largest wholesale trade show for the quilt industry. HSD is going to Market to launch the original quilt patterns, and showcase Mystery Quilt for a Cause. Through your support we will cover the upfront costs of going to Market. But it's so much more than that. By going to market you are supporting us to continue the mission of providing for the basic needs of cancer patients. Today, as we launch our Kickstarter Project, Irene is officially cancer free, the Stem Cell Transplant was successful, and she has overcome the hurdles that go along with being a transplant patient. Although that original $800 raised by Heather may not have covered all of Irene's needs back in 2011, it was a huge part of her success story.

I'm hoping that it will gain investors and ultimately have someone do a professional run of the show.  ******************************************************************************************** Like many of us or those we know, my life has been changed by cancer. Right after turning 30, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer. My wife and I had been struggling with the decision to start a family when suddenly the debate took on a new urgency. After two operations, we thought our ordeal was over, but six months later, the cancer returned. I had another major operation and many rounds of chemotherapy. Aggressively trying to beat the disease, we also struggled to bring a new life into the world. During this difficult time, I wrote seventeen songs about the experience and turned it into a musical.  In 2008, I 
presented the debut performance of the show as a staged reading, and it continues to grow 
with enthusiastic audiences and additional shows. With the help of many talented and generous people, we've put on four shows so far that have raised thousands of dollars in the fight against cancer. We have done staged readings and concerts.  If you've been touched by cancer in some way - a friend, a loved one, or perhaps you're a survivor yourself - I hope you'll consider supporting this show. ******************************************************************************************** Based on a true story of a man battling testicular cancer, ""Turning Thirty, The Musical"" is a journey of courage, love, hope, and family.  With styles of music ranging from gospel and country to jazz and swing, Turning Thirty The Musical takes you on an incredible ride.The story begins on the thirtieth birthday of the main character, Conlan.  He enjoys his work. He and his wife are thinking of starting a family.  However, an unexpected and unwelcome visitor arrives to change their lives forever.  Conlan learns that he has testicular cancer and must go through several operations to battle it.  His cancer is personified as T.C., a character who sees himself differently than one might expect.   ""Turning Thirty, The Musical"" explores the needed surgical procedures and medical tests, the support of family and friends, and even the humorous side of the struggle, through song…and through magic.  As Conlan learns that the sword is not able to stop T.C., he struggles to save his life while desperately trying to bring new life into the world.  Join Conlan, his wife, a doctor, a wizard, and a child in an unforgettable story. ******************************************************************************************** A behind the scenes rehearsal:

Lead Detective of the West Hills Police Department and often tasked with the Drug Enforcement Agency due to the increase in drug-related crime in a three year period. John is a stubborn and wild-eyed man running into situations without a clear thought in his head. Although hardened by 17 years of duty, met with several scars from bullet wounds, the hard fought man is a family man first and always; dedicated and loyal. The best they come. However, that all changed when a new drug hit the streets. ""Death Metal"" it had been code-named by the younger members of the DEA task force. The new drug on the streets spread like wild-fire over night. The body count wasn't the only thing that began to rise dramatically. The question on John Lawson's mind was, ""who was making and distributing these new drugs?"" and more importantly.... ....""why is there virtually no trace left of the new drug?"" Introducing Tom Parker: Giving Back To The Community!: A little over ten years ago, my one-year old second cousin Taylor Thomas was rushed to the Phoenix Children's Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona where she would be treated for life-threatening injury caused by accidental drowning. In the hospital for nearly a year, she was released following signs of improvement and able to function normally. Almost a year later, she was rushed back to the same hospital when her brain had swelled from an apparent infection. She continued to fight for yet another year like the little soldier she was. Unfortunately, only this time was she on the losing end and passed away. Every year since her passing my family and I had made it our mission to donate what we could during the Winter holidays. And that is why we feel by contributing to something as simple as the $5 perk you are helping send an additional $1 to a child in need at the Phoenix Children's Hospital. July 10th at the Comic & Media Expo Meet & Greet at Jesse James Comics in Peoria, Arizona - all proceeds from sales of the 11x17 prints of the comic book cover go directly towards the Phoenix Children's Hospital Hope Fund. Please help us in this noble cause! About the Hope Fund: ""The Hope Fund is the most flexible and valuable way donors can support Phoenix Children’s Hospital, allowing us to meet new challenges and take advantage of opportunities as they arise. The Hope Fund helps us launch critical new programs, purchase essential equipment, conduct cutting-edge research, provide charitable care, and much more. Many donors choose to support specific programs and services that meet their areas of interest and personal goals, and these gifts are valuable and essential to our mission.

Right now, I am working on turning it a into Comic Book Publishing company. I am also a comic book writer for T.R.I.B.E. Studio Comics, column writer for The WOD Newspaper & Webzine and a Judge for the 2nd Annual The Geekie Awards.

Other members included that of Kyle Higgins, Tom Hutchison, Raven Gregory, Eric Esquivel, Pat Shand and more. About Rob Dumo: I’ve been working as a professional artist since I was 17. Starting as a theme park caricature artist, I’ve had the opportunity to learn from some of the greatest caricature artists in the country. This has helped me develop into one of the top caricature artists in western New York. On top of my local work, I’ve traveled all over the country to both draw and train other artists. My first couple years of college were spent attaining a degree in graphic design. The next two years were spent getting my Bachelors in fine art, concentrating on drawing and painting. While working on my bachelors, I also completed courses from the Joe Kubert School for comic book illustration. It's always been important to me to be well rounded. I've spent over a decade drawing caricatures professionally as well as managing various other art operations. I frequently do graphic design work which I've been at for over a decade as well. My publishing credits include work for the online science fiction magazine Baen's Universe illustrating When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth by Cory Doctorow, The Ancient Ones part 1 and 2 by David Brin, and The Darkness by David Drake. I penciled issue #1 and 2 for Northern Lights Comics Thoughtless. I penciled and inked issues #1-3 of Broken Icon Comics Nightmare Unknown now out in TPB. I penciled Broken Icon Comics Chosen and Forsaken #0. And most recently penciled issue #3 of Robyn Hood for Zenescope.

With the assistant principal breathing down his neck, summer school around the corner, and his alcoholic dad not making things any better at home, it’s up to Mitch, and his best friend Danny to weasel out of their obligations. And with incredible luck (for Mitch) he gets misdiagnosed with terminal cancer thanks to Jango, a (sort of) wise and sickly homeless man who hangs out with Danny! Yay!  As you can imagine, it’s hard to tell a young boy with cancer that he’s going to get left back and spend the rest of his summer in a steaming hot public facility. It’s very hard to do that… Having said all that, it’s a story about education, and growing up. A story about finding love and losing love.

being made into a graphic novel to be published in 2012 by Sea Lion 
Books.  It's a huge thrill to get the book published by Sea Lion but 
that's only part of the story.  The story needs illustrated and lettered
 and I am working with 2 very talented and wonderful artists who are 
taking drastic cuts in their normal fee's because they believe in and 
are so committed to the story and its characters.  The story is 
about 4 
disparate high school seniors who come together to compete in their 
school's battle of the bands,  Winning the competition takes on more if a
 meaning to the band, dubbed ""The Stereotypical Freaks"" (because the 
members feel they are stereotyped by their classmates - smart kid, geek,
 star athlete and quiet weirdo when in fact they are much more then 
that) when one member reveals that he is dying from cancer.  The
 protagonist was inspired by and is based on the late John Challis (http://www.youtube.com/watch...)
 who was an amazing, unforgettable kid who had a profound effect on me. 
 The story centers on the battle of the bands but the main themes are 
that of friendship and loss. Funding recd will enable me to 
pay my team and finish the (stalled at this point) book and meet our 
deadlines with Sea Lion Books so that the book can come out in March, 
2012.  It would be a huge loss/blow to not be able to finish the book 
and thus have it published. Usually getting a publisher interested
 in a manuscript/story is the hard part, in my case its the reverse.  I 
had 3 interested publishers but now I simply need to give them the

brain cancer told through artwork. It is titled The Art of Fighting Cancer. 
After trying with my other book (Jetty’s Brain Book) and hitting all
dead ends, I now know I will have to self publish if I ever want these books to
see the light of day, as agents will not give me the time of day. I have found
a place to print my book and now I need the funding to push it through. The amount includes both the publishing costs and the upgrade to allow the Pro features. It will consist of several different styles of
art as I have (as my friend once described herself) art ADHD. I just can’t
focus on one piece. I plan on making a total of 70 full color pages worth of a
variety of art. Currently I have around 25 pieces and I plan on making many,
many more for this project. There are many cancer books out there but none
dealing with the world of art and cancer specifically.  It will be a fun book with unique ways of
looking at this journey. I have already begun major work on this project and I
know it will turn out beautifully but I can’t do it without you but I have not
forgotten to give it back to you either. I have several rewards for those who
back this project.  I currently run a
contract art studio and many of the rewards are custom pieces of art work of
your choice.  Here are some examples of the baby sized quilts. These make
a wonderful present and are painted with medium that makes them washable. The
backing is fleece and matches the themes picked.

 You may be wondering what in the world a chemo pet is. Well,
a Chemo Pet is my project fundraiser for my website, but now, one can be yours
for backing this project. A Chemo pet is a button eyed, bean bottomed, stuffed
friend with a pouch on the back to hold helpful items. The items that I
normally put in are items that are helpful for someone going through
Chemotherapy, but many of the pets I have created were for people who do not
have cancer. They can be made in standard chemo pet style or the recently
broadened animal styles. This would be a custom project that could be your
favorite animal or favorite color, fabric style, the list of customizable
options is very, very long. Here are some examples here: 




  




 




 














 You can see even more here: http://www.lagomorphstudios.com/chemopets.html Also everyone who donates over $5 will get an online drawing
of themselves listed next to their name on the thank you page. This will be
either a digital or pencil drawing which will be scanned and posted online from
a photo that you will need to provide to me. It does not necessarily need to be
of you but just what you would like next to your name.  The book is being accompanied by a full art community
website which is where donor’s names will be listed with their photo
drawings.  It is still under the
construction phase but when everything is complete it will be located at: www.endingcancerinourgeneration.org.

My name is Robert Lutz, and this is my kickstarter campaign. First off, I’d like to thank all of you who visit, and extra thanks to those who actually read the whole thing!  It may be a little long, but wanted as much detail as I could place on here. Not very good in front of the camera, but supermodels are budget busters! 
What it’s for
  My campaign is to raise funds to open a water-transfer film application shop.
What is water-transfer? It is taking a pre-patterned hydroglyphic film of the customers choice, and applying it to virtually any metal or plastic object. As this is accomplished using a water dip tank, it’s more ecologically sound than using older methods of glue and acid. And allows for a better, smoother finish. With the advancements in films and application methods, the process has come a long way from its infancy. 
Why water-transfer?
   I’ve always enjoyed giving customers what they want. And as I’ve always had pride in my work, this business will give me the ability to continue that tradition. With over 500 patterns readily available, plus custom design and custom paint, I’ll be able to turn anyone’s toys and small furnishings into their dream design. From switch plate covers to atv’s, it can be patterned to the individuals taste. Basically, I’m taking your blah items and giving them a bold exciting new look.   The idea is to continue to grow the business and myself, through the aggressive actions below, to put on new hires as it expands, thus being able to give back to my community also. This business is perfectly suited to address those demands as it fits with my skill set. The production process also allows for a rapid turn out time, which benefits both the customer and the bottom line. 
How it works
   Once the customer has decided to have an item patterned, it gets cleaned & degreased. From there, the hydroponic film is cut to size and is floated in the pre-heated water of the dip tank. Once the film has reached the proper temp, the item is then placed onto the film and submerged.  ( electronics don’t get dunked!) This causes the film to permanently bond to the item. After that, it gets rinsed and placed in an infrared oven to dry. When dry, it gets sprayed with a clear coat and back in the oven to cure.  For items that get a base color, or just small paint jobs, that gets sprayed first, then in the oven to cure.  Other than some personal tweaks and tricks, that’s pretty much what’s involved. Actually there is a lot of spray work involved. Glad I’m good at it! Hence I’ll need 2 spray booths. One for paint, and one for clear coat. And at least 3 spray guns with extra nozzles.  And a separate booth I’ll hand craft for the oven. All these machines- Tanks, dryers, ovens, air compressor) need juice, so I’ll be hiring an electrician to install the 4 dedicated 220volt lines I’ll need. Can’t wait to see the electric bill on that! & a tin man to run exhaust ducts so I’m not breathing vapors all day long. That for sure would get the creative juices flowing all the wrong way!  Once completed, the finish is very durable and long lasting. If you imagine the wood grain paneling inside of a vehicle, that is pretty much a water-transfer piece. This process is an excellent alternative to other hard and soft coverings at a reasonable cost. Here's a link to some u tube vids; click any one, they all show the basic process. https://search.yahoo.com/search?p=hydro+dip+u+tube&fr=ush-mailn_02&fr2=p%3Aml%2Cm%3Asb Why I’m stoked on this
   As a former business owner, (custom home improvements) for over twenty five years, I dropped that field when the economy tanked and profit became elusive. I went into retail(logical, as one always has to sell oneself before selling to others) to learn the ins and outs of receiving, selling, and merchandising. After 5 years of that, last year I contracted stage 3-throat cancer. Through determination and aggressive treatment, I am happy to say that my doc says it’s gone. Will still have to monitor it, and am definitely looking forward to reducing the frequency of tests I have endured. That said, the disease made me realize I belong back in a market where I can produce custom projects for the consumer. I’ve always had a passion for doing all the finish work in my career, along with dabbling with paint and body work.
What I love about this is that it provides that custom feel good product. Something for the consumer to show off. With moderate investment, and hard work, it is a business I also will be able to pass down to my daughters or grandsons.  The market. 
   As this will be a Florida based business, I will be initially marketing to the hunting, fishing, marine, and general outdoors interests in this area. Seeing as there is no business in this area that provides these services, I expect a healthy response. Eventually, through web page, and family contacts, I expect to take orders nation-wide.  Preliminary research has led me to believe that this is an up and coming market, with over 500 designs, plus custom painting, each order can be personalized to each individual taste. Which is a great thing, as in my area people like to trick out their toys! Everyone I have spoken to has expressed an interest in having designs placed on their motorcycles, boat parts, atv’s, gun stocks, even the mods of those who vape. Possibilities are numerous. . I still have some leg work as in meeting with marina owners, tackle shops, car dealers, and local bike shops. As each day passes, the more people I speak to, the more the expressed interest is in contracting out and/or referring my work.   Where I’m at. 
 At this point in time, with about 200 hours invested, & one very full notebook, I have set up the supplier, detailed the list of equipment needed, with prices, spoken to permitting agents, received approval from my supplier for use of their patterns in promotional material, have looked at shop space. I have aligned with a company to provide me with a comprehensive POS (point of sale) system allowing me to take and track orders, inventory and sales. I have all the necessary paperwork (permits, registration, lease, corporate submission, bank accounts, etc) waiting to be filled out and ready to submit at end of campaign.  To be able to do this commercially, you need the dip tanks, sprayers, dryers, film, cabinets, sinks and so on.($$) That’s just some of the hardware  Cabinets, storage, tarps; incidentals add up fast. Lined up a mechanic, at a fair hourly rate, to disassemble auto parts prior to dip and reassemble after product is finished.
  I’ve rough sketched out the floor space needed (1200sq ft-contractor, I know how to do that!) so that I can get it all in place when delivered.  Once all the equipment is in place, I’ll be able to take orders & provide finished products. You can’t bake the cake if you don’t have the oven! Basically, everything except for the financing is ready to go.  I’d like to add that my supplier will provide me with complete and thorough training on the use of the equipment. 
    Once financing is achieved, the following requirements are needed. The purchase of equipment, storefront, permitting, marketing and shipping. You know, the fun part! The plan (&where the moneys going) 
   At the end of campaign, or once my funding goal has been reached, things will be hectic for the first 6 weeks. Expecting major outlay of funds at this time. All permits and corporate and bank papers will be filed in the first 3 days. 
Lease will be signed & insurance acquired.  Equipment will be ordered and set up for delivery while permits pending,(budget time 5 weeks for  permits and inspections) . During the wait time on the permits, I’ll be training on the new equipment at suppliers location, setting up equipment, producing the web site, POS station and other tools to make opening and operating go smoothly. I’m budgeting an extra 10 days after zoning inspection for electrical & plumbing work. Will contact local paper for opening day interview. Small town, so the paper loves writing up new business.  Once up and running, for the first few months, I will need 1 employee,(reason to spend the extra $ on the POS system, ease of taking orders) outside of hiring a web designer. As orders expand, and business picks up, I will put new hires on as needed. I would prefer to hire other cancer survivors, I know how difficult it is to find work after treatment.  Equipment will be shipped to the new destination, with enough material to cover the first 3 months or so of operation, so that product can be turned out rapidly. Custom orders will be taken, with an allowance time for ordering new material. Normally it’s a 3 day delivery on film from supplier.   The storefront with combined shop area leasing is available in my area at a reasonable cost, It will also double as the production space needed . I have also considering renting space in an existing body shop, as that will eliminate most of the permits needed. We’ll see how that goes. 
  Marketing will be by signage, web, social media, local business store displays, word of mouth and placard displays at various craft shows and yes, even flea markets. I have seen firsthand how profitable a booth at an established market can be and do not want to discount how valuable they can be. A place where people can touch the items is extremely important, as I have noticed over the years that once someone picks an item up, they’re not likely to put it down and therefore make the purchase.   .
    Receiving orders will be multi faceted, from walk-ins to web. Telephone orders will be accepted as well, although customers will have to visit the web page first to pick their design. As for shipping, I already have a contact who handles UPS and Fedex, she will supply me with fairly accurate table of costs so I know how much to charge. Smaller items can go USPS. North America shipping only as international (overseas) would be cost prohibitive. My POS system will incorporate printing shipping labels, that’s a big plus. Turn around time for orders should be under two weeks from receipt of item to be printed.
 
  After speaking to the supplier, and web searches for comparable companies, I found there is no other company in the southwest Florida offering this type of product. And being midway between Sarasota and Fort Meyers, I have a large customer base to draw from. Therefore the time is now to get it up and running, to grab the market share while making a name producing excellent product at a reasonable cost. Prices will only rise in the future, and this is an investment that can be held in the family for years to come.  Again, everything is in place except for the financing.

ANDY: 
Mum, you shouldn't eat sweets. 
ELIZABETH: I'll have just one. How do you convince a terminally-ill person that there is still something worth living for? When Elizabeth is told that chemotherapy didn't work, she refuses to undergo any further treatments and let the disease run its course. Her husband is dead and her daughter Andy has grown up and has a man who can take care of her. What Elizabeth doesn't know though, is that there's still something she can do for her daughter, for the circle to be complete, something she has wished for her whole life which she has forgotten about. There's still something which is worth living for. The themes of this story are the motivation we have to live our lives and, in particular, what makes a life worth living. 
Cancer is a tragically widespread disease in today's society which comes around like a thunderbolt, sometimes out of nowhere, claiming thousands of victims every year just in the UK. People undergo treatment after treatment, surgery and more treatments and in 60% of the cases it works.  
But what about that 40%? What if your life is naturally coming to an end, you are happy with the life you lived and all you want is to keep your dignity even in death? Is it still worth undergoing further treatments? Is that 60% worth suffering the several side-effects caused by treatments and surgery? 
Another theme of this story is the power that our loved ones have in influencing our decisions and the impact our choices have on them. In particular, the story also conveys the point of view of Andy who, as an only child, has always felt the pressure of making her parents proud. When her mother tells her that she has nothing left to live for, the young woman blames it on herself for not being able to keep her mum happy and proud. In a desperate attempt to dissuade her mother from giving up, Andy takes her on a journey throughout time, reminding her of who they've been and what they've done together, since she was a small girl until now. Andy does even more than that, suggesting a new life for Elizabeth, a new start, a new hope. ELIZABETH Elizabeth is a 63-year-old woman living alone in London. The untimely death of her husband, when she was 55, caused her a lot of pain but her daughter Andy gave her a reason to go on living. The lovely relationship with her daughter, the pride in seeing her getting married and achieve her dreams helped her recover, but happiness lasted just for a few years. When she was 60, Elizabeth was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer located in her intestine. Supported by her daughter, she tenaciously fought it, repeatedly undergoing surgery to remove the tumorous mass and chemotherapy to destroy the remaining neoplastic cells. But today, after 3 years of treatments which deeply affected the quality of her life, the cancer is still there and despair and resignation have replaced the will to live in Elizabeth's heart. ANDY Andy is a 27-year-old woman, living in London with her husband. After spending years studying hard, she recently graduated in English Literature and she now works as a journalist. She is an only child and she has always been extremely close to her parents. When her father passed away, Andy grew even closer to her mother, as she knew she was now Elizabeth's only reason to live. As an only child, Andy has always felt the pressure to make her parents proud. She knows how much her mother has always wanted to become a grandmother and when she gets pregnant, her first thought is how happy Elizabeth will be. However, when Andy learns that her mother decided to reject treatments and face her destiny, she feels that as a daughter she failed in keeping her mother happy. JONATHAN - CONSULTANT Elizabeth's oncologist is a 50-year-old man, very skilled, experienced and respected in his field. Despite his young age, he is already a widower and, like Elizabeth, he has found in his son a reason to live. He is very careful to his patient's needs, not only from a medical but also from a personal point of view. He has looked into Elizabeth's case for 3 years and he has always admired the strong and positive attitude with which she has always approached the treatments. The news that the tumour is still there comes as a surprise to him as well and all he can do is try to convince Elizabeth that there is still hope, if not to defeat the tumour, at least to contain it and to give her more time to spend with her daughter. Crêpes is a drama with a particular focus on family relationships, in particular mother- daughter relationship. The film works within the genre both theme-wise and tone-wise, given its social realism, in depicting the impact that cancer has on families and the way people face it. Crêpes has potential to appeal to a wide age group and to both men and women, with a slight bias towards a female audience. Moreover, the combination of family drama and social realism within the story makes it appealing for a socially engaged audience as well. Crêpes is a slow paced film with a warm tone and texture. The film begins with a shot of Elizabeth preparing crêpes, emphasising the significance it has to the character and the story which later unfolds as we live with the character. Elizabeth's story deserves a treatment that shows the contrast between her life and what she is neglecting. With visually rich design and dynamic camera movements, the story comes to life. 
The relationship between Andy and Elizabeth is depicted through the image of crêpes and the way the action of cooking together is carried out mirrors the state of the mother-daughter relationship, at the different stages that the film shows. Cooking crêpes is an activity that mother and daughter have always enjoyed doing together, from when Andy was a little girl, throughout their whole life together. It's also a tradition that Elizabeth learned when she herself was a child and which she has now passed on to Andy. The action of cooking crêpes together mirrors their mother- daughter relationship raising the themes of the heritage that a mother passes on to her daughter, but also of loneliness in opposition to the company, suggesting that we have a more positive perception of life when we are surrounded by the people we love.",103.353118864,1137,50,1.0586666666666666,30.0,7,4,2017,0,1,22,general,1,0,1,0,0.0008795074758135445,0.0,0.41974330533988274,2.910150833660819,1.0,kickstarter

Because of the anticipation in presenting the first production of, "" Sweet O'l Mama, "" which will be my survival journey coming to you live on stage! In case your wondering, what's she talking about? You see, 8 years ago I had decided to LIVE, and not die through an unforgettable stage 3 breast cancer diagnosis, and unexpectedly becoming homeless with my 3 children who were 2, 6, & 10.  The photo above happens to be where the first performance of, "" Sweet O'l Mama, "" will debut for two shows on October 10, 2015. I've been in touch with the McAlister Auditorium's business manager and theater director, they take care of collecting funds, from theater companies in advance to reserve the beautiful space for ballets, musicals, stage plays, and concerts etc...  Are you familiar with what it takes to really direct/produce an awesome theatrical? It seriously is a must, that the producer is passionate about the entire production, and has transparent communication with his/her cast, because they make the show and are out there working hard to bring the director's vision to fruition.  Ok! So, while the cast & Co will be hard at work ( 10 wk rehearsals, a photo shoot, wkly commutes from NC, GA, Tenn, & setting hotel reservations to be in town for their dress rehearsal on 10/9/15) others may be anticipating Sweet O'l Mama, to be one of the most electrifying, dramatic, heart wrenching performances to open during this years breast cancer awareness month. And it will, because this Kick Starter campaign will enable us (cast/myself) to enter the McAlister Auditorium on Saturday October 10, 2015 with no worries, and a peace in knowing we're about to show up and show out for Greenville :)!! Can you feel the excitement?  We're expecting two sold out performances, as our tickets will be priced at a shocking affordable rate. Sheree's Studio's ultimate goal is to "" Pay It Forward "" to one non-profit organization of Greenville SC, thru a portion of ticket sales. The reasons for us Paying It Forward can only be found in the memoir, "" Till I Grow, "" which unravels my breast cancer journey, and other unbelievable life experiences.  I can not wait to sit in the audience, observing the cast breathing fresh life, into such a familiar subject rarely seen live on stage.

Sara is a young women hurling along on her daily roller coaster ride through the urban landscape of twenty-first century New York City. For Sara, the pace is quickened and complicated by the fact that she is genetically pre-disposed for cancer. With this impending threat, Sara fears that “art may begin to imitate life,” and she may ultimately be forced to stand-in on a life that may not entirely be the life of her choosing. Armed with her common sense, a good sense of humor and a gritty thick skin, Sara takes on these gauntlets between her present reality and her dreams of acting in front of the camera. Her quest is told through the view points of both the stand-in and the star- looking out from, and being filmed by the camera, through the ongoing sequences of the pilot. Stand-In is based on the co-creator and executive producer's life experience, as she was diagnosed as BRCA positive in 2011– the diagnosis that made international headlines with Angelina Jolie. The diagnosis had a significant resonance, as her mother was diagnosed with Stage IV inflammatory breast cancer at age 38, and miraculously survived- only to succumb to pancreatic cancer at the age of 56. She was losing her mother when she received her BRCA diagnosis, but as she wanted to protect her mother from altering her own life choices, she kept her diagnosis from her and continued to lend her support as her mother fought and ultimately succumbed to her battle. The creator's mother passed away on September 9, 2012, and she herself had her last two surgeries in relation to her own double mastectomy in October 2012 at the age of 26. 
 The goal of our project is to champion a more sensitive and realistic return to television programming. Through the events and circumstances personally experienced, our company felt compelled to create work that would help women who were confronting challenging life choices, beyond the already unique and complex decisions presented to women in the twenty first century. Our hope, in relation to this project, is to encourage women to define what is beautiful to them, and thereby, what is truly important- and not fall victim to society’s conception of the female identity. As artists, we believe using our experiences to make a connection with young women, through Sara’s decisions and discoveries, would be our most appropriate way of offering relevant support. We are currently casting and financing at the same time, and expect to shoot in New York from December 7-12th. We have put together a professional and talented crew, many of whom have worked on various Oscar nominated films and Emmy-award winning TV shows, as well as  having earned a few Emmy-awards of their own. They have now chosen to work on this project pro bono, based on their belief in the material, and the projected success of the project.  Please help us raise our funding goal, so that we may afford the necessary, remaining production expenses at this time to help complete pre and post-production.",194.23076923076923,563,19,1.01,30.0,11,2,2015,1,1,21,mixed,2,0,2,0,0.003552397868561279,0.0,0.5058605798889574,4.134478716621464,0.0,kickstarter

What I'm doing.

  I am documenting my journey to our State Capitol and to Washington DC as a childhood cancer advocate and DIPG awareness activist, making observations about how the campaign for a National DIPG Awareness Day is received, both by other childhood cancer advocates and Congressional representatives, and to investigate further the challenges to raising awareness for any pediatric cancer.  I will also be attempting to speak with at least one official at the NIH, and interviewing DIPG parents about their experience and those who have started foundations in memory of their departed child.  Three neuro-oncologists specializing in DIPG will be interviewed, Dr. Girish Dhall, Chair of the Neural Tumors Program at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Dr. Monje at Stanford School of Medicine, and yet to be confirmed, Dr. Souwedaine at the Weill/Cornell Medical Center. This is a personal study in which I am making myself the guinea pig, for my inspiration comes from the loss of my 3 year-old son Jack to DIPG.  I am renting some equipment but basically am recording all the information myself, by selfie video, writing, and talking with people. I will be representing Jack's Angels Foundation for DIPG Research and Support at CureFest in Washington DC on September 20th, which should be fine material in and of itself!--and as a colorful addition of the personal experience of a DIPG parent who has started a foundation with very little, and fighting hard to continue raising awareness.  This experience, for the audience, could be applied to many different sets of circumstances where raising awareness is critical to changing an injustice and/or indifference to suffering in any culture. This project is the first step towards making a documentary film about the DIPG experience.  My primary goal with the project is to write several pieces for publication in print and on the web, ultimately to further getting a National Day for DIPG, but I'm looking forward to the next step as well.  The money will be spent mostly on logistics--air-fare, rental cars, and the basics of travel necessities.  Any monies received above and beyond the stated amount will go towards the basics and further developing and producing this project.  I'm asking for a small amount that would, at the very least, help me get where I need to go.  My greatest hope is that whatever money is donated will return to the world ten fold in a helpful and informative project.",80.85714285714286,565,21,1.132,12.346608796296296,8,3,2015,1,1,23,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,1.4312968993119888,1.0,kickstarter

But we an always use a it more to make this incredible story fly! Please pledge today! The Problem: 

At the edge of the
Pacific, women believe they’re part of an unexplained breast cancer cluster.
It’s a fear created by media hype and medical researchers who should know
better. Since the '90s, the San Francisco Chronicle has published a steady stream of articles
claiming the affluent, mostly white women of Marin have the highest rate of
breast cancer in the country, as much as 35 percent higher than the national
average. Year after year, breast
cancer researchers spend millions of dollars studying why women in the wealthiest communities are targeted by the dread disease. This
research agenda is dominated by businesses with skin in the cancer game, including AstraZeneca, Avon, Chevron, Baker
Hughes. Meanwhile, women suffer from needless anxiety, terrified that cancer is stalking them. What if women in Marin are
in fact much less likely to get or die of breast cancer than are women in less affluent communities? What if tens of
millions of health dollars are being wasted chasing after statistical
flukes? Medical experts without corporate ties say there
is not a breast cancer epidemic in Marin. Listen to Patricia T.
Kelly, Ph.D., the author of “Assess Your True Risk Of Breast Cancer”: 

The short story is that affluent women get more
mammograms than women with less access to health care. The excessive use of mammography increases the number of small cancers detected. But it also increases the number of false positives, and results in the treating of non-cancerous tissue. Simply put: overdiagnosis leads to overtreatment—subjecting
women to surgery, radiation, and chemical toxins that cause painful side effects and cost lots of money. Yes, some lives are saved by early detection, but the widely believed 
statistic that ""one out of eight women will get breast cancer"" is a 
misnomer. More accurately, nine out of 1,000 American women over the age
 of 60 die from breast cancer each decade. And black women have by far 
the highest mortality rates. The Solution Supported by the Fund for Investigative Journalism, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Point Reyes Light is following
the money. ""Busted"" explains how breast cancer statistics are manipulated by governmental
and non-profit organizations that can benefit by marketing fear instead
of solutions.  Investigative journalist
Peter Byrne has interviewed dozens of experts and examined hundreds of medical
studies and public records. The documented results of this investigation call on America to reform the science of breast cancer research. Scientists can focus on prevention by modeling risks for individuals and populations realistically. Unfortunately, our cancer databases are so riddled with errors that breast cancer incidence studies are unreliable. A major study
 of the California Cancer Registry warned that, ""Reporting the quality 
of care derived from [cancer registry] data with such validity problems 
could anger providers and seriously undermine public confidence in this 
process."" Please PLEDGE what you can so that the vital information presented by ""Busted"" will be heard by the people who need it the most. Good News Our multi-part investigation promises some relief to worried women in Marin and
other misidentified breast cancer clusters in Seattle, Long Island, Orange
County and Ohio. We will provide updates in
the reporting as we interview the researchers and public
health officials who struggle with the myth of suburban breast cancer
clusters.  And in the face of hard questioning, key scientists are already
hedging claims of a breast cancer epidemic in Marin. Here is Dr. Christina A. Clarke of the Cancer Prevention Institute of California: This is a local story of tremendous national significance. Make a difference to women everywhere—no matter where you live! Your PLEDGE will enable the Point Reyes Light to complete and publish this investigation in June 2015. First, it will be printed in the newspaper. Then, we will publish the ""Busted"" ebook that links readers to the medical studies, video interviews, and public records that back up the facts.  The rewards for PLEDGING include copies of the ""Busted"" series in newsprint, the ""Busted"" ebook, and a two year subscription to the Point Reyes Light.

We are passionate about using high fashion as a medium to fight cancer.  I, Zofia, am a photochemist and a cancer researcher.  Jeremy is a cancer survivor who has spent his career in the fashion industry.  We recognize that our world is changing.  People want to shop smart and support products that are different and that make a difference. Tomorrow beauty, quality, and craftsmanship of luxury products may not be enough. This is why we dream of a new culture of luxury, where history and quality meet innovation and impact.   Beautiful products with a beautiful purpose. We transpose colors and patterns of dyes used in diagnosis onto beautiful fabrics as a means to raise awareness.  Read our story below. To date we have created product prototypes, designed a Breast Cancer Awareness inspired line and formed relationships with both manufacturers and organizations focused on cancer education.  However to help fund production of a small accessory line we still need to raise $20,000.  We are  now thrilled to be at our stretch goal of $25,000!!   We graciously ask for your support in any amount.  100% of funds raised through Kickstarter will go towards development and manufacturing of ÉSTAINE products.  In return for your kind pledge we offer exclusive ÉSTAINE accessories, gifts and our sincerest gratitude.

With love, Zofia & Jeremy RAISE AWARENESS & TELL OTHERS YOU SUPPORTED OUR KICKSTARTER! TWEET: #estaine #makebeautifulimpact @estainefashion The inspiration for ÉSTAINE began many years ago when Zofia performed cancer research as a part of her Ph.D. studies in photochemistry. Zofia not only studied the effects of cancer from a molecular level, but also how emotional well-being impacts prognosis.

 In her later work for Roche, developing dye solutions used in cancer diagnosis, Zofia imagined the beautiful colors and patterns of the stained cells gracing flowing dresses and fabrics--telling the story of a survivor.

 Moved, she created Couture for Cancer, an educational fashion fundraiser depicting the science behind the fight with cancer and supporting a local children’s oncology center. Ironically, in the midst of planning the show, Zofia’s husband, Jeremy, a fashion entrepreneur, was diagnosed with stage 3 lymphoma.

 Over the following years, Zofia and Jeremy grew more passionate about fashion as a medium for cancer education and patient support. Out of this passion, ÉSTAINE was born.

 While ÉSTAINE is about extraordinary fashion, it is so much more — it is about educating the community and aiding those fighting the battle against cancer. The one-of-a-kind designs tell not only of science, but also the stories of survivors, inviting questions that lead to awareness. WE BELIEVE IN: Beauty & Creativity – splendor and exclusivity of not only products, but ideas. We want to do things differently, yet always exquisitely. ÉSTAINE products are as unique as they are stunning.     Craftsmanship – fashion is art. We build upon the artistry and history of lux fashion by manufacturing our accessories in Como, Italy. Hand finish is the ÉSTAINE finish.  Authenticity – our mission and business model reflects how we live. Zofia a cancer researcher & dye chemist and Jeremy a cancer survivor & fashion insider.

I involuntarily learned about brain tumors by having one and feel that people can benefit from learning about what it's like on the ""inside."" I know from experience that preaching to them will do no good (after all, they're probably just kicking back and watching the tube). I loved the feature film ""50/50,"" but out of necessity it had a conventional love story arc. ""No Brainer"" is a documentary, it really happened. Real doctors, nurses, medical technicians and medical experts will be mixed in with re-enactments of my experience, going from an ""able bodied"" film-maker to a disabled person. Since it was a brain tumor, wild hallucinations, entertaining to an audience, are an integral part of what we're doing. It's been long enough to look back with humor at some of the developments, but care will be taken to not negate the gravity of these issues. Sometimes all you can do is laugh. I have assembled the team and am constantly revising the script. Shooting begins as soon as we raise more money (we've already got some small grants from local sources). Contributions will help pay for the actors and crew necessary to make NO BRAINER a video worth watching. We're using an effects guy, Dan Kirchstein, that really knows the possibilities of state-of-the-art video, but these don't come free. The actors are all professionals from the American Players Theatre. The main actor, James Ridge, has appeared there and at many other Midwest theatres. The crew has over 50 years collective experience in public television. Our illustrator is Jay Rath, who has worked at Disney Animation and the Onion. The video images are based on those at the beginning of Fellini's 8-1/2, not to be snobby about references, but because they resemble most closely the vision I had after the surgeons scraped the tumor out of my brain.  I foresee DVD copies of this video available at hospital gift shops. When I was a patient I would have welcomed something that gave me a laugh and informed me of what might be in my future. People that work in the medical field might consider a contribution for a documentary that shows their side of the story. ",261.1304347826087,400,21,1.0051882845188285,40.041666666666664,11,3,2012,1,1,21,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

Thanks to everyone that helped us get over the top! Hopefully everyone will still want to pick up more of these limited edition comics. All of the comics here, when they are printed post Kickstarter, will not be the same. These will be special because THAT is what I promised you.  50% of anything above our goal will go to printing and promotion. The other 50% will be put to good use promoting young cancer awareness. Please continue to share and back it if you can. ""The Mighty Titan: A Backer's Cut"" will be very limited and will only be for Kickstarter backers who chose a reward with it! Thanks again for all of this. You have made a happy man, happier.  Full Disclosure - I am happy that no one picked the Original Jerry Ordway cover but it is still up for grabs for some lucky person!                                                             *** The Mighty Titan is my newest creation that essentially takes my cancer (and other) experiences and wraps them in a superhero shell. This isn't autobiographical. I have researched and talked to other cancer survivors to try and get the feeling of what other people have experienced. The plan is to do a 5 issue mini-series with the possibility of it continuing. I created Titan in 2004 during my first bout with Kidney cancer. It was a tough decision to take some of my personal experiences and put them to paper in order to entertain and possibly allow people a glimpse of what some of us go through while battling this potentialy deadly disease. Make no mistake, this is still a cool, fun superhero book with vile villians, giant Mechas and some really great mythological creatures. But there is certainly an underlying theme of fear and loss.  Imagine for a moment that you were the worlds strongest protector. Imagine that no knife, bullet or bomb can harm you. Then imagine in that moment you are told you have cancer. Titan is a character who is for all intents and purposes, invulnerable. He cannot be harmed by any means known to man. His alter ego doesn't have such luck. Titan's alter ego is dying. What now?  Isn't this the perception that we all have when not touched by cancer? We are all under the belief that we are invunerable.  Aren't we all someone's protector? Aren't we all everything to someone?  Not until that lump, or pain, or (un)lucky scan.  How we deal with this defines us. How we live with this strengthens us. What we lose is innocence and the loss of a clear mind. This is my epitaph. This is my way of dealing. This is my way of helping others understand what it feels like to be invunerable...   And then, one conversation, one sentence later... never feeling that way again.  ""I am sorry, Mr. Martino. You have renal cell carcinoma."" were the last words my 33 year old innocent, clear-minded self ever heard. From that day forward, I had cancer. Life was over. Even though, through the support and resolve of my friends, family and doctors. I survived. Twice.  WRITER/CREATOR: Joe Martino - Joe has been creating comics since he was 10 years old.

My name is Katie Jecha. I am an artist that is currently a student at the Perpich Center for Arts Education in Minneapolis, MN. While I work in many mediums, the illustrations in this book are done in a cut paper technique. I have been in Girl Scouts for 12 years and this project is part of my Gold Award (the Girl Scout equivalent of the Boy Scout's Eagle Scout achievement).  Thank you to my dad Steve Jecha, who inspired this project, is helping with this website and with managing the financing  and assisting with  with editing and book promotion.   With the funds that I raise, I will be publishing my initial 100 books for teens who have parents with cancer. The Money  The money I raise will help me pay for materials and the cost to publish/print my book, Reflections. I currently have half of the artwork images created for the book and am  working on the final images for the book. My goal is to complete all artwork by December 1, 2013 and to have books published by December 15th for distribution. The launch will feature artwork and stories from the book. $$$ will go to:  - Printing/publishing of 100 books for the launch  - Printing of promotional bookmarks and posters - Art Materials to complete the project - Pre-press preparation ( high resolution scans, layouts, etc.)  - Misc supplies The Story       Over the past year I had been exploring ideas for a project for my Girl Scout Gold Award.  I knew that I wanted to include my art and have it relate to young people in some fashion, and yet I had yet to find a true community need that spoke to me.  In February of 2013, I came home from school one day to the news that my dad had been diagnosed with colon cancer.  Surgery and chemotherapy followed.  During this process, I became familiar with Angel Foundation.  Among other things, this organization provides support groups and camp to kids and teens who have a parent with cancer.          There are many resources for younger kids, or even kids who have cancer themselves, but very little for teens.  I decided that asking the teens involved with AF to share their thoughts, ideas, poems or stories on how mom or dad's cancer had affected their own lives would meet this need.  The cut paper art technique that I developed and chose for this project seemed to be ideal to express the emotion conveyed by the words.   I am hoping that my book will  help highlight the challenges that  teens are face when cancer strikes a parent.        My book, Reflections, meets several needs.  A need for a book that teens can really identify with in a trying time, a project that meets a significant community need fulfilling my Girl Scouts' Gold Award requirement and finally a way for me to address the way colon cancer has affected our family.  Through my father's strength and positive attitude, watching him through his months of chemo without complaint, I was given the drive to see this project through. I am very proud of my work and confident that it will resonate with others. I am also very happy to say that my dad has completed chemo and should be cancer free. I am hoping that this cause will resonate with each of you as well as you imagine the challenge of being a teenager with a very sick parent and an uncertain future.

FOLLOWING WOMENS JOURNEYS THROUGH 
April 1, 2017
OVERVIEW This project was started to follow my friends through their breast cancer journeys. All the women I am documenting are from the same location that I grew up in. I would like to shed light on the similarities of their cases and do some location research to see if there one or more factors related, and come to any conclusions of all the similarities to my friends’ cases.
1.	Project Scope
To interview six of my childhood friends involved in the cancer fight who are in parts of Pinellas County, Pasco County, and Hillsborough County Florida. To speak Moffitt Cancer Institute’s researchers and educate myself in medical knowledge that I may not have found or come up with on my own. To research the area, we grew up in and take soil samples and water samples from the current timeframe to compare it to time frames from the past. To look for environmental factors playing a role in the diagnosis of these woman and breast cancer specifically, triple negative and if the BRACA-1 genome mutation is a factor.
2.	High-Level Requirements
My high-level requirements will be sponsorship and project backing for our documentary. I will need water and soil sampling companies, as well as independent labs to test said samples. Things such as gas cards, airline points or miles will greatly help, as I am in Colorado and the documentary is focusing on a small part of Central Florida. I want people to know I am out there and I am fighting my way right along with other warriors. This is a completely independent venture I have taken on. Any support would be wonderful. My goal is to create this documentary to help find possible similarities in the cases of women we have on board while they are still on this earth fighting this illness. I have the family of Patti Dick joining me on this project. She is my childhood friend that lost her fight. She, as well as all our daughters, sisters, mothers and wives that may be effected by this horrendous illness deserve to know if in fact, this is somewhat attached to the environment. All men and women with any type of Breast Cancer could be impacted. I need all the help I can get. Gas cards, airline miles, anything I can collect to raffle off and show that Colorado’s on our side with this fight. I will be going to Florida often to research and get interviews as we are following these ladies through their fight! I have now adopted this wonderful state as my home and we proud to have Colorado help in this venture. I now have a Moffitt Cancer Research doctor conducting interviews and an immense amount of research has been done to link these issues together. 
In closing, thank you for giving a few moments of your time for my journey. Stephanie Balfrey

My world was flipped upside down. I sat there as the doctor talked...All that I could pick up on were words like chemo, surgery, and radiation. I soon learned that chemo would cause me to lose my hair. I cried a lot as just a few weeks into chemo my hair started to fall out. I decided to throw a party, hire a henna artist, and shave it off. That's just what happened, and you know what? I ended the night with a smile on my face. That's how I hope this journey, as a cancer fighter, will end...with a smile on my face. Everyday I wake up and I put on my boxing gloves and I try my hardest to punch fear in the face. Together, I think we can do just that. (To read more about my story click here!) Once I realized that I was going to lose my hair and I started chemo, I started to search for hats and wigs. I realized that a lot of the websites for cancer fighters made me feel old or out of place. Along with needing to pay the bills (hey don't judge...cancer is expensive), the idea of opening up my own shop was born. Soon after that my idea of a store that sold wigs grew bigger then just wigs. I had the idea of selling bags of hope and inspirational products too! I don't want to be just another store either. I want to be a store that inspires. That reminds other cancer fighters or those going through a hard time that they are not alone in this journey.  Feel like you're alone? You're Not. Need a gift for someone newly diagnosed? I have your back. Need a gift for a caregiver? We have that too. Want a reminder that you got this? We have products to remind you. <3  As far as the name, Hope is the one thing that has gotten me through this. I don't think I'm doing this alone, God's got my back and has given me hope that there is a future ahead of me. Romans 15:13 says, ""May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit"". How powerful is that? The 25 stands for the age I was when I was diagnosed.  The funds raised will help me start up the store. It will cost money to produce the products I want (like getting t-shirts screen printed and getting the right inventory for the bags). I can't wait to get started and thank you in advance for your support! XOXO Melissa P.S.

It is inarticulate, cannot be uttered.  My pen has been my sword for cutting through the terror, how I have stood my ground in the face of death.  It's how I've spoken what I know to be most true, over and above the awful facts of my circumstance. Truth and beauty are how we fight against the darkness. Here are my ""cancer poems"". I want to share them in hopes that the things I've been through this year might give some help, some words to someone who could use them.  I'm honored (and rather amazed) to have paintings by  artist and dear friend Jodi Hays in this chapbook. The book itself will be a work of art, a creation designed and printed by David King at Extended Play Press. If we raise $1500, we can print 100 copies of the book. If we raise more- we can print more! The cost will pay for the book creation, thank Jodi a bit, pay me some. And then there's shipping. I have this hope that as part of the initial batch and hopefully some more, we can afford to print extras in order to share it with the people who've helped me through. I'd love for my oncologist, my radiologist, my pharmacist, my chemo nurses, my dear friends, to have a copy so that they can see and hear what was going on inside my head during my treatment.   After that- if we go past our Kickstarter goal? It will continue to pay to produce books and pay those of us who have created it. 1 in 8 women in the United States are diagnosed with breast cancer. I would love for this to provide words during hurt for some of them and those around them.  I'd love to get some copies into some bookstores. We've also thrown in some other possible goodies. Notably, Jodi is donating three (UPDATE: make that SIX!) original ink drawings. And if someone wants to hear from us in person, Kenny and I will fly to where you are and share some of these poems and the other art we make. We can't promise an ""all cancer all night"" evening (phew), but I'd be happy to read some of these as well as share some of our songs and hymns. More of the story below:  ********************************************** One year ago, I left Martha's Vineyard.  I had been awarded a grant by the Sustainable Arts Foundation to study poetry at the Martha's Vineyard Institute for Creative Writing- and my friend Flo had, too.  We made a road trip of it. Sustainable Arts Foundation grants are given to artists with young children.  While I was on the ferry back to the mainland, I reflected on what a grace it was to have a whole week to hone my writing, make a plan for creative projects this year, and be refreshed.  We stayed in the guest cottage of dear people, walked a lot, wrote a lot, ate cheese and fruit and prosciutto and chocolate and drank wine, and learned from fantastic writers.    We spent the day after the Institute on a literary tour with our dear Boston friend Kelly, touring Louisa May Alcott's Orchard House and walking around Walden Pond.  When I showered that night, I noticed that my breast was warm and red and puckered.  I had noticed this two weeks earlier, but had taken it for summer heat irritation, and then it seemed to go away.  I googled my symptoms, and the two possibilities that came up were mastitis and inflammatory breast cancer.  As I was no longer nursing, mastitis wasn't an option.  I drove to Pennsylvania the next day to get the kids from my parent's house on the way home to Nashville.  I tried to stay calm, but decided to go in to the local medical center for a mammogram. Then another. Then an ultrasound.   While I was waiting for the results of my ultrasound, I had a bad feeling.  I flipped through a collection of old poetry from my twenties and ran across a metaphor I'd never used, that I'd put into the mouth of God: ""I will come like chemo to kill so you can live.""  Little did I know... A nurse came in and told me it looked like inflammatory breast cancer.  We soon found out it was- a very aggressive cancer.  This past year has included biopsies, chemo, ER visits, a double mastectomy, 30 rounds of radiation that completely took my skin off, having my ovaries removed, CT scans, MRIs, blood work, fear, pain, comfort and victories.  At the one year mark, things are looking good.  No one really ever gives you an ""all clear""- but it looks good.  I've faced the past year with a lot of help from doctors, nurses, physical therapists, techs, friends, family and church. And I've become more and more convinced that having a week at Martha's Vineyard to hone my skills was a very intentional grace to prepare me for this year.  Through 102 doctors appointments (and counting...) and a year of hard things, I have written.  In waiting rooms, in my bed when I couldn't sleep or was working nausea or sweats, through having my breasts removed... I wrote. It's how I got fears out of my head.  It's how I shared what was happening inside of me with people who love me.  It's how I mined out the goodness that was inevitably somewhere, in every single day.  That's the story I want to share.",41.467289719626166,955,56,8.874,30.0,7,1,2018,1,1,19,breast cancer,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

My name is Michael J. Bachurski and this is my High School senior graduation project (SGP). I'm making a film about three young men who entangle themselves in the drug trade to pay for college. Their success and greed progresses until they eventually get caught up in the dangerous realm of corporate espionage. This gripping movie is chock-full of violence, robbery, drug dealing, and a plethora of other dissolute behaviors. The main character, Benjamin Michaels, does whatever it takes for him and his new family's dreams to come to fruition. The movie examines the very essence of morality in the real-life modern world pitting one value against another. Benny does what he has to do to survive in a culture driven by monetary interests.
 This project isn't just for me. The production affects others students' SGPs as well. Our production team consists of seven students, all with futures in photography, cinematography, practical and visual effects, and make-up. My assistant director, Evan Wickersham, ""Wyckly"", is doing wardrobe for the production. Wyckly owns a small business and he has offered to make clothes for the entire production. Ryan Huffman, a member of the cast, is an aspiring rap artist. He is doing the soundtrack for free. Redmond Watson is our visual effects manager, this gives him a big chance to build his portfolio. A lot of good can come from this. What is our 'Why'? The SGP form I choose is a service project, meaning that it needs to do some good for the community around it. The goal of this project is to generate funds to make impactful donations to the Four Diamonds Fund to help fight against pediatric cancer. The movie will premiere starting in April at the following locations: Theater Horizon, the Bryn Mawr film Institute, and Blob Fest. We will donate the money obtained through premier ticket sales as well as any balance of funds from the production budget. Every year my high school has its annual Mini Thon which is a dance event dedicated to raising money for pediatric cancer. Each year we sponsor a family and child and dedicate an entire evening to supporting them in their fight against cancer. As Mini Thon Head of Technology, I am responsible for filming the event every year in order to make a promo for the next year. Well this year I decided, why not just make a film? Our goal is for our donations to the Four Diamonds Fund to not only help our school break the $20,000 mark, but also, give a troubled family (or several) some peace of mind. How will the funds be used? We have been able to make a good start on this production utilizing my own video and sound equipment, equipment borrowed from others and the support of our school through the use of their facilities and equipment. However, it is not enough. $850 can take us pretty far! Below is the list of equipment and props we will purchase when we meet our goal. $850 would really help our dream come to fruition. However, (in the words of JFK) 'we can do better'. With any production, screen appeal generally increases with added production value. In general, achieving better production value is simple but expensive. What we need is better lighting, picture, audio, special effects, etc. And if we want this production to be able to compete against others in film competitions and be taken seriously as a film, we need to have our best 'production value foot' forward. Therefore, the following list details specific items we will purchase if we surpass our goal. These item have been put in order of necessity. In total we would like to raise about $10,000 to make this production the best production it can be. Although this a lot of money, purchasing this equipment would save time during shoots. As of now, using one camera and one microphone takes a lot of valuable time. Every shoot takes twice the amount of time it needs to. This problem can be fixed if we raise enough money to get another camera. It is as simple as that. The ability to shoot quickly would allow us to have more time for post-production, due diligence, and promotion. Also, two cameras would make it a lot easier to put scenes together in post (editing), as it reduces the possibility for continuity errors.",62.69375,747,48,1.1801176470588235,29.958333333333332,2,4,2015,1,1,8,general,2,0,1,0,0.002677376171352075,0.0,0.38933459178857954,2.0,0.0,kickstarter

He never before questioned orders, just did the job. But he has now come into possession of the cure for cancer, and learns that his powerful bosses want it destroyed, because for them - cancer is too profitable.  When his comrade and friend Sam Markham is brutally murdered, he realizes the stakes are high, too high, and his bosses will stop at nothing. Alex has a crisis of conscience, and decides not to follow orders; in fact he feels he has no choice but to expose the destructive truth for all the world to hear. He wants to protect his late comrade's sister - an unsuspecting Vanessa Markham (Christina Vernucci), to make sure she does not suffer the same fate as her brother.  He knows he needs to get the cure into the right hands, without knowing for sure who he can trust or who shares what opinion on unearthing the world's biggest secret. He needs to do this while being hunted by the world's most notorious mercenary, Officer Brix Richards (Simon Phillips), whose job is to maintain world order, and protect the agenda of the government, and the world's most powerful corporate interests.  We shot a scene to use as a Proof of Concept. There are clips from it in our Project Video, above. Here is the entire scene - you'll get a sense of the look and feel for our film, and meet the three primary characters. OK - it's no secret that we love the genre known as ""film noir"". So do plenty of movie goers - even some who may not realize it. Pulp Fiction, Se7en, Brick and Blue Ruin are the more obvious examples - but even some of the Batman films have had a very strong visual feel and a narrative reminiscent of film noir.  Whilst we're a fan of the classic noir genre, we also embrace the new, the different, and digital technologies which will help support our vision. We are confident that we have blended visual styles with topical themes and will create a most satisfying experience for the audience. We're not just wanting to make a vanity film for ourselves - we are striving to create something that will be broadly enjoyed in the manner of any high-quality, action-packed entertainment venture.  We're in full pre-production. Our cast is aboard. Our key crew is assembled. The film will be shot in Canada. The film's story is based in the U.S. We've enlisted a wonderful blend of seasoned and emerging artists. And - we've obtained a matching fund investment so that every dollar raised through this Kickstarter counts as two.   Many of us have also called in a few markers to keep the budget low and the production value high, to protect our independence and vision, and to make the film in black and white as a true film noir.  We have come to Kickstarter because we believe films are a collaborative effort, and what better place is there for us than Kickstarter, where the power of collaboration, especially in support of visionary indie film, has been shown time and time again.   CHRISTINA VERNUCCI - Writer/Producer and Actor Graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Cultural Studies, Christina Vernucci explored the visual, performing and media arts.

Design to be voted upon by backers based on any of the designs. Our Story My name is Peter Deltondo, a graphic designer from Southern California. A few months ago, my mom (Maria) was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. After the shock of the news set in, my wife and I sat down and brainstormed how we could help out. We decided to use our time & talents and we would sell artwork on my website to help raise cancer awareness & support my parents. After speaking with my close circle of designer friends about my plan and the news of my mom, there was an outpour of support. They all wanted to be involved and contribute artwork. It became clear very quickly, this was something bigger then just my mom. This was something that we could do together, as a design community, and make a real impact in the lives of men, women, & children fighting cancer. We set out to create products that not only do good, but become your new favorite shirt or print.  My wife and I love soft shirts, so that is what we set out to find.  We hope you will enjoy these comfy awesome T's as much as we do.  Our team is excited about all of the designs we are starting with, and we cannot wait to showcase new items in the future. About Design vs Cancer What we (Design vs Cancer) do is help raise awareness & support for people fighting all types of cancer. When we launch our store, the sale of our goods goes to helping families financially through their fight with cancer and helping the global effort for cancer research. To do this, we've reached out to amazingly talented designers from all around the world to create great works of art. Some have a focus on cancer, others are just plain cool! As I reached out to designers who have inspired me, I was amazed by the outpouring of support, and their willingness to jump right in! We have some amazing artwork here for our Kickstarter campaign, and we have more artists currently working on artwork for future products. You can learn more about us at www.designvscancer.org. While the primary color of our logo is pink in honor of my mom, we have a mark for every type of cancer, corresponding to it's ribbon colors. Our mark will change from time to time on our site (once launched) while we focus on a certain type of cancer.  The Designs Funding All funding from this campaign will be used to put this project into production and get everything printed and into your hands. Any extra will go towards inventory for the site so we can continue to produce these great products. How the funding breaks down:Kickstarter takes a 5% FeeAmazon Payments takes a 3-5% FeeRest of the funding will be used for production of goods to get these items to you and to have stock for our website. Over and Above Goals If the project goes over and above our goal by certain amounts, we'll look into making the shirts even better. Things like sewn on labels on the sleeves or bottom of the shirt, upgraded shirts, etc. We'll also work on adding some additional artwork for you to choose from once our $10,000 funding goal has been reached! Our Team I’ve teamed up with Mike Jones (Founder, Creative South Design Conference *which was funded earlier this year on Kickstarter) to launch Design vs Cancer. Mike & I met at Creative South and formed a close friendship. I'm honored & humbled to have such an amazing friend, mentor, and quality individual by my side through this. My good friend, developer Rob Davarnia has been at the forefront of helping us create our website & online store. When Rob heard about our project, he wanted to be a part of it right away. Rob's heart for helping others is worn on his sleeve. We've sat down for countless hours of design & coding to help make this idea go from a dream to a reality. About the Shirts The shirts will be printed on a very light weight t-shirt from NextLevel & Tultex tees. The model of NextLevel & Tultex cotton/poly tees may vary based on the design/fabric color. We will also remove all the tags from the shirts, because who likes an itchy neck? Instead we'll have a sweet custom printed tag right on the fabric. Printing Methods - Shirts: The shirts will be done with a water based discharge ink. Some designs may require a slightly different print process, such as a thin (we won't print anything heavy) plastisol screen print, or 4 color process print. However, we strive for the quality and comfort of the water based discharge ink as a number one priority. We want these shirts to be the coolest, most comfortable shirts you own! - Prints:
All 18""x24"" will be screenprinted if possible. If the design doesn't set up well for it, we'll run a giclee print. 10""x10"" prints will be either letterpressed or screen printed. The Rewards Obviously, the main point of the rewards is to get the shirts & posters in your hands! So while there are various reward levels, they are all basically just quantities of the items (discounted as they go). You can get one of each, you can mix and match, just pick the reward level that corresponds with the total number of shirts you want. - Apparel images here are mockups. Actual products may vary from the mockups in color tone, graphic size/positioning, etc. Number of inks used in the graphic, available colors, and brand of the apparel are all things that may change by the time the shirts go into production. - Shipping estimate is just that - an estimate. If I receive more orders than anticipated by an extreme margin, it may delay shipment of the rewards.

Likewise online crowd-funding to make those films in the first place is also something new that is changing independent film-making entirely. We've also updated the working title from 'Hope is Our Sanity' to the simpler title of 'Ellie'. This particular kickstarter is for the Irish indie feature film 'Ellie' which was just a logline in a word document several months ago but since then the script has been developed, drafted and re-drafted and re-drafted again. We also held auditions in December in which we cast the five main roles to five brilliant actors and we've also been putting together a talented crew to help bring this film to life! So what's different about this film and this filmmaking group? Of course I'll be funding this film project as much as I possibly can myself but there's only so much that we can afford so far in terms of equipment, set design and the likes. There are many other costly expenses to factor in such as insurance and editing costs. With a successful kickstarter campaign we will be able to complete this film far more effectively and produce a better product for viewers to enjoy afterwards. Here's how funds would be distributed;  Most of the funding would go towards equipment. We'd focus such funds on improving sound equipment, lighting & upgrading our tripod as well as maximizing filming efficiency by purchasing more SD cards to assure more memory.  It's important to note that when you make a 'pledge' no money goes through until (and if) the kickstarter succeeds, hence the term pledge. Finally when the film is available for online distribution in Spring of next year, we will be selling it for quite a low price (of about €2 - €3) and we will also probably offer a rental choice that will be even less in cost to offer some variation & choice for each viewer. *Disclaimer; Pie-chart distribution may be subject to variations if certain expenses become higher than expected. Also in regards to the promotion of media projects in exchange for funding listed under the 'pledge €10' section, any projects which incite discrimination or promotes violence will not be considered. Finally for sending rewards such as the clapperboard reward included in the €500 pledge, posting costs will be paid by us although travel expenses cannot be covered to come to the private screening or come on set as listed in some of the pledges. ",33.69491729999999,437,16,0.075,32.35472222222222,5,3,2015,0,1,25,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

It has a large community of supporters and a hopeful survivor rate. 2011: Dad got pancreatic cancer. 1.5% of people will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. It has a very small survivor rate, around 6%.  Here are a few of the features you can expect with wearecancer.com: Everyone who creates a profile will have a badge/ribbon next to their name and picture. The ribbon depicts the type of cancer, the circle represents the current fight, and the number is the stage of cancer. So, this person is currently fighting Stage 1 Breast Cancer. If the ribbon has a star instead of a circle, that tells us that this person survived that type and stage of cancer. So, this person is a survivor of Stage 1 Breast Cancer.    Like any other social media site, you will be able to post share and photos. When you create a profile, you will automatically be added to a community of people who have your specific type of cancer. Within that community, you will be able to find people who have your type of cancer, down to the stage. Example: People with stage 2 lung cancer will all be a part of the lung cancer community, but within that community, they will have a unique group that is exclusive to people with stage 2 lung cancer.   Blogging is a big part of the cancer community and we certainly don't want to take that away. You will be able to embed an existing blog into your wearecancer.com profile, or start from scratch with the blog tools provided.   This is my favorite feature! Each person will have an opportunity to post pictures to their own personal galleries, OR to their inspiration wall. Each community has its own inspiration wall, and the pictures on that wall are made up of the pictures individuals post. The inspiration wall is one of the first things you will see when you join a community (create a profile) and it is filled with inspirational pictures and quotes from other people fighting the same thing.   The Medical side of cancer is obviously the biggest side. Here you can rate physicians, facilities, discuss treatments. Does a medicine that you have to take have a side effect you didn't expect? Post it here so that others taking the same medicine will know what can happen. Is there something you do after chemo that helps you recover quickly? Let others know.

In this witty and touching contemporary musical, Dani, a precocious nine year old, loses her hair to leukemia and embarks on a magical journey in order to get it back—along with her imaginary friend Raph and fellow patient Marty.

In the aftermath of a diagnosis, our storybook is designed for young children (ages 0-3 or 4-6) to help explain breast cancer in the family. Why You Should Fund Us  This storybook addresses a need for moms diagnosed with breast cancer who have young children. The storybook will help families and other people in their community support systems explain breast cancer to young children and will be a touchstone for all family members to refer to over time.  We are professionals. Between the two of us, we have experience in education, early childhood development, counseling, creating books, curriculum development, writing, and editing. We are also aware of what we don’t know and we research and consult with others as needed. Our goals are realistic. We have carefully designed this project to have a clear end point. The goal of this project is to create our storybook, and it is an important one. Once we reach our storybook goal the sky’s the limit!  Our budget is very simple, and includes: book completion and production fees ($11,000), rewards for backers and fulfillment fees ($3,000), and the Kickstarter/Amazon percentage (10%). Almost every projected budget expense is significantly discounted, and we will continue to search for local businesses who may wish to discount/donate their services.  About the Authors We are two mothers of young children, living with Stage IV breast
cancer in Portland, OR with our husbands and kids. We come from professional backgrounds of counseling and education (see our full bio in the right-hand column). We
found each other at a conference for young survivors, where we discovered that we had
both created a book for our own kids after not finding the resources we needed.
We feel strongly about this storybook as a helpful tool for other moms dealing
with a breast cancer diagnosis. We have passion for, and commitment to, this project. And
every time we meet, we leave feeling energized, inspired, and excited. This is
a lovely change for us as juggling medical appointments, treatments, scheduling
child care, and waiting for lab results often has the opposite effect! About the Book The Storybook Project was founded to create a personalized book called Mama Has Cancer. The book has fill-in-the-blank opportunities, so any family facing breast cancer can create a book that mirrors their experience. It is designed to touch on the key talking points needed for a child to understand what is happening. This helps the child with transitions and changes as mama deals with treatment options and potential side effects. Families look different: they include fathers, grandparents, siblings, neighbors, and other people. Our illustrations will be designed so that diverse readers can see themselves in the book's pages.  The book has rings so “chapters” can be added, removed, or put in a different order. A sticker sheet is included with suggested phrases to fill in the story. This unique book can be used immediately after diagnosis or at any time during or after treatment, and can be compiled as each step in the process becomes clear.  Our project involves creating and printing 1000 copies of our prototype book. We will also gather feedback about the book from families who can make use of it so eventually we can approach publishers! What We Have  •	the first draft of our book text •	an illustrator with over 30 years experience ready to go: http://www.pennyhoodart.com, and in fact she’s already created a few images!  •	years of ideas for both of us on scraps of paper, in conversations, and now in step-by-step project format  •	a clear project budget  •	a small group of friends, family, and colleagues who are supportive of our project  •	an extremely generous donation by Wayne Paige of Wave One Group with help from Hunter Richards for our wonderful video!  •	a collage by a young survivor mama, titled ""Love, Hope, Family"" that will be the image for most of our rewards We’ve done our research about successful Kickstarter campaigns and have applied this research to our project. We are prepared to succeed.  What We Need  We need your generous donations during the month of October. We need people who believe in this project to support our goal by donating as much as you can. We are asking for $15,153.00. If we don’t meet our funding goal, we don’t get any money (that's how Kickstarter works). Any extra funds will go towards (phase two!) finding a publisher, creating an online storybook site where families can personalize their own book, and getting this resource out to the people who need it.  Every bit counts…small donations are much appreciated. We are grateful for your support.

inspire other survivors and create awareness. When I was diagnosed with stage 2
breast cancer at 31 I was terrified, I felt completely isolated in my situation
and honestly thought I was going to die. I didn’t know anyone who had the
disease, especially at my age, and had survived.  This bracelet will remove that isolated feeling and false
belief by displaying everywhere the numerous survivors who have defeated this disease
and went on to accomplish many things in life.  The color of the leather band will signify the type of cancer
the person was diagnosed with, pink for breast cancer, and white for lung and
so on. The front of the band depicts the true definition of a survivor “ courageous,
strong and inspiring”. Charms can slide onto the band that displays achievements
the survivor has made since being diagnosed and surviving cancer. I may also
include smaller rings to signify the number of years the person has been a
survivor. At this time I am just focusing on cancer however, this band
could also signify people living and surviving with other debilitating diseases
such as diabetes, muscular dystrophy, autism, etc. Additionally survivor bracelets could expanse to include survivors of other things such as domestic violence.   If I can get make this idea a reality, no one newly diagnosed with this disease will ever feel alone
or like they were just handed a death sentence because they will not be able to
walk into a grocery store without seeing the testimony of millions of people that
diagnosed with cancer and surviving everyday.  Thank you for considering to fund my project. ",0.0,282,12,0.0,30.0,8,1,2015,1,1,11,breast cancer,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

Think of it as your friendly guide to learning how to support someone with cancer. Talking about cancer is...well...awkward. Yet, nearly every family in the world is touched by it. Sometimes it brings people closer, but a lot of the time, cancer survivors lose friends or even spouses. Because, it's awkward to talk about and people just don't know what to say or how to be there. For some of us living with cancer, our mentality is more: hold the ribbons, bring on the laughs. And, we wish there were an easier way to tell our loved ones how to be there for us. Glossary of Awkward gives us a whole new way to start having those conversations. Each page playfully illustrates some of those annoying - *ahem* - awkward moments when people just don't know what to say. Original illustrations were created exclusively for the book by Australian cartoonist and illustrator, Simon Kneebone. The book identifies and names some of the most common feelings and experiences of people living with cancer. It's meant to give power over feelings we have but don't quite know how to define. Glossary of Awkward was designed to help people have better conversations about cancer. To take away its power to make us feel so uncomfortable, so we can be there for the people we love. Hi! We're Brendan and Corinne. Brendan was diagnosed with Leukemia shortly after we first met, forcing us to deal with serious chronic illness as newly-weds. Brendan also had to deal with some pretty awkward conversations with colleagues and friends about his diagnosis. Sometimes amusing, sometimes hurtful, he knew all of these interactions had one thing in common: most people don’t know what to say. So, in 2017 we started Uncomfortable Revolution, a media company that wants to change the way we talk about chronic illness and disability.   We just finished our first project, Uncomfortable Revolution Fellowships, which offer paid stipends to writers and artists to develop creative works around the theme of chronic illness or disability.The Urban Dictionary of Cancer is the first of the Glossary of Awkward series. We chose the theme of cancer because of our personal story, but  the second collection of illustrations will focus on mental health. We're looking for backers to help us get this series off the ground. Let's take the awkward out of cancer, and bring people closer together. We need your help to set and print the first 1,000 copies and get an ISBN.  1. THE BOOK Glossary of Awkward is the perfect size to carry around. The book comes in 2 versions - Classic and Deluxe with Slipcase (limited edition)   2. THE GIFT-SET It's hard choosing the right gift for a loved one with cancer (hint: don't get flowers). It's even harder to figure out what to write on the card. We've got you covered. Our gift-set features a signed copy of the deluxe slipcase edition with our custom gift-wrapping, and includes our custom 'Be There' cards. 3. THE POST CARDS You don't talk like 'Hallmark', so don't gift like it. The hardest part of reaching out is knowing what to say or how to help. Our 'Be There' post cards -  a bit irreverent - take the awkward and the unknown out of really being there.  The Gift-set also comes with a pack of 10 postcards that you exchange with a loved one with cancer. You send one post card, they fill it out and tell you how to help, and then send it back to you. Repeat times 10! 4.

Tumorman has Zepto power that gives him the ability to enter into individual body affected with cancer. Once Zepto power is active, he can fight cancer cells within a body organ. While fighting cancer, Tumorman faces many hurdles like complex structures within the human body, cancer cells with dangerous powers, tumor walls, oh and not to forget there are vicious and lethal cancer bosses which need to be defeated!   Tumorman is a one of a kind iOS/Android game. Game is set inside the human body where players can use exciting features like scalpel, immunogun, chemobombs etc. to defeat various cancer enemies and bosses. Other exciting features within the game are educational content and algorithm where players can use collected virtual Blood Bag as means of donation.   We are designing an exciting and a creative way of helping community. We are giving individuals the ability to play and use Blood Bags collected during the game as means of virtual currency to support the charity of players’ choice. How this works is simple, we will fundraise independently of Kickstarter campaign, and players have the POWER of deciding where the funds go. Yes players are the BOSS! So for e.g. 100 Blood Bags would equal to $1 and players would be given options of various charities to select from (example shown below in donation screen). The charity will receive the dollar amount equal to the Blood Bags.  To make it fair for everyone, players can only earn Blood Bags by playing the game. Players cannot buy/trade them. These are separate than the Crushed Points, which players earn on killing cancer cells. The Crushed Points can be used to get power-ups, characters, etc. within the game. Also, we will not be using any pledged money generated through Kickstarter for donation.  We are a team with a diverse background and a common goal of making an exciting product, which relates to anyone touched by cancer in a fun and refreshing way. Ankit is a physician who takes care of cancer patients, Nandish is a pharmacist and son of cancer fighter, and Jay is data engineer with masters of Information System Management and an avid cancer supporter. With our core team in place we continue to seek suggestions and feedback from many cancer patients, cancer survivors, cancer care providers, family members, and technical experts to further refine the idea. Together we plan on making this a really fun and an entertaining game. To make our design and development process a success we collaborated with Team Logic Simplified. They are a group of excellent developers and designers with more than 30-35 games under their belt and combined have more than 6 years of experience in game development.

My name is Zhanna & I`m a translator (I am in charge of localization (translation) of the game into English) as well as an artistic assistant (helping with creation of character images as well as their digital design) working on a cool game called Angry Bacteria created jointly by some of my gamer friends in Ukraine and me. One day, during my visit to Rivne (the city in Western Ukraine where I have some relatives and friends) I was chatting with Sasha about what could make an engaging game for both kids and adults, which was not necessarily all about sheer violence and splashing blood all over. And we came up with the idea of various cells & bacteria in a human body - healthy & non-healthy, harmful and useful, leading a fight. I believe this game will be not just entertaining but educative and informative to the younger generation. And as for adults, who knows, maybe it could be the next Angry Birds? (: So let me tell you a bit about our team:  First and foremost, though not all of our team, but mostly we are gamers and we love it so much that we are incapable of stopping ourselves from doing it professionally: so we make games, and we do it well. Every one of us has experience working in the gaming industry, which streamlines the development process and makes us familiar with the structure of the industry
	We are a diverse group of developers: we have one programmer, one artist, one artistic assistant, three people helping to write and play music for the games, and 8 people who help with all non-programming parts of the project (one translator etc), and of course our families. We all love games, and many of us actually first met on online games like World of Warcraft. However, we are a cohesive unit that works well together, and we know that we will not let you down if you help us. 
 We are developing an arcade-style shooter about a white blood cell defending different internal organs from bacteria, parasites and other germs. The core of the game is complete and functioning, and we are in the process of adding more puzzles and challenges within levels. The plan is to release the game for iPod, iPad (including an HD version), iPhone, Android and PC, but for that we are in need of additional funding: we hope that you can aid us in finishing the production and release of this game by providing between $8,000 and $15,000. The game can be released for free, and we know that a contribution at the upper end of that range will guarantee that we can release a game with great potential.  
	The controls are simple and intuitive: use the accelerometer or your finger to guide and fight with a white blood cell, combating bacteria, cancer cells and other microorganisms to save different organs. Each organ that you play through is a mission, and at the end of each there is a boss encounter of increasing difficulty as the game progresses. At the end of each mission, you move on by using the circulatory system, and in the meantime picking up power-ups for the next level, as well as improving your shooting ability.
	In the style of classic arcade shooters, there is both a score and in-game bonus system. Normal mobs will drop stars, which can be collected for points, which are aggregated at the end of each level. There will also be randomly generated game-modifying power-ups, such as shields, slow-motion, auto-aim, bombs, augmented weapons like double and triple fire, and bonuses that transform the white blood cell into other funny objects while giving it augmented capabilities. All together, there are 15 bonuses in the first version of the game.
 The game contains 5 missions, with each mission split into 5 levels. The first four levels will be a mix of classic shooter and solving puzzles, while the fifth level will be a boss encounter. Each level will have a different background and theme to make for a more visually stimulating gaming experience. 
	There will also be more than 30 achievements, and full integration with Game Center, Facebook and Twitter will allow players to share their achievements with their friends, also helping to spread word about the game.
 Although we have put in a lot of work into the game already, there are still a number of things that need finishing before the game can be released:
1.	Fine-tune the interface
2.	Finalize all animations and art-related parts of the game
3.	Balancing, testing and refining the interactions between in-game elements
4.	Create and carry out an advertising campaign
5.	Continue production in the form of updates and expansions
6.	Finish and open our website
 What we want to create is a series of games that will uniquely combine aspects of different genres, and likewise Angry Bacteria will be a mix of arcade shooter and puzzle. We appreciate that this is a challenge that has sunken previous projects, but we know we can overcome this challenge. Why, may you ask? Because we are gamers, and we have been for as long as we can remember. We have played and explored all possible genres on a multitude of platforms, and have experience of being on both the demand and supply side of the gaming community; this gives us the confidence to say that we know what gamers are really looking for. A game is the joy of distraction from the everyday bustle of life, mixed with the competitive spirit of challenging your friends to keep up with you achievements and accomplishments. That is exactly what we aim to deliver: we want everyone to find something in our game that they can enjoy, something that will keep them coming back again and again to try and beat their highscore. That is why we will continue to combine elements of puzzle games with shooter mechanics, or even racing and adventure games. 
	We have grand and ambitious targets, but we clearly understand what we want to achieve, and how. Games are an art form, and we want to create a series of games that are truly unique and provide an experience that is truly unforgettable like any piece of exquisite art. 
We are asking for $8 000 to ensure that this project gets finished, but could really do some amazing things with a budget of $15 000. We are planning on releasing the game for free, so all can enjoy it once it is out. Please help us to fund this project to ensure that all of the great features we have mentioned above can be included in the first version of this game!

About this project: 

Hello! I’m Shannon Burkett. A few years ago, I was diagnosed with Paget’s disease and triple negative breast cancer. Yes, I had two forms of deadly and aggressive breast cancer all in one boob! And I did what anyone who was fighting breast cancer would do: I wrote a rock musical about porn.* So You Wanna be a Porn Star: a story about sex, love, and rock-n-roll is a story about a young woman who claims her sexuality without hesitation or apology. For all the tongue in...cheek used in this musical, there are concrete themes that challenge societal rules and restrictions placed on women’s sexual expression.

 Throughout my recovery, Percocet and morphine would ease my pain but nothing made me feel better than writing songs about fucking, dildos, and cunnilingus. This was my way of reclaiming my own sexuality at a time when I was losing my breasts. “The Cunnilingus King” is one of the many songs from that musical and I am here** to make an amazing music video that will help launch the musical onto the stage and bring it to the big screen!  We need to raise a minimum of  $10,000 **** in 30 days in order to unleash the video onto the web by October for Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

 *the show is about porn not an actual porno 
**Making me a statistical anomaly 
***really at least $15,000
. Budget: Rewards:  You can 1) wear the Cunnilingus King T-Shirt, 2) sport a Cunnilingus King Tote Bag, and 3) carry a specialized Cunnilingus King Card as proof of your commitment to Cunnilingus. You can be a bronze, silver, gold, or platinum Cunnilingus Card Carrier – depending on your level…of commitment and/or expertise.  Want a tongue the size of an anaconda? You can own one of the actual puppet tongues used in the video. Own a piece of cunnilingus history!

""Project: Invasion"" has been a piece that has been brewing in my mind since 2009 when my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. This piece draws inspiration from my feelings of sadness, irony and sometimes humor in response to the diagnosis of this deadly disease and how common it is in our society right now.  It seems that almost everyone can say they know someone with cancer or have been affected by it in some major life altering way.  Its regularity has made it the most fashionable of fatal diseases.   ""Project: Invasion"" explores the metastasis of the abnormal and brings some light heartedness to this very strange disease. I am really excited to finally get the chance to bring this idea to the stage! And I need your help to be able to complete this new work.

These songs are honest. Some are very raw, written from the most painful moments of my life. Some of the songs are joyful, as I have experienced comfort and peace from God as He heals my heart from the pain.  Noah was just 21 months old when he was diagnosed with Chorid Plexus Carcinoma. He endured 3 very difficult brain surgeries to remove the tumor. He underwent extensive chemotherapy, radiation and experimental therapies and nothing worked. We lost Noah at the age of 4 on May the 18th 2012. He was the bravest boy who ever lived. Please read his story at www.PrayforNoah.com We have asked the hard questions. Why us God? Why Noah? Why do horrible and painful things happen to the innocent? Some of these songs address these questions.  In the most painful and difficult season of our life we have such a strong desire to share our story with the world. We are people of faith. God has comforted us and held us in His love in the worst moments. We want to share this love and the message of His comfort with those who have been affected by tragedy and pain. We want to grieve with those who grieve and give comfort and encouragement to others like we have been given.  You can listen to a few of the songs that will be recorded on the album at: www.johndavidcrowe.com/music Our plan is to use the funds raised to produce and promote the album of songs. We will be recording in Muscle Shoals, Alabama (famous for making hit records) at the Nutthouse Recording Studio under the direction of Jimmy Nutt. Tony Hooper is the producer and will be arranging the players and singers for the album. Tony is a seasoned music industry professional and has a great gift for producing.  The funds raised will be used to pay for: Studio time, musicians, mixing and mastering, production of the physical album, promotion of the album and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the project.  The estimated price for this project is $25,000; an additional $1,625 is needed to cover the Kickstarter fee. Once this album is complete we will seek out every door that will open to us and present the songs and story to any audience that is made available to us.  People everywhere in this world are hurting from life's disappointments. Not everyone has lost a child to cancer and experienced what we have, but everyone has pain and a reason to grieve from time to time. Our message is simple: In the most difficult trial of your life, when you are at your lowest point and life has never hurt so bad, don't give up on your relationship with God. We have found that as we connect with others who are grieving from trouble, we get to comfort them while we are comforted as well (2 Corinthians 1:3-4). Our desire is to encourage the broken-hearted and help those who are dealing with the most difficult questions in life. Our songs are a product of our grief, our growth, and our encouragement from staying connected to God. Jesus stated in Matthew 5, ""blessed are the ones who mourn, for they will be comforted."" We are living proof that God can repair damaged hearts and restore hope to someone who has lost all hope.  Please partner with me and Jessica on this project. Your contribution of any amount will much appreciated. Thank you so very much!

There are many dangerous and carcinogenic ingredients found in makeup, deodorant, hair products, and other beauty and hygiene products sold in the United States. Some of these ingredients that are not even legal in other countries, like the UK. That being said, I still buy and use them - and some beauty products are more toxic than others. Having information and options available gives me feel a small sense of relief, and I put together a small book for myself that lists the ingredients I should avoid while choosing products at the drug store. I made the book credit card size so it could fit in my wallet. I gave copies of this small book to a few close girl friends so that they too could shop and apply more cautiously. It got me thinking, it would be great if this small book got mass produced, and easily accessible to people across the country.

It is the worst feeling in the world to know that the only person who can make the pain go away is the one person who you cannot have to do so.  My dream is to become a writer.  My mother wrote beautifully and had a gift with words.  I believe I have her way with words flowing through me and giving me the inspiration I need to not give up on this dream.   I have made a compilation of poems that I have written since her death, that has truly been the therapy and healing needed to allow me to go on without her.  I struggle with my existence everyday and question everything in my life since losing her.  I have been lost for far to long and I yearn to be found. I dream of one day swimming in peace, drinking in forgiveness, and painting myself in the bliss of freedom that will be unencumbered by pain.   This poetry book I have made, ""I Carry You With Me,"" is a book of poems about my struggles of losing her as well as poems about love, the joys of being a child, the obstacles of life, missing someone, and much more.  I write from many different perspectives about many different areas in the ups and downs to life.  Most are personal to my life but others are completely fiction based.  I go about my days and I get random ideas or thoughts that pop into my head wherever I am and I write them down right away.  Later, I make it into a poem and add it to my book.   This book is my salvation and I have made it in hopes that my mom can see.  I only hope to be with her again and I pray every chance I get that she is proud of me, forgives me for not appreciating her as much as I should have, and knows how much I love her.   If this does not work out on Kickstarter I cannot give up on this dream.  All we have in life are our dreams and love and they are the only two entities that keep this heart of mine from sinking into an abyss.  My parents made me into the person I am today and this book is dedicated to them.  They have been and always will be my heroes and best friends.  I love my mom and dad and I only hope they are proud of me. Again, I am still working out the logistics of my plan for this poetry book but I just wanted to give a little background information as to what I hope to achieve.  I hope you can be a part of my journey and be a key component in my dreams coming alive.  I just want to touch someone's life with my struggles and be a form of hope to persevere.  I hope to give back to anyone who helps me and to anyone in need of help in life by offering my time, money, or copies of this book.  I have a huge heart and all I want to do is help others through the same pain I've endured but it is hard to do so when you yourself are struggling so much financially and emotionally in life.  I refuse to give up though, and I will not allow this dream to die.... ""Grief never ends....but it changes. It's a passage, not a place to stay.  Grief is not a sign of weakness, nor a lack of  faith...it is the price of love."" ",0.0,752,35,0.0,30.0,4,1,2015,1,1,26,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,1.0,kickstarter

I sold maybe a total of 50 copies and I can't really complain about that because it wasn't really good at all. I hadn't had it edited really at all. Then in around March or April of the following year, I met with a book club who suggested that I get it edited because it was good, but it was hard to read. I took that advice and just forgot the idea for about 4 months, then I realized that they were right. Two of them said that they would love to edit it because they had already read it, so I had a few people who said they would edit it, and the main editor.  I had them go over it and mark it up for like the next 5 months, then I took it back, went over the few initial edits that they had done, sent it to the main editor who was relentless, but AMAZING. I got it back again in early January, and read it. There were parts that didn't make it, she reorganized it, and she even wrote her own preface to the book.

This script is based on my true story of dealing, love, addiction, loss, and search to understand mortality, in the short time span of 2 years. Recently re-diagnosed with cancer, William Weinig and I decided to film this movie in real time, while reenacting my real life events. A writer and logical believer, “Damien” aches for a divine answer as to why he was diagnosed with cancer. After a round of chemo, Damien’s best friend takes him straight from the hospital and introduces him to his cocaine supplier. Not believing in a future for himself, Damien decides to partner with the drug dealer. He uses all the drugs prescribed to him to enter the drug culture of New York City, a city filled with lost youth searching for an escape instead of dealing with reality. While selling drugs, Damien falls in love with Elaina. Elaina is a girl who lost her brother to cancer and becomes the only person that understands him. While others pity a sickly Damien, Elaina looks up to him and acknowledges his strength and the truth and beauty in his writing. What Damien does not know is that she is an ex-addict.   Damien befriends Johnny, his 11-year-old roommate while in the hospital for chemo. Johnny has Osteosarcoma, the same cancer Damien has. After the two become close, Johnny dies. Damien cannot understand why an innocent child has lost his life. After Johnny's death, he becomes crushed. He avoids reason and escapes his reality by getting high. Elaina, who did the same thing when she lost her brother, relapses and agrees to do drugs with him. A powerless Damien aches to feel something more. He rationalizes the irrational business of feeding addictions. But, his inability to reason why he got cancer is not something he can deal with. He finds a small, brief comfort from his own private hell by abusing drugs. But although the drugs feign the power of money, sex, and his own emotions, he cannot escape his growing sense of mortality. It’s through this struggle that we can see Damien’s search for purpose and reason. Damien goes through an 18 hour-long surgery to remove his tumor after 8 months of chemo. The doctors test how well the chemotherapy is working by sampling the tumor. The results are not good and Damien loses hope that he'll come out of the chemotherapy alive. Waking up after surgery he realizes that he's supporting Elaina's addiction and it is going to crush her if he dies. He decides to push her away to protect her. He believes that it would be better for her to lose someone she hates rather than lose someone she loves. He cheats on her and does not allow her to visit him after his surgery. One day Bernard, his favorite nurse, tells Damien that Elaina is in the Emergency Room. Damien, even though quarantined, rushes to the ER floor to see why she is in the hospital. When he finds her, Elaina is seizing and the doctors tell him it’s because she overdosed. Elaina dies. Her mother finds a pill bottle prescribed to Damien's name. After Elaina’s death Damien is bedridden for a long time on suicide watch. But the same reason he turned to drugs was the same reason he does not go through with suicide. He cannot wrap his mind around the fact that we are all going to die someday and we have no say in the matter. Damien takes pride in knowing things and knowing why. It's what makes him a great writer. But it is his inability to confront his own mortality that makes him a tragic character we can all relate too. When we are young, we don't want to die and we cast that comfortless thought as far from us as we can. But there is a strength in recognizing your own mortality. After Elaina dies her mother visits Damien. She slaps him on the face and says “My daughter doesn't fall in love with an idiot.” Damien does not want this to be the end of his story. Damien rises from his despair and decides to cherish everything as a blessing. The movie ends with him writing on the cover of his journal “Swan Song, her last great thing.” The audience and Damien can decide for themselves if he’s capable of greatness. I, like Damien, want to be one of the few people whose voice isn’t silenced by the 6 feet of dirt above him. The strength of this movie is that it makes you face the issues of mortality. At some points it can be dark and raw. At other points it gives you hope. The better things in life don’t last long in this movie. But the best thing, love, it has a funny way of living on.",119.58333333333333,838,54,0.1435,40.0,4,2,2016,1,1,22,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

It seemed especially challenging to explain this complex disease to my little brother, or to the children I teached in elementary school. They obviously noticed a person being sick, but wanted to know ""why?"" and ""how?"" this was happening exactly.  As a teacher to be, I decided to ask a big and diverse group of people I knew to give me a simple explanation on what cancer is. I got a huge amount of responses that came from various perspectives. It was interesting to see the noticeable differences in explanations of for example medical students, teachers, parents and cancer patients. After collecting these responses, I wrote a story about a little boy who's sister Mia gets diagnosed with cancer.   Thanks to the beautiful work of Sachimir, my high school friend and artist, the story got its own creative and unique illustrations that will definitely play a big role in helping children to visualize the whole process.

Each of which has made this project (and me) what it is today. Going through this crazy/traumatic/amazing time, the one thing that kept me focused on the positive was support. Support from my family, support from friends, doctors, classmates, colleagues, even strangers on the street. There was one occasion that hit me more than any. I worked in Times Square and if you have ever been there, you know it is nuts. So just imagine trying to get lunch everyday, in a rush and amid a crowd. I am finishing up my last round of chemotherapy - so I have lost my hair and walking around in a scarf - out scrounging for lunch and  just not having a very good day. In the chaos, a woman taps me on the shoulder and says “I am sorry to be so forward but are you a breast cancer patient?” I answer yes and she continues “I am a survivor of 6 years and I have been where you are. I just wanted to tell you that it gets better. Just keep up the fight.” I told her “Thank you” and gave her a hug. I couldn't help it. It was the best thing I could have ever heard. From that point, I decided that I wanted to do anything I could to focus on the positive and encourage others like she did for me.  A year later, I began my five year adjuvant treatment plan and decided I would give myself a bangle for each year of treatment. It is the little things that mean so much and these bangles mean the world to me. I hope they can be support for others and gifts to share that celebrate the life we have! Why mark milestones
Treatment is not pleasant whether it is five days or five years, but we go through this process, because each year of treatment that is cancer-free, helps increase the chances that the cancer will not return. For me, the bangles were a way to focus on the positive and five years on a treatment plan was daunting. It was great to have a physical reminder that there was something to fight for. Some days weren’t great - we all have those - and having these bracelets to touch, really helped. Why 5 years
Treatment can vary for patients depending on their diagnosis but the most typical treatment for breast cancer patients staged 2 is a five year oral drug plan (after a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation). Five year is also an informal but well known marker for recurrence. Meaning, if the patient is clear for five years, there is a very good chance they are cured. (I got very excited hearing these words from my oncologist!) What's the status The current status of High 5 Bangles is that I am deep in research and planning.  I have sourced materials and production, drawn up the 3-year project plan and budget. Now I am eagerly awaiting the funding (from you great people) so I can make this project a reality. The images you see on this project page and in the video are prototypes and will be similar to the actual product. I will work with local sourcing for sterling silver and each bangle will be hand stamped with the bangle name or number. The additional charms will also be in sterling and will have numbers or the ability to personalize with a name, initials or a short phrase.    So what's the timing of all this?

590faec90a63e10ede6327c02802470b,Brewing For A Cure,Help kick start a father & son brewery that brews tasty beer in the name of cancer research - become a part of brewing for a cure!,2014-07-10 16:33:16,2014-08-06 03:01:02,2014-09-05 03:01:02,3400,False,False,0,6,317.0,317.0,USD,USD,1.0,food,US,SD,Town,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/321417490/brewing-for-a-cure?ref=category_newest,"What is your inspiration for beginning this project?: There is a point in each person's life that prompts in them a distinct shift of direction. That point, for me, was when I received a phone call from my father who informed me that my mother had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, and encouraged me to be strong in the coming months because her prognosis was bleak. After months of aggressive treatment through chemotherapy, radiation, and extreme diet restrictions, my mother was finally ready to be flown to a specialty hospital in Boston to have her tumor, her right lung, and a section of her trachea removed in order to kill the cancer that was raging in her body.  Miracles do exist, and I witnessed one of them happen to my mother. The doctors warned that the procedure to remove her lung would be life threatening due to the amount of infection likely to set in during her recovery. My sister and I made plans and purchased flight tickets to fly out to Boston to be there for the surgery, just in case her condition turned for the worse. Six hours into her scheduled ten hour surgery, I received a second life-altering phone call from my father, one that would over-fill me with joy. Not only was my mother cancer free, but she was also able to keep her right lung. The tumor had vanished completely from her body, and a swath of biopsies confirmed that there were no cancer cells in her lungs or lymph nodes.  Why am I telling you the story of my mother's victorious battle with cancer? I love beer. And I love to brew beer. What better way to marry my passions and talents to a good cause than to establish a family-operated brewery that brews in support of cancer research? Project ""Brewing For A Cure"" will allow my father and me to raise enough funds to begin our small-batch brewery (which, hopefully, will someday grow in size); a portion of each bottle sold, six-pack shipped, growler guzzled, and good time had will be used to help find a cure for cancer patients everywhere.  What will pledge dollars be used for, specifically? Pledge dollars will be used to purchase the highest quality brewing equipment including a three 17-25 gallon boil kettle brew station, 30 gallon conical fermenter, beer ingredients, bottles, growlers, t-shirts, labels, caps, logos, production and distribution licensing, funding for the many tiers of rewards, advertisement, recipe research and testing, distribution and shipping costs, and most significantly: to help find a cure for cancer. The profits of the first official batch that is sold and distributed will be wholly donated to my parents to help them with their significant financial hardships arising from my mother's treatment. 10% of the profits of each batch following the first will be donated to a currently undecided cancer research center (suggestions are encouraged!). In the future, ""Brewing For A Cure"" will be able to help support the research of other worthy causes such as Alzheimer's Disease, Heart Disease, Autism, and many others. Pledge dollars will be also used to set up a website dedicated to sales and distribution as well as commercial expansion (i.e., getting our beer into stores near you).  I do need to let you know, potential backers, that none of the pledge dollars raised will be given to charity because such a practice is prohibited by Kickstarter. Funds given on behalf of cancer research will be donated by and through the future sales of our products. To say this again: NO backer dollars will be donated on behalf of cancer research. ALL backer dollars will be used to purchase brewing equipment, licenses, and ingredients.  You have no video, no logo, no brewery name... why? I want my mother to be in the video that I make in support of this project, and she is still in recovery so I can't squeeze her in. We have no logo and no official brewery name yet because we want these things to be suggested and established by you, the backers. One tier of the rewards allows backers to submit their design for our company logo and official brewery name, and so everything is thus far undecided.  Okay so you want to start a brewery; what kind of beer will you craft? This is all up to you, our most honorable backers. You choose the styles, you pick the ingredients, you design the labels (all within reason, of course). We will, however, craft some original brews that we have made previously and with great tasty success (e.g., Belgian Strong brewed with noble German Hops and fermented with American Wild Ale yeast, Brown Sugar American-Double Oatmeal Stout, Bohemian Pilsner, among others). There is infinite room for creativity, palate-expansion, and cancer research here all made possible by you, our noble and excellent backers. Everything will be meticulously brewed in small-batches (12-16 gallon batches- at least until we are able to expand) with locally-sourced ingredients and fermented in leak-proof stainless steel fermenters to ensure cleanliness, sanitation, crispness, maltiness, hoppiness, awesomeness, tastiness. One last thought: I thank you so much for even considering to back this project. It would mean so much to me and to my family that you would help us fund ""Brewing For A Cure"" and to begin brewing tasty beer in the name of cancer research! If you have any tips or advice for me on any of the brewing/licensing/distribution/life-hacks stuff, I would be forever grateful for your wisdom.",52.833333333333336,946,38,0.09323529411764706,30.0,8,2,2014,1,1,25,general,1,0,1,0,0.0010570824524312897,0.0,0.27413697618608085,1.224327882960645,0.0,kickstarter

 In my case, my story includes an amputation of both breasts, 35 radiation treatments and 64 weeks of chemotherapy.
People sometimes say your story is easier to summarize, then truly comprehend. I was in the prime of my life, just 30 years,  I met the love of my life just two months ago .........

I arrived at the hospital and heard: you have got CANCER ........

In one year,  95.000 people get this diagnosis is the Netherlands. Of which a growing number of people between 25 and 38 years.
Whether this is a child, a mom or a dad,  the whole family is affected by this news.

During  the treatments for cancer, we want to give families who are fighting against cancer, a nice Sinterklaas by organizing a musical. Sinterklaas should be a happy day for every family and should definitely not be about hospital appointments or illness. By organizing a musical we want to give the entire family a nice day during the most the toughest period of their lives.

Our desire is to craft an adventure game that is poetic, playful, full of imagination and of hope. This is how we choose to honor him and his memory. - Ryan and Amy Green As players explore the five physical spaces in the game, they will unlock our memories, hear our thoughts, and discover the joy of Joel's laughter as they play through our family’s experience fighting this terrible dragon called Cancer.   The game is designed in the style of a 3d point-and-click adventure game, without the puzzles.  The objective of the player is not to solve problems, but simply to be present in each moment. We have intentionally kept the controls simple to remain accessible to both core-gamers, casual-gamers, and non-gamers alike. The rich audio environments and simple interactions create a beautiful, narrative experience, free from time constraints, that encourages players to take their time. Though the dragon does not appear in the game, his violence is felt everywhere, which makes the gameplay an emotionally trying experience, but one we're told enriches the lives of those who have played it.

In 2010, research reveals that about 30% percent of deaths are due to cancer which resulting in death of 43700 people. Cancer remains the leading cause of death nowadays in Australia. The 5 years surviving rate for people newly diagnosed with cancer is 65% for males and 67% for females. These numbers represent the current situation of cancer in Australia nowadays and they are not satisfying. Almost everyone in Australia is affected by cancer either directly or indirectly and there is not one treatment which can completely ensure that the life of our loved ones are not taken by cancer.  The reasons for my initiation of this project is that I know how it feels to be affected by cancer. 5 years ago, my father was diagnosed with bowel cancer which has the second highest incidence in Australia following prostate cancer. It was the same year of my final year of VCE. He suffered from anemia early that year, however, he did not go to the hospital for a complete check until I have finished all of my exams. My father used to be a doctor in China before our family came to Australia and he knew there was something wrong with his body but he did not want to have any impact on my study because of this. Soon his condition was confirmed and the surgery was scheduled. After the surgery, test showed that it was benign tumor which was non-cancerous. It was really good news for my father and the family. During the following months, my father participated all the scheduled chemotherapies in China which were really painful and he was in a very weak condition. He chose to do the chemotherapies in China because he has all the connections and sources with hospitals in Shanghai as most of his classmates from university are working there. When he came back to Australia, we went to a specialist for consultation and the specialist agreed that what he had was the best treatment strategy in the field at that time. Thus, we believed that the chemotherapies would work and thought the life of our family could get back on the right track. However, the bad news came very soon and we did not anticipate at all including many of his former colleagues and classmates. August 2011, my father realized that he was experiencing anemia again and the check at the hospital confirmed that the tumor recurred and it was malignant. It had a huge impact on our family and we were informed that the possibility of surgery was also low as the tumor was too close to the organ. After two months of waiting, it seemed that we were not totally abandoned by our luck and my father had successfully undergone the surgery. However, he was not in a good condition after the surgery and many believed that he would not last for more than half of a year. After taking the first chemotherapy, he decided to give up the treatment through chemotherapy. He believed that it was not certain that the chemotherapy would completely kill all the cancer cells. However, it was certain that many of the heath cells were killed and resulted in a poor immunity system of his body. He also believed that the chemotherapy was the reason that it recurred. After consultations with a number of experts in traditional Chinese medicine, they came up with a prescription to recuperate his body. He has been taking the medicine according to the prescription ever since and he looks just as healthy as anyone of us now. Many people who know my father is surprised to find that he is still alive and most of them believed that is was not a wise move for him to give up the chemotherapy.  I believe there are many families out there who are experiencing what my family have gone through and I am sure that it is not easy. Thus, I want to build a platform for cancer patients and their family to exchange experiences and information as well as providing support to each other. We have heard of patients attempting to try recovery methods other than chemotherapy. My father is one of the few who have tried their own ways. We believe that we should not limit our choice to chemotherapy only. Together, by sharing experiences of different methods, we can aim to extend the life of our loved ones and enhance the quality of their life as well.

My name is Lisa
Amosu-Smith, I am the proud owner of My Trendy Place also known as Houston Lace
Front Wigs. I want to take a moment and tell you our story.  I started my business in 2006 out of my home for a year and then rented a
small space from a local salon and built my business around lace front wigs.
Because of their natural and comfortable feel lace front wigs have risen in
popularity and are now worn for aesthetic purposes by people ranging from
celebrities to your next door neighbor.Then…things got interesting. After some time I grew enough to be able to
purchase a place of my own and operate from there. Having a space to myself
opened up the window to a whole new branch of clientele: people who needed wigs
not just wanted them; people like Cancer patients, sufferers of
Trichotillomania, clients with Alopecia EVEN people who have lost their hair to
stress, men, women, AND children! It has been incredibly rewarding to help my
clients build a sense of normalcy. They can walk past a mirror and see
themselves, not a sick person. That makes a HUGE difference to them. So…like
any business owner I decided to expand my space. I needed private rooms for
clientele to who needed more privacy. I also wanted to offer the services of my talented stylist. In this way, I could provide actual custom pieces for my
clients without having them to go ten different places. I wanted this to be

out of this world…BUT we still are a small business. The expense of moving and
remodeling the space to fit our clientele needs was heavy. I’m reaching out as
a small business owner with a big dream: to make the transformation for my
clientele both affordable and comfortable. We recently we began offering breast prosthesis and specialized head coverings. Our goal is to become a one stop shop for peace of mind. The money will help me to keep my
team and offer even more services to our clientele, continue to give away free wigs and complimentary makeover services to those in need and assist women with the total look. Most importantly we would be able to complete our non profit status which would allow us to give wigs and prosthetics away on an ongoing basis.  Our goals
is $20,000 but if there is anything we as a team have learned from our
clientele; is to be grateful, grateful for everything and anything. We
appreciate you and we will continue to pursue our mission: to help, enrich and encourage. Thank you
for watching, and remember; gratefulness equals happiness. ",10.0,471,27,0.0005,30.0,12,3,2014,1,1,23,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

The goal of the Art & Soul project is to shed a positive light on the changes that happen to the bodies of cancer survivors and depict it through art of body painting. Whether these imperfections manifest themselves as stretch marks, scars, missing limbs, or other ""deformities,"" these are battle wounds. Behind each scar, there is a powerful story that makes these beautiful souls unique. 
The public rarely gets a glimpse into the vulnerable life of a cancer patient or survivor. This is your chance to see unexpected beauty from this awful disease.

Thanks so much for taking the time to visit our Kickstarter page and watching our video for The Eulogy of Toby Peach.  We're delighted to give you a little taster of this exciting and important show and we've included lots information below about what its all about, Toby and the creative team involved, the challenges and unique opportunities making this show presents, why we're seeking necessary support and what it will go towards, plus the ways in which we hope to involve you in the show's development and future. Here goes... Toby is delivering his eulogy. Join him as he enters the (not so) exclusive Cancer Club: sample chemotherapy cocktails, select the perfect funeral playlist and marvel at Willy Wonka’s life- saving stem cell machine. From diagnosis to remission, relapse and treatment: experience a young man’s journey with cancer in this honest and inspiring exploration of modern science and the human body, discovery of self-mortality and celebration of life! Winner of the IdeasTap Underbelly Award 2015, The Eulogy of Toby Peach started life as a short story performed at Battersea Arts Centre, and has subsequently gained developmental support from Old Vic New Voices, Rich Mix, Lymphoma and Leukaemia Research and Anthony Nolan. 
One in two of us will experience cancer first-hand and now Toby's bringing this universal issue to the stage, in the hope of making a difficult subject accessible to a wide audience and to help others who are affected by the disease, directly or indirectly. The Eulogy of Toby Peach is the true story of his journey with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes that he faced at the age of 19 and again at 21.
 The Eulogy of Toby Peach, Underbelly Cowgate, Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2015, 06-30 August, 2.50pm http://www.underbellyedinburgh.co.uk/whats-on/the-eulogy-of-toby-peach THE EULOGY OF TOBY PEACH is a story of hope, celebration and humanity. It follows my journey with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, from diagnosis at 19 to remission, to relapse and to learning my mortality. It is a first-hand account of facing cancer at a young age, but in a broader sense it explores what cancer actually is, the effects it has on the body, mind and those around us, and how we fight it – aspects I did not know or understand when diagnosed and throughout much of treatment. Cancer is a tricky subject and one that I am taking very seriously in the development of this show, as I am aware it is a personal one to millions and no two stories will be exactly the same. I have been deeply researching the illness and have met with nurses and professors who have offered me their expert insight. I’ve also begun working with the Lymphoma and Leukemia Research Charity and Anthony Nolan to raise awareness about blood cancers and we hope that the show can engage audiences in a discussion on what the ‘C word’ we fear so much actually is.  I’m really excited about the show, after receiving some wonderful feedback so far from those who have read or seen it during its developmental stages and a standing ovation for my first work-in-progress at Plymouth Fringe Festival. Solo work is a first for me and I’m very pleased to have a fantastic team of established and emerging Creatives supporting me in the development of my Edinburgh Fringe Festival debut.  One of the key areas that the financial support I am seeking will go towards is to cover the fees of those who are working tirelessly to ensure The Eulogy of Toby Peach is an engaging and enthralling show, realised to its full potential.  In the longer term, I am committed to reaching as many people as I can with this show and we’re aiming ultimately to take it beyond Edinburgh to enable this, hopefully both nationally and internationally. Realising the show to its full potential at the Edinburgh Festival is an integral part of this journey. It is the biggest and most exciting arts festival in the world, a fantastic opportunity and an essential showcasing platform for the engagement of industry professionals, venues and audiences alike. We are in need of support to help us raise £4000 of outstanding production costs for development of the show and its month-long run at the Underbelly Cowgate, Edinburgh Festival 2015.  In recognition of any contribution you are able to make, we have developed a series of pledge rewards that reflect the unique nature of the show and our immense gratitude! Rewards range from free tickets and lemon sherbets to one-on-one or group autobiographical theatre devising or directing workshops with Toby and much more, because we're determined to recognise and celebrate your generosity and build a creative community around the show.  The cost of developing this show and taking it to Edinburgh for a one month run at the Iron Belly, Underbelly Cowgate is £14,000.
The Eulogy of Toby Peach has been lucky enough to be awarded a commission from IdeasTap through the IdeasTap Underbelly Award 2015. With these funds, box office takings and additional in-kind support we are able to cover costs including our Edinburgh venue deposit, brochure entry, actor and director rehearsal fees, PR, rehearsal space hire, poster and flyer graphic design and transport to and from Edinburgh.  However, we are left with an outstanding production cost total of £4000, to raise over a short space of time! Below is a taster of what your generosity will make possible and directly support: Toby is a theatre maker who is currently the BBC Performing
Arts Fellow in Community Theatre at The Old Vic. Toby trained in Community Theatre at East 15 and has subsequently worked with a range of companies to develop his practice. He has worked extensively with interactive theatre-makers, Coney, where he is Associate Artist. He has created work for BAC, The Roundhouse, The Bush Theatre,
The Roald Dahl Museum and has worked nationally and internationally with the National Youth Theatre. Toby is also a cancer survivor, currently 4 years in remission. This
year he has decided to talk about the experiences through an original theatre show, to raise awareness about a disease that is now sadly expected to affect 1 in 2 of us. Toby’s story is one of hope, celebration and humanity. It is an honest, first-hand account of facing cancer at a young age, but in a broader sense it explores what cancer actually is, the effects it has on the body, mind and those around us, and how we fight it. HUGE thanks to BAC, Centre for Solo Performance, Francesco Dazzi, IdeasTap, Underbelly, Rachel Tyson, Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Old Vic New Voices, Plymouth Fringe Festival, Rich Mix and everyone who's helped us get The Eulogy of Toby Peach this far...

My girlfriend was in the front of the boat in the shade from the Bimini top. I was driving while in the sun. Something was wrong with this picture. I needed an easy moveable, store-able, rotating, foldable shade. Here it is.  A personal universal clamp-on shade device that can be attached to a multitude of objects and positioned in any direction to get out of the harmful sun's rays. It folds up neatly for easy storage.  After Taylor Made Products of N.Y. licensed the patent and started the
design process, we went back and forth for months about the design. I wanted
certain must-have features and they wanted ease of manufacturing. They used one
of the first 3D printers for the molding of the clamp that I changed a dozen
times or more. Finally the engineer and I agreed on the design. It was done.
The first production run was a failure. It wasn't strong enough and broke when
tightened. We redesigned it, made it thicker and used a better PSI plastic.
Finally, we were ready for the market.I
didn't realize the manufacturer was not responsible for advertising. They only
do the manufacturing. It was placed on only two outdoor web sites. Needless to
say, the sales were slow.  Talor Made informed me they needed
funds to make another run of 1000 units from China. I am looking for backing to support the new run. I have contacted the owners/managers of local
sporting goods stores that want to carry the product. They were very
excited to finally see a simple use shade devise. No doubt sales will
be increased with the new exposure. It makes no sense to put
product on display without product to sell. There needs to be
future development just for the clamp device as well. It has many uses other than just
holding up the folding shade.",0.0,338,28,0.0,30.0,9,6,2014,1,1,28,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

Sky Blue are already contributing a great deal to this project; Anne needs a wheelchair accessible theatre to be able to see her play which alone is costing in excess of £6000. Anne’s health started to fail more than twenty years ago. From working full time in her dream job as a teacher she found herself consigned to a wheelchair and working part-time until she was forced to give up teaching altogether. Her late father inspired her to write and volunteer with a youth group, encouraging young people to work in the theatre industry.  Anne also volunteered to set up a new play writing competition in 2012 with the intention of helping new playwrights realise their dreams of having their plays performed by professional actors in a London venue - more than thirty new plays have been produced to date. We also work closely with Mini Mammoth films who offer to make a short film of one of the ten winning plays.  In March 2015 Anne was diagnosed with Myeloma cancer and with the bucket list single wish of seeing one of her own plays in production, Sky Blue Theatre Company want to give her something back. Marc Richardson from Mini Mammoth films immediately offered to help and and produced the film at the top of this page which set everything in motion. This kind of thing is worth fighting for. Struggling with terminal illness is a sorrowful feeling no words can evoke. Making entertainment at a time like this is so important and we should never neglect those kinds of dreams from happening. Without theatre there's a lot less to smile over.
 This is not a sob story but the best way we can think of spending the time with Anne. Time that would be otherwise spent prematurely grieving and Anne left thinking if only she had more time. We have time now so were using it to be the best we can.
 If you can help in any way by getting our story out there we would be incredibly grateful.
 http://minimammothfilms.com/ The play is set in Ireland and tells the story of Maurice and Louise as they begin to question the practices of the religion they have been indoctrinated into. It is obvious, to Maurice at least, that a new religion is called for. Perhaps one that will allow him to perform miracles and heal the sick. He sets about creating one - With thousands of religions existing in the world, who’s to say this new religion isn’t the true one? Jay from Apple Rabbits offered to compose original music for the production. Jay Fisher worked as a Singer Songwriter from 1994 and has been performing as Apple Rabbits since 2004 – releasing two albums: 'King of Anglia' and 'Kilburn State’ and an EP of electronic/modern composition titled ‘Oberkampf’, and released on vinyl in April 2016, on Kilburn State Records and available to buy from Rough Trade Stores

spiritual leader, to leave her tribe and move with her family to urban Michigan
for treatment. Five years into the treatment and still suffering severely, her
husband Nathan now believes that the traditional ways of their people are her
only chance.  Between Earth and Sky follows Nathan and the family as they travel
back to their Omaha reservation in Nebraska in search of the most suitable
willow poles from which they will construct a purification sweat lodge and
ceremonial tipi. He will build the tipi at a gathering of elders that takes
place each May in front of the White House in Washington DC. Inside Nathan
plans to perform various rituals in which he will engage the elders and
together they will pray for healing. WHY THIS FILM? In 2011, after a career as an animation producer, I moved from Bulgaria to New York to work on social documentary films.
Interested in learning more about Native American people and culture in the US,
I immersed myself in the traditions of the Omaha tribe. I met Nathan, Alethea and Zakiah while they
were performing a Becoming of Age ceremony in Washington DC in January and was deeply moved by their struggle to integrate their traditional
lives and philosophy into a modern Western culture they often find hostile and somewhat oppressive. Both Shoshana and her husband Nathan explain that
living away from the reservation is a big challenge for them, as the Omaha
depend on their tribe in order to perform traditional ceremonies. Nevertheless
they have been pragmatic in their approach to survival, following both native
and contemporary methods while simultaneously teaching their two children
(Alethea,13 and Zukaia,14) the indigenous ways. But now, as the efficacy of Shoshana’s western medical
treatment wanes, an even greater emphasis is placed on their Native American
traditions.  The family will travel
hundreds of miles to perform and partake in a ritual they feel is key to
Shoshana’s survival and I will document their journey.  I will also be integrating footage shot by
Althea and Zukaia in the weeks leading up to and during the journey.  (I taught them how to use a flipcam and they
have been filming since March.)  Thus, the
storyline will unfold through the eyes of the two generations in the family. THE NAME Between Earth
and Sky is the
star meaning of  Zakiah’s Native American
name: Nioka Glhezhe. It refers to the link between all past and future
generations in a family during the short moment of the day (sunrise and sunset)
when the earth and sky get together into a red strip of light. The mother and
father in the Omaha family are also called Mother Earth and Father Sky. WHAT DO WE NEED? If successful, this campaign will result in a fully
produced short independent 20-minute documentary film. We’ve already invested in two research trips to
Washington, DC and Ypsilanti, MI, as well as necessary equipment rental.  In addition, post-production services are
already secured and the majority of the film crew has agreed to work on the
project on deferral basis.  The Kickstarter funds will be used solely to cover
travel expenses.  Our 20-day trip covers
roughly 3000 miles. This means that every dollar you trust us with, helps the
film move half a mile forward! The money will be used for: Every dollar exceeding our goal will make the film
even better. Any additional funds will be used for graphic design, promotion
and distribution. FILM CREW Director / Producer: Maria Stanisheva Director of Photography: Dafne Capella Additional Camera: Alethea Mae Phillips, Zakiah Mae

Those who survive often find themselves dealing with a profound loss of community, identity and confidence, with few resources to turn to. On a quest to redefine themselves and defy their diagnosis, Out Living It tells the story of young adult cancer survivors who take on the challenge of rock climbing and white water kayaking during a week long outdoor adventure camp in the mountains of Colorado. WHY WE’RE DOING THISOut Living It was created to document the transformation of people living with cancer as they discover their ability to embrace life while navigating the challenges of their disease. Realizing the far-reaching impact of this story, Serac Adventure Films teamed with First Descents to create a film that portrays the triumph of human spirit in the face of adversity, while inspiring its audience to seek challenge, adventure, risk and laughter.More than 70,000 young adults are diagnosed with the disease each year in the United States alone, and unlike pediatric or geriatric cancer, this group’s survival rates have not increased since 1975. Often considered strong and resilient, the people who fall into this category struggle to find support or deny the fact that they need support.  We want this film to be an opportunity to launch young adult cancer into a national spotlight and allow the voices of this under-recognized group to be heard.WHY SHOULD YOU DONATE?As important as this story is to tell, we need your support to help complete the final stages of our project. Your contribution will help finance the finishing touches of the editing, find the best possible soundtrack, and create a distribution plan to get this film out to the world.

Organic Culinary Chefs, Raw Food Nutritionists, Tibetan Sound Healers, Meditation Teachers and Organic Growers.  Preparing healthy gourmet food for cancer or diabetes patients involves a diet of creative recipes containing a large variety of quality organic vegetarian foods to tantalize the taste buds and secure a lifetime interest in eating flavorful gourmet food for even the most finicky eaters. 80% of what we prepare with are fruits and vegtables. 20% are nuts, grains, fish and proteins that are healthful to the body and compliment the fruits and vegtable dishes we prepare. Raw foods in certain quantities will help strengthen the immune system. Likewise, the balance of healthy foods will help regulate hormones levels for optimal vitamin absorption.  We grow all our organic herbs, citrus, edible flowers used in the dishes we prepare in our garden. We don’t just water the garden, we grow foods with love and intention as well as with you in mind. Using positive words and Tibetan Bowls to emit higher frequencies in the garden have been proven to raise the healing qualities of water and plants down to the very molecular level. By focusing on meditating and the love & care that goes into our garden and preperation, we feel the quality is unparalleled as well as the highest quality mother earth and natures' energy produces. We use a “root to leaf” method to prepare and serve food that's healthy and satisfying. In preparing food for dietary needs, it had to be a team involvement knowing the food needs to look good and taste amazing,  while appealing to diverse paletes. We teamed up bringing a European, Hawaiian and Asian fusion of culinary arts to delight the senses. In supporting us you will not only be supporting a garden to thrive and sustain, but you are also supporting an amazing team of raw food chefs and healers dedicated to providing an alternative method of helping provide high-nutrition gourmet food deliveries in both the North County San Diego area and the Coachella Valley in sunny California. The sooner we hit our goal, we will prepare and deliver to our delivery areas. On a scholarship basis we substidize low-income cancer patients in need of healthy root-to-leaf gourmet meals and juice cleanse deliveries. We plant different items in our garden and expand the gardening areas. The more we grow, the more we can offer to the community. We work with doctors as well as your own doctor for all dietary needs. We make and deliver food with exceptional taste and high-vitamin organic produce straight from our garden and local organic farmers. We deliver fresh cold-pressed juice cleansing programs for healing the body from the inside out. We work with raw food using a ""Root to Leaf Method”, as well as non-raw foods in our healthy gourmet dishes. We incorporate Tibetan Bowl Sound Healing, meditation and intention in all we do. It’s amazing! We will also hold meditation workshops for adults and children, preventative health and private culinary services in our communities.  Thank you for helping us grow and help people, you are amazing and all love  :)",1.0,538,27,0.0003333333333333333,30.0,8,3,2017,1,1,22,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

For me, the success of this project will be determined by the impact these works have on the viewing public.  It is my hope that I can share some of the inspiration that Bre has had on me.  The impact of the exhibition on others who can be touched by her inspiring story is dependent on how widely we can share Bre's story through these works.

The task is straight forward, but I'm working under a deadline. I've been in remission from lymphoma for not quite 6 months. Unfortunately, the cancer is again active and I'll be entering a clinical trial in early August. I want to have most of the recording done by then. The going rate for a local recording studio is 35-60/hour. The Rule of thumb is allow 1 hour of recording per song per person. I have 12 songs and an 8 piece band that's an estimated 96 hours. I'll be recording the rhythm tracks in the more expensive studio but the rest will be done in the cheapest studio I can find. We'll average the cost at $45/hour. If we round it up to $4500 to cover Amazon's fees. That should be about right. Groove Duke's band is a great mix of experienced hands and young lions. We've met with enthusiastic response and this album should be a great start of many fine future projects. Included here is one demo we've done and a bit of our recording session. The funding incentives are fun and I'm totally serious about all of them. Any extra funds raised will go to pay my musicians and make good on my incentive commitments. I would have incentives beyond what I've listed here. But you get the point, right? Although, I am certainly willing to hear any other offers! ;) Remember except for the limited offers, you get all rewards below your level of backing.

It tells the story of 11 year-old  Aaron and his first chemo treatment. Feeling overwhelmed and alone, he finds comfort in  6 year-old Emily who has fully embraced her cancer and treatments.
Emily helps Aaron see his sickness in a different light.  This short film will focus on
lost of innocence, isolation, the confusion that childhood cancer presents. Ocean Hawks Productions hopes to spread childhood cancer awareness through this short film. Help us spread the word and make Rapunzel possible. The short
film Rapunzel is inspired by Ethan and Carolyn as well as the 40,000 children each
year who go through cancer treatments in the United States. Each year,
the parents of approximately 15,700 kids will hear the words “your child has
cancer.” Despite major advances everyday, in the US 43 Children are diagnosed
with cancer. Unfortunately only 1 out of 8 of those children will die. That
means this year around 5000 of those children will not survive their cancer or
treatments. Childhood cancer remains the leading
cause of death by disease among children in the United States. Every day, 43
children are diagnosed with cancer and the average age of diagnosis is 6. Cancer
affects all ethnic, gender, and socio-economic groups and more than 40,000
children undergo treatment for cancer each year. 

Even
with this knowledge there have only been 2 cancer medications specifically
developed for children in the last 20 years. Due to the strength of the
medication 60% of children who
survive cancer suffer side effects, such as infertility, heart failure and
secondary cancers.     Yellow for Ethan https://www.facebook.com/YellowForEthan?ref=br_tf Praying for Carolyn https://www.facebook.com/Carolynprayers?fref=pb&hc_location=profile_browser Our Goal
is to raise awareness of childhood cancer and how underfunded their programs
are. Only 4 percent of the National Cancer Funding goes to childhood cancer
research.  

Children are our future and their voice needs to be heard. However we cannot do this alone. We need your help in order to reach our goal.  Your Kickstarter support is valuable to our project. A film is composed of large teams making sure all of the details come together. It is important to make sure that this film looks great and sounds clear. In order to do this we need to work with talented people and use professional gear.  To make Rapunzel the way it needs to be told, we are going to be working with a lot of talented people on the sets, “the hospital and patient rooms,” the set decorations, “the hospital beds and equipment,” the props, “the Rapunzel story book and the Kemo Bags,” and the costumes, “the hospital gowns and scrubs.”  We will also be working with a talented Director of Photography, “in charge of the camera and lighting teams.” In order to do this we will need to rent professional lighting and camera gear. With your help we will be able to create a powerful that will raise awareness o childhood cancer at film festivals and medical charity events. Please join as we make a stand against childhood cancer.  One of the most important props in Rapunzel is the Book of Rapunzel. For the purposes of our film we will be creating a custom fully colored and illustrated version of the classic story. We will be making several copies of the book for the film and will be giving them away to our highest donors.

It was then at that very point just 4 months prior to our daughters 5 year check up we found out that our 2nd child, our son age 13 was diagnosed with brain cancer.     I remember very clearly the day our daughter was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma and the doctors told us she had the best cancer. I thought how can you dare tell me my daughter has cancer and it is the best kind. Well being on the other end of the rainbow when a doctor tell you that your son has brain cancer and 2 brain tumors at that, this is when you realize why Hodgkin's Lymphoma is the best cancer and what that doctor was telling me, now my son has to battle the worst cancer... I finally understood.     The video in this this project is just a sampling of one thing that was done to celebrate Nate's final radiation treatment. As you can see all of the doctors and nurses came out to give Nate a farewell wave as he got into our dear friend Ned's show car for a special trip to his favorite restaurant ""Steak and Shake"". My book is full of joyous milestone celebrations. I can not wait to share them with you. Since the month of May is Brain Tumor Awareness month it is perfect to launch now.   I have always wanted to write a book to help moms and dads understand that though this is a terrible time in life. You must find the positive and focus on healing. Not just focus on the disease and its crippling treatments. With the grace of God and all the wonderful loving family and friends we have. We were able to created so many wonderful memories and we continue to fight and grow to this day. My children are such an inspiration to others in our community as well as other children fighting the same battle. I want to share our/their stories. I want to show the world how to live with cancer and not let cancer dictate the way you live.     By pledging to this project you would be helping me start the beginning of many additional projects that will help the ones who are really affected. The families, the mom's and the dad's and most of all the sweet innocent children who are caught in the battle of their lives. We would also like to have a line of kids books helping children understand what they will experience so they are not alone as they go through radiation and chemo therapy. Thank you so much for your help and trust, please share this project and help me reach and exceed my goal.",78.0,581,27,0.039,42.39082175925926,5,4,2015,1,1,26,mixed,5,1,3,1,0.008605851979345954,0.0017211703958691911,0.13333333333333333,6.104280548193924,1.0,kickstarter

It's a story of how the love between family can stir up your faith and the entire world that surrounds you. Isabel and Oscar are sister and brother who immigrated together from Mexico to Texas seeking a better life. However, life has other plans.  Already financially struggling, when Oscar finds himself positive for cancer again after being in remission, overdue hospital bills stack up among too many Chinese take-outs.  Isabel finds her solace in her Catholic faith, but Oscar prefers literature over the Lord. He’s found peace knowing that he will not survive this round of cancer, and when he does, he asks Isabel to commit the ultimate sin for him.
 Stylistic Influence Our film will embrace hand-held cinematography, natural light with warm tungsten tones indoors, and the use of small closed-in spaces. Filming on 16mm film stock will also play a big part in the overall look of the film. Some stylistic influences include Y Tu Mamá También, El Norte, and The Wrestler, visually borrowing their use of hand-held camera work, long and meditative takes, religious imagery, and color pallets.    I've always found a deep fascination with religion and how it can affect people in different situations, good and bad. For a period of my life, I was terrified of the unknown. Of death. Although I no longer have that fear, I learned a great deal about my beliefs as well as how others use faith in their everyday lives.  I want to tell this story, because I feel like faith isn't always so black and white as it is shown much of the time in film. Familial love can sometimes test the boundaries of what you believe you're capable of, creating that grey area. It can even go so far to change your beliefs all together.       Writer/Director - Tani Paige Shukla

You can find his work here: http://myspace.com/Timothytarkelly This is a rough cut of one of the songs in the soundtrack: LightsOut Productions Previous Work: How Your Donation Helps Us: Actors - We currently have two actors signed on for roles. One of them is
the writer and director Tyler J Wayman. Your donation will help us pay for
actors and actresses. Not only actors and actresses but talented and well-acclaimed
actors and actresses. Now we aren’t casting Hollywood actors here, but we still
need talented independent actors. There is five main roles and a few minor
roles. Two of the main roles like we said are already cast, and we are
presently in negotiations with two more actors. Equipment – In the demo we used a RED ONE camera and
we plan on using either a RED ONE or the RED EPIC. However all of the equipment
used in the demo was free. We got very lucky and made some connections with
some very amazing people. Unfortunately that isn’t the case for the actual
film. We will have to rent the camera, lights, sound, and other equipment. Your
donations will be a tremendous help in this area. Location – We will be filming in Kansas City, MO and
in Denver, CO. Now we also might be filming in Chicago, IL and Los Angeles, CA
but that isn’t set in stone yet. The majority of the film will take place in a
house. We have been looking into renting a big enough house for our filming
needs. So your donation will go towards renting the house for duration of the production
(one month). Travel/Accommodations – This is another big area of
where the money will go. The cast and crew need to be fed. Luckily we are
aiming for a smaller crew than what we’ve worked with before so that should cut
down on some cost. We also need to house the cast and crew. We are hoping to
cast mainly local actors and actresses, but they all won’t be local. Especially
when we will in Denver, CO we will need to pay for hotel cost. Then there is
the transportation. Luckily we already own a van and enough cars to transport
people, but gas is a factor as well. We do plan on paying for some of these
cost out of our own pockets as well. What We Have: - A dedicated crew from LightsOut Productions who’s ultimate goal is to
create films that entertain audiences and captures peoples imagination - Award winning director - Award winning composer - Locked Script - Budget, Production Schedule/Timeline - Great locations around Kansas City, MO and Denver, CO - IMDB Page: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3854442/",518.9,806,51,0.09434545454545455,30.0,1,5,2015,1,1,13,general,1,0,1,0,0.0012406947890818859,0.0,0.15009704550355835,13.178629914647576,0.0,kickstarter

Two films Heather starred in, ""Fortune-Telling"" and ""Canteen,"" were chosen to premiere at Cinequest Film Festival in 2015. Heather plays Ellie, a kind-hearted, loving, and full of life . She is a young woman who is a realist, for she has had her fair share of ups and down. Although she hasn't had an easy journey in life, it has never phased her as a person. Diogo Hausen has been working as an actor and model since 2012.  He started landing roles in commercials, music videos, as well as independent shorts and feature films. In his free time you can find him practicing parkour, reading comic books, or doing both simultaneously. Diogo plays Parker, a humble, loving, faithful man, who's first priority is his relationship with the women he loves. After the process of battling cancer by Ellie's side things are uncertain for him as 2 years after her chemotherapy her cancer relapses. We are also excited to have our supporting actors, Nathan Emley as Dr. Altman and Wendy Taylor as Caitlin, Ellie's mother. Wendy is a stage and film actress who has performed in New York City, Seoul, Korea and San Francisco. Her short film, Pussie's From Outta Space won the audience award at the Milan film festival and played at the Gay and Lesbian film festival in SF.

Fighting cancer is tough enough let alone the side effects of losing hair from chemotherapy. Hair loss, especially on our youngest, is significant and defining for both the child and parent. For the little cancer warrior in my life, Eva, I wanted to help ease the frustration and fear she and her mom faced with Eva's impending hair loss. Hi, I'm Carole, and I wrote the story, The Legend of the Hair Fairies, where magical fairies embody the same strength, courage, and beauty that I see in Eva and the other young cancer patients I've met. In this uplifting story, hair is replaced with hope and is the step towards healing.   I'm so happy this story is helping Eva and her mom through this tough time. (Check out the short video at the bottom.)  We want to give these books to other kids battling cancer...for FREE!  In order to 'kick this project off' we decided to start with a Kickstarter campaign to fund the professional illustrations (see sample below).  From there, we will use the illustrated book example to approach larger sponsors to fund printing of the books. And finally, we will distribute the free books to children's hospitals.  (I just had a 21-year- old boy tell me he wants to visit children's hospitals to read the books to kids.  How cool is that?!) We are so excited to give these books to young cancer patients for free.  And we can't do it without you! So, to get this going, here's what Kickstarter funding will support: $8,000 will go towards illustrations and design/layout. (No one other than the illustrator is being paid out of this $8,000.)   YAY!  We hit our $8,000 goal!  Now, we're on track for our second goal below! $12,000 raised (if we go over our goal by $4,000!) will go towards printing the first 1,000 copies to give to kids.  (Again, no one other than the illustrator is being paid from this money except for the illustrator who will be paid out of the original $8,000 raised.) YAY!  We just hit THIS goal too!  We're so excited! And $850 has been sent to us in cash for so we're less than $2,000 from our next goal! $15,000 raised total and we will have 5,000 books printed!  We also want to start our Legend of the Hair Fairies Ambassador Program!  With this program, instead of shipping the books to a hospital we will have kids up to young adults hand deliver the books for us and make sort of a 'party' out of it; getting to meet kids, read the books to them, and create friendships. (Once again, no one is getting paid other than the illustrator who will be paid out of the original $8,000 raised.)  Any amount over $15,000 raised will go towards printing more books, project development, website design, getting a Spanish version printed, and marketing and outreach to additional collaborating hospitals to give the books to their cancer patients. I hope you see this as an opportunity, not an obligation, to make a child's life fighting cancer a little easier. * Share this project with your friends!  YAY! (We love hearing people are thanking those who share for letting them be a part of this project.) * And, if you can, make a financial contribution to the project.  Any amount is greatly appreciated because together, we can all be a part of something fabulous! Here are a few inserts from the story: Each night Magdalena and Thistle visited sweet Everly and Pearson and whispered, ""Be well little one.  For every hair that falls I will turn the empty space into hope."" Other fairies shared their magic as well.  Clarisse turned some strands into Courage, to help them in their battle; Liam turned some into Logic, to help them understand.  Sebastian insisted on a few Smiles to make the bad days better, and Fiona said Faith makes the hope even stronger.  Together they made a head full of courage, logic, smiles, faith and hope.  They were the most magnificent heads of 'hair' any of them had ever seen. Soon Pearson could feel new hair growing in and slowly Everly's big girl hair started growing longer and longer. And they were well. But the best part of the story?  Everly and Pearson will always have radiant heads full of courage, logic, smiles, faith and hope.  Because, well...that's what the magic is really for.  ******** Eva now gets to go out of the house a bit since her lab counts are high enough to be around other people.  I took her to a local coffee shop to get a cupcake.  She waved at Ritchie, the man behind the counter we'd met the prior week .  Eva:  ""Ritchie...did the hair fairy visit you?""  Ritchie is completely bald, perhaps a fashion statement, perhaps being a chef, but nonetheless: bald.  Ritchie:  Not batting an eye, ""Yes!  She did visit me."" Eva:  Whipping off her hoodie with both hands, ""Me Too!"" Ritchie knelt down next to her. Eva:  ""I am waiting a long time for my big girl hair to grow in."" Ritchie:  ""It takes a long time."" Eva raises her hand toward his head. ""Would you like to feel my head?"" He bows his head down to her hand. Eva:  ""Yes,"" and she gently rubs his head and then her own and beams.  ""We are the same!"" Ritchie:  ""We ARE the same!"" Eva:  ""The tooth fairy will visit me next."" She points to her teeth. Ritchie:  ""That's true, but now the hair fairy is doing her work!"" He is still kneeling and Eva feels his head again.   They wave and say bye to each other. (Pass the tissues.) **** We knew our story would be for kids with cancer. We knew our story would be for parents fighting cancer who have small children needing to have something to believe in and find hope.  And now, after this conversation between Ritchie and Eva, we know this story is also for the rest of us. Imagine how great it will be if more people know about The Legend of the Hair Fairies and the actual fairies themselves so that the next time anyone sees a young brave warrior, they will also have the words and confidence to compliment them on their beautiful, radiant bald heads visited by the hair fairies. Who are we to help make this happen on our end? I am Carole, a Certified Teacher and a writer.  I left teaching to take care of Eva, one of my students, when she was diagnosed with Leukemia. I plan to go back to preschool teaching full time after Eva is back to full health. My sister, Erika, is my Project Manager and Fundraiser.  She will use her experience, skill and success in securing sponsors to help fund printing and distribution of the books to hospitals.  Diane, my good friend and Web-Designer, is a tremendous help, supporter, and confidant with this project and is the one who opened my eyes after she sadly lost her sister to breast cancer.  This book, Diane told me, will also help people like her sister who could have used the book to read to the young people in her life as she went through treatment. Manny will be our amazing, and already published Illustrator.

Join Susie as she races to fight against cancer.,2017-10-20 16:14:57,2017-10-24 00:48:02,2017-12-23 01:48:02,3000,True,False,1,59,3050.0,3050.0,USD,USD,1.0,publishing,US,NC,Town,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1109167336/susie-tries?ref=category_newest,"In 2002, I began my journey to fight against cancer by running for the Leukemia & Lymphoma’s Society Team in Training (TNT) Program (teamintraining.org). That year, I ran both a marathon and an Olympic distance triathlon and participated in the triathlon again in 2008. Through personal fundraising efforts, I have raised $10,000 for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society to help fight cancer. 

 Since then, these causes have been close to my heart and I became more passionate about helping this society when my 85-year-old grandfather passed away from a six-month battle with Lymphoma in 2012. While I had always felt drawn to this cause, the passing of my grandfather drove me to write the story that had been in my heart for years.  

Susie Tries was developed far before it was created, but my grandfather’s death inspired me to have this story published in hopes of helping others suffering from cancer. Susan Bradley-Cox (http://www.triforsight.com/about-susan/), the triathlon coach for the TNT program in Lexington, KY, was my coach and subsequently mentored and inspired hundreds of other athletes, many who were battling cancer. Her perseverance and determination greatly inspired me because she encouraged all those she met to never give up—a technique she faithfully practiced. Just as I never gave up during training, I never gave up on my dream of seeing Susie Tries come to life.  

Named after and inspired by my exceptional coach, Susie—the main character of Susie Tries—teaches kids that winning does not mean coming in first; it means setting and achieving your goals! In this book, Susie races in her very first triathlon to help raise awareness about cancer. 

 Triathlons at first glance may seem like an adult sport, yet they are growing in popularity among young people because they focus on three activities children not only easily understand but also love to do: swimming, riding a bike, and running. Because triathlons are an excellent example of a sport where winning is about an accomplishment, not a score, I chose this activity to teach children valuable assets such as: self-confidence, motivation, a healthy lifestyle, and compassion for others. 

 Perfect for children between the ages of four and seven, Susie Tries will inspire young kids to set high goals—like curing cancer—and learn to never stop trying to achieve those goals. This rhyming book not only teaches an important life lesson but also shows the principle of never giving up in a new and exciting way! 

 My hope is that Susie Tries will be used in an educational context and perhaps by organizations like Leukemia & Lymphoma to raise awareness.  My personal experiences with triathlons taught me the value in never giving up, no matter how tough life can be.  Every day, thousands of people are battling cancer and striving to make it to the finish line.  To me, triathlons symbolize this strong will to live and the inner strength children need to succeed in life. Though Susie may not win the race, she wins more than a trophy. At just eight years old, she wins by raising awareness for cancer and finishing the race!

Stop trying to hold it in.

                                            -AVA  Written on the skin is a self-curated group exhibition project by three emerging London-based artists. Taking as its point of departure the idea that the human body – with all the fragility, resilience and multiplicity of the flesh – is a site for expression and exploration; the exhibition introduces practices which variously explore notions of safety, difference, innocence and emotional exposé. The project brings together artworks across a range of media – including painting, sculpture, installation and text: these practices are in places complimentary but simultaneously distinct. Softly painted figurative renderings and autobiographical texts exploring queer sentimentalities contrast both installation works whimsically assembled using the detritus of domestic life, and figurative sculptures in the classical tradition which unpick traditional notions of perfection.   When considered together these works, in places visually complimentary yet occasionally oppositional in approach, sketch out a delicate and malleable narrative concerning the ideologies of vulnerability, femininity, sentimentality and feelings of minority and disassociation. These are expressive artists committed to translating their bodily and emotional experiences and for whom their concerns are, emotionally and metaphorically, written on the skin. Their texts – as paintings, sculptures, installations or writings - aim to further our imaginings of the internal architecture of the human condition.  HELENA COLLINS is interested in the artist’s body as muse. She works primarily with sculpture as a medium for the tentative and material exploration of form and context related to the physical and psychological vulnerabilities of the human body. For Collins breakages, slippages, separations and medicines represent a re-evaluation of traditional notions of the human form as represented in traditional canons of representation. She sees the act of sculpting as a ‘physical working through’ of her emotions.  ALEXANDRA LINFOOT is interested in the heightening of the domestic space through the constructs of Fine Art. Linfoot takes items, objects and materials which are commonplace and traditionally overlooked in domestic settings and elevates these through the act of assemblage, dismantling and redirecting traditional associations. In her sculptures, where peripheral elements usually orbit a singular ‘main event’, the everyday household object becomes a site for contemplation and reflection on the aesthetics of personal experience, femininity and the sanctity of the spaces we reserve for ‘home’.  JAMIE SHAW treats art practice as a realm of personal expression related to contemporary lived experience, believing that the personal is political. He works with intention to create intimate, sentimental musings concerned with expressing desire, longing, and failures in dreaming. His paintings and texts examine the discrepancies between sexuality and innocence, and examine the interstices between consumption and desire; marginality and complicity; kitsch and sublime. He counts life, difference, and innocence amongst his main inspirations. Shaw aims to create poetic encounters of a vision informed both by the minority queer experience and myths of the artist as ‘outsider’. The work expresses uniquely personal struggles in desire and constitutes a failed quest for ‘pink utopia’: He says “I work to create my own personal visual mythology: my gods live on a pink cloud.”   All artists graduated BA (hons) Mixed Media Fine Art from the University of Westminster in 2015.  www.jamieshawart.co.uk alexandralinfoot.wix.com hemcart.weebly.com  PROMOTIONAL POSTERS:      ",30.037453466666676,697,29,1.0246153846153847,45.0,3,1,2017,0,1,21,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

Like many men, he knew little about it, but as he battled it, he realised one major thing. Cancer doesn't just affect the patient - it affects those close to them. Their friends, family, loved ones. Each has their own way of reacting to the news and treatment, and patient's survival (or not as it sadly is at times). Geoff's observations led him to write the play 'Hanging in There' and in 2005 is was premiered at the Loft Theatre in Leamington Spa. Directed by Darren Scott, it was commercial and critically acclaimed for it's no-nonsense approach to Cancer within a real-life setting. It's a comedy too, and strangely this allowed the play to show Cancer in a truer light than usually portrayed. After that successful run, Darren once again directed the next production at the Criterion Theatre in Coventry, again to sell-out audiences, and the praise on the production's ability to raise awareness of a treatable, survival cancer (if caught early enough), whilst still avoiding the cliches prompted many people to suggest this should be made into a film. Fast forward to 2013, and Darren and Geoff are discussing how the stageplay could in fact be turned into a screenplay - a different medium, but crucially how to convert the play's conceit of two protagonists (one real, one illusional) onto film. By Easter 2014, there is a screenplay and in July 2014, we shoot the first frames of the feature. Darren Scott is once again directing and filming is envisaged to take place over 6 weeks, with 21 shooting days planned.

They were laughing and crying at the same time. The cast, crew, and artists beamed on stage for the grand finale.  No one would ever be the same.  It was said by more than one audience member, ""I needed that more than you will ever know."" All of this, following the live performance by a cast of 12 offering their poignant and funny monologues, ten performing artists singing and dancing supporting the monologue themes, assorted crew members bringing the show to life, and one very determined and proud MC/Showgirl/Producer, Miss La Pats, in a big red bouffant wig shedding tears of joy by show's end. That is what happened on February 28, 2013 with the live performance of THE HAIRDO MONOLOGUES: WHEN MONSIEUR CHEMO STYLES HER HAIR featuring fascinating and riveting and funny stories from breast cancer survivors, a surgeon, a radiologist, a hair stylist, and a wig stylist--none of them previously trained actors--accented by performances by dancers, drummers, singers, and musicians. http://youtu.be/7OomeKVCmKE (Vickie Smith and Tony Cochran followed by the Columbus Dance Theatre dancers, Jaime Kotrba and Seth Smith) Contribute to our project so we can create, edit, and produce a DVD of the Hairdo Monologues project, rehearsals, and show that brings the viewer into the process, performance, and positive effects of the entire experience.  The DVD will be used as a resource for cancer patients, hospitals, cancer and wellness centers, women's organizations, support groups, and doctors and other health care professionals. It delivers inspiration and encouragement for women experiencing hair loss from chemotherapy. This DVD can act as a discussion starter and motivational tool for survivors, friends and families, and their health care partners. Events and conferences would benefit from the DVD as a keynote feature or session presentation that Miss La Pats can conduct. Compassion, understanding, and humor are at the heart of this DVD.  We have the raw video footage from the workshops, rehearsals, and show and now we will work to edit all of that into an hour long DVD- a ""docu-concert."" The DVD will be inspiring, entertaining, funny, and transformative. Our theme: when we tell our stories and include the arts, we build a community of understanding and support that heals hearts and souls. Pat Wynn Brown (aka Miss La Pats from Hair Theater) and videographer Alan Beavers are working together again to bring into being a beautiful and meaningful and much needed resource. The project and show were the brainchild of Pat Wynn Brown, Miss La Pats of Hair Theater. Her one woman shows play across the U.S. Pat brought her nationally recognized sense of compassion, fun and play into the creation of The Hairdo Monologues. You can see some scenes from a variety of Hair Theater episodes on: http://www.youtube.com/user/HairTheater Pat is a two time melanoma cancer survivor, while her mother, aunt, and cousin survived breast cancer. Pat's family philosophy is that storytelling, humor, and the arts are powerful medicine.  And frankly, they are the best health and beauty aids on earth...and NO BOTOX NEEDLES required! A new area of research and training in medical schools is ""narrative medicine""-- patients telling their health stories to their physicians as a means of reaching a full diagnosis and thereby increasing the immunities and resilience of the patients via catharsis.  Every one of us experienced this catharsis at our Feb. 28 show. We want to share this through the DVD with the world.

       Thank you so much for visiting the Beverly's Brows Kickstarter! We thank you for taking a couple minutes to read up on our vision and see how you can help this business come to life. Our goal is to provide patrons with quality beauty services such as makeup, microblading, tattoos and wellness in the Philadelphia area.
        Rachel (founder) has spent the past 8 years in the cosmetic industry working as an Education Manager for Sephora, a Pro Artist for Laura Geller Beauty and an Education Executive for a skincare branch of Unilever. 
      After years of makeup applications on thousands of clients she started to form a passion for a certain kind of client. Those going through chemotherapy. There was nothing more rewarding to her than applying their makeup. Restoring their brows and lashes left her clients feeling themselves again. 
       She recently left the makeup industry to start a new venture in Microblading. In the same week that she was awarded with the title of Best of Philadelphia Style for Microblading, she discovered there was a new law in Philadelphia. A law which would force her out of the place she was practicing, and push her towards what her end goal and dreams were.
       Beverly's Brows is going to be opening a tattoo spa in Northern Liberties off of N Front Street. One where she takes all the things she's learned and mixes them with several other talented artists with the same passion. To offer makeup, microblading, tattooing and wellness services such as reiki and nutritional courses to the public, but also for those impacted by chemo. The goal is to create a space of beauty and empowerment in the Philadelphia area.
       A portion of each service purchased by the public will go towards giving the same services to someone dealing with cancer.... FREE OF CHARGE. Talk about giving back!
   Unfortunately, it is safe to say that we all know someone who has battled cancer.  We all have seen the toll it takes on someone to go through the treatment process, and the goal here is to help every one of those strong individuals to keep feeling their best. Confidence is another form of healing!   We graciously ask you for your help. 
Each person who donates will receive honorable mention on our website along with other goodies such as swag and services depending on the amount donated. We are looking to raise $15,000 to help complete the location's opening costs. Raised proceeds will go towards certificates, zoning and opening costs, along with the necessary tools needed for the location. Anything raised over the $15,000 will go towards making people feel more confident.      Beverly is the founder, Rachel's grandmother.     
     Beverly crossed over from a battle with cancer years ago. After having a skin graph transplant there was a moment between Rachel's mother Amy and Beverly that ended up being the spark to start this company.
      Beverly was just coming out of anesthesia from her surgery. She had a skin graph transplant from her leg to the top of her head. She was just waking up and was wrapped up in gauze with only her face showing. As she began to wake up she knew that there were family members waiting outside to see her. 
     Amy was in the room with her as she began to wake up and Beverly started trying to say something. It was hard to understand what she was saying but after several attempts Amy clearly heard her mom say ""eyebrows"". 
       She then walked over to her mother's purse and retrieved her eyebrow pencil for her. Beverly reached out her hand to grab the pencil and without a mirror, still in a haze from her surgery, was able to draw on her eyebrows perfectly.
      Beverly's story is not the only one like this. After years of working with patients going through chemotherapy, Rachel has had hundreds of woman tell her how they don't feel like themselves. Almost EVERY time after Rachel has finished doing their makeup and hands them a mirror to see the finished product, they cry. She has heard everything from ""there I am"" to ""I forgot what I use to look like"".     
  Everyone should feel beautiful, everyone should feel supported. Everyone should feel confident and everyone should give confidence to others. 
        We ask you to donate if you can and share this story. We look forward to offering services that will make the City of Brotherly Love filled with even more confidence!
   Thank you all for your donations, shares, and love. 
With Gratitude,
     Beverly's Brows

 Complete Shaping is here to revolutionize the apparel market for bilateral mastectomy survivors. The pocketed mastectomy garments in the market today feature heavy and restrictive elastics along the bra band to support the remaining breast in a single mastectomy survivor.  However, a bilateral, or double, mastectomy survivor does not have a remaining breast and simply does not require a heavy elastic shelving unit.  The heavy elastics in the pocketed mastectomy garments can be very uncomfortable, irritating and even painful for bilateral mastectomy survivors as they lay directly on top of the enormous surgical scar.  Additionally, most bilateral mastectomy procedures require the removal of multiple lymph nodes, rendering patients at risk for developing lymphedema -an incurable swelling of the arm that can develop from wearing tight and restrictive elastics.  Compounding these issues are the heavy silicone prosthetics in the pocketed bras and camisoles which consequently add to the discomfort experienced by the wearer.
 

                               Tank Top with Prosthetic Shaping                   Joan, breast cancer survivor, post-bilateral mastectomy This patent-pending all-in-one garment that we are introducing today has solved this problem by eliminating the tight and restrictive elastics so that there is just smooth and soft fabric against the skin and mastectomy scars.  Plus, the prosthetic shaping is lightweight and built-in, so there is no need for assembling the prosthetics with the garment.  This garment also has adjustable straps for positioning of prosthetics, as well as aiding those with limited mobility.  Just put on the top and go.  This is a comfortable solution for bilateral mastectomy survivors for all day wear for all their daily activities. 

We designed the prototypes and made samples. Our goal is to raise funds to manufacture these tops and help the many breast cancer survivors who have undergone a bilateral mastectomy regain their pre-surgical shape and enjoy their everyday activities in a comfortable and non-restrictive way.

Dad, (that's me) is also a young adult cancer survivor. For those of you who know Becca, you know how brave and beautiful her soul is. From day one of her Leukemia Diagnosis, down to her very last few days of treatment (November 13, 2016), Becca has been on a mission. Her mission has always been to promote awareness and raise funds for Childhood Cancer Research. Becca is currently in remission and is determined to make a difference. Childhood Cancer is a cause that will forever be near and dear to our hearts.  One thing we quickly learned on Becca's cancer journey is that fundraising for a cause is HARD! Anyone who has ever run a fundraiser knows just how exhausing, frustrating and emotionally draining it can be. Over the last two years we have poured a lot of time and effort into raising funds for research, sometimes yielding very little reward. Any time Becca would try to raise funds for Childhood Cancer Research, she would end up disappointed. Her tender little heart just couldn't understand why money wasn't pouring in for her cause. As her Dad, I would often remind her that every dollar raised would make a difference. Becca has always been a go big or go home kind of girl. With that said, she came up with the idea to start a company that gives back. The customer would ""get"" and the company would do the ""giving"". Becca's idea coupled with a lot of hard work and determination, turned into a company called Knots and Arrows. Becca's mom came up with the company name and the idea of selling bracelets. Becca and I have accomplished the rest and will be running Knots and Arrows together.   During Becca's fight with cancer, two inspirational quotes encouraged our family along the way. Somehow these two mantras collided and the company name, Knots and Arrows was born.   Even the material chosen to make the bracelets has a special meaning. Each of K&A's unique bracelets are made from swimsuit material as a reminder to ""just keep swimming"". Thank you, Dory for the inspiration.  Knots and Arrows has been in the works for close to a year now. All designs and  samples are approved and ready for production.  We need your support to bring our project to life. All funds raised on this campaign will cover the cost of production, packaging, shipping, promotional materials and the launch of our website. Any amount raised over our initial goal will help Knots and Arrows to continue to grow. After Knots and Arrows has officially launched a website, a portion of all sales will go to our favorite Childhood Cancer Foundation, Tackle Kids Cancer. An additional portion of all sales will also go to help struggling families touched by childhood cancer, who are in need. Want to follow our Knots and Arrows Journey? Love our bracelets and our mission? Great! Please don't be shy about sharing Knots and Arrows with your friends. The more people who know about Knots and Arrows, the larger our community will become! We are counting on the kindness of friends, family and complete strangers to help us spread the word.

I want to celebrate the peace, joy and love that I believe is at the core of who we are inside as people.  I'm asking you to contribute to a meditative mosaic of 108 paintings based on your submissions of peace, joy and love.  I’m calling it the Gathering Goodness Mosaic. I’m Susan York. I’m an artist. I’ve been painting and making art in one form or another since I was three years old. My favorite type of work is making paintings that tell stories celebrating life, preferably in a series, a book or murals. 

My original idea for the Gathering Goodness Mosaic was born from an experience I had 3 years ago when I was diagnosed with Stage 3C Ovarian Cancer. I sat in a doctor’s office and he told me I had to have surgery in 8-10 days to remove a huge tumor or prepare to die. I was terrified so I asked everyone I knew to pray and send good thoughts to me.  After my surgery with the tumor removed, I had a prolonged miraculous sensation. I was able to physically feel all those prayers and good thoughts coming to me from around the world. I was overwhelmed by the PEACE, JOY and LOVE I felt. I really wanted to find some way to give back to those who had shared their energy and kindness with me in my time of need.   After much consideration I decided to do a mosaic of paintings that would be a physical manifestation of the peace, joy and love I felt right after my surgery. I decided to make the 108 paintings GATHERING GOODNESS MOSAIC to form a mala (a string of beads used to count during prayer & meditation) of positive feelings in the world.  Unlike many other painting-in-a-day projects mine will have paintings of varying sizes from 8"" x 8"" and 8"" x 24""  through 20"" x 20"". I need the flexibility of a true mosaic in which the pieces will be carefully woven together for the needs of the individual paintings and the combined impact of the whole. I am committed to give this project my best work.  What I need from everyone interested in this project is not only your monetary support but your photos, stories and songs that inspire the feelings of peace, joy and love within you. I listen to music and books while I paint, so your suggestions of other art forms to incorporate can be paramount in this project. Additionally if you would like to share a moment or story of your own (in 500 words or less) I’m trusting and hoping that some of the images that I’m sent to draw from may also represent your story too. SUBMITTING TO THE PROJECT: When you become a backer, I will send you an email address I have created solely for this purpose to which you can send your submissions. I ask that photographs be in digital format of 150-300 dpi with a maximum of 2MB per photo or 10MB/email.  Songs: Please submit title and artist or, if you are sending your own music a file I can play on my iPhone - you probably know better than I which file formats work. For story submissions please send Title, Author and Collection if it's a short story.  OR if it's your own story please share it in the body of the email or in a pdf attachment of 500 words or less ( = two typed pages in 12 pt). I will be reviewing/reading the stories and photos to create a cohesive whole looking for how images support ideas and speak to me in general. I will be making a collection of your images looking for overlap to represent as many people's submissions as possible as I weave together the plan for the mosaic. So my plan is to raise money to pay for canvases (prices range from 6-$60 each) and supplies ( I put out about 40 colors each time I work and the paint is only good for about 4 hours).  To successfully complete this project I’m anticipating several 8-12 hour days which will use a lot of paint (a single tube can cost more then $32) plus gesso, mediums and studio overhead including heating costs through the winter months.  Costs will also be incurred in transporting and packing the art work to venues to display the mosaic in Maine, New Hampshire and New York (I have selected these states because that is where my journey with cancer has taken me). Costs incurred to publicize receptions and supply materials on ovarian cancer symptoms to exhibit venues. Songs and books that are not in my personal or public library may need to be purchased.  Costs will be incurred in the creation of rewards to backers. Those who contribute at the $750 or $1000 level may submit up to FIVE images, stories or songs and I will paint something inspired specifically by your submissions. You will have the first option to select this work or another piece from the 108 works of the mala / GATHERING GOODNESS MOSAIC.   It will take me approximately a month to review the submissions, order supplies, make an organic plan of how to represent the most number of images, stories and music in the Gathering Goodness Mosaic to make the strongest statement of Peace, Joy and Love.  Then I will begin the 108 days of meditative painting to complete the Mosaic. I will ready the work to transport to its first venue by July 1st, hang the work, and attend a public Q & A reception. I will return to pack up the work for the next venue, and repeat for the second and third venues.

To make the project have its greatest impact I’m also inviting those who can afford to contribute at the $400 level to select a painting from the 108 created. The first one to donate at that level will get the first selection from the completed work regardless of size or subject (after the higher backers who have the choice of the work made from their submission). 
 I plan on displaying the work so the maximum number of people will have the opportunity to connect to the Goodness I will have gathered from your support. 

Our world is confronted daily with some new sadness. With your help I will create an artwork to battle not just cancer’s struggles but also the daily reports focused on fear, anger and distrust.  Instead of those darker feelings this work of art and meditation will celebrate the collective goodness I see every day in the people I meet. PEACE of heart and mind, the unconditional LOVE of a child or pet, the JOY in seeing the sunrise, a flower open, taking another breath and being grateful to notice those little things.

I will have gathered YOUR goodness and added MY love and passion so it can be multiplied and shared.  I would like to exhibit in the three states of my journey with cancer before shipping the work to my supporters next December. This is a great holiday gift to yourself! Thank you for reading my full story and for investing in the positive energy in the world AND for supporting Gathering Goodness, A Mosaic and Meditation on Peace, Joy and Love. 108 paintings in 108 days. At $22,000... I will upgrade ALL CANVASES to GALLERY WRAPPED( thicker stretcher bars and paint all the edges) this will allow the viewer to more easily see the ""109th painting"" formed by the full mosaic. It will also eliminate the need for framing by those who receive a painting as a reward. At $24,000... I will design and produce a custom poster in landscape format of the FULL MOSAIC so every one can see their inspirations within the full mosaic AND see the 109th painting even if they can not attend an exhibit. THIS is an ADD ON and I WILL SEND TWO of this POSTER TO ALL ORIGINAL BACKERS and to one to EACH new backer over $10 if we make this target.  At $26,000... I will have a website designed that will allow all original photos sent to the project to be animated into the project logo. SO EVERYONE can see and feel their connection to others in the project from around the world. At $26,500 ... I will add essential oils into the ground (colored primer) in of the canvases prior to beginning to make the painting. These will be oils that represent the positive feelings of PEACE, JOY and LOVE.  The sense of smell is the most connected to memory. They are also something I wear each day so it is a way to put more of myself into the work and for the viewer to connect to their own positive memories. The oils are pure and will have a faint scent from the back of the canvas - like smelling a favorite person's sweater when they are gone.  I'm open to other suggestions from backers for additional goals if we need them.",114.31884057971014,1568,70,1.1832,43.275,1,5,2016,1,1,23,general,1,2,1,1,0.0006377551020408163,0.0012755102040816326,0.5,1.224327882960645,2.0,kickstarter

Jessica Peters Malmberg was diagnosed with breast cancer in June of 2013 at the age of 37. During the darkest parts of chemo, Jessica kept getting a vision of a hawk circling above trees, and had an intense yearning to heal in nature, to lay on the earth and look up at the clouds, let go of the shaky fear, of the harshness of treatments, to watch her kids play in the woods, to drain out stress and soak up fresh air.  With this vision in mind we've started A Journey To Heal with the intention of making Jessica's dream of healing in nature come true for our family and for other families going through cancer as well. You can find out more about A Journey to Heal here.  Limited edition 11""x14"" fine art linocut prints. Hand inked and pressed on Stonehenge fine grain paper. Heal - The Owl - This linocut is based 
off a drawing I did while in the waiting room during Jessica's 
mastectomy.  The owl has a strong connection for us with our son Otto.  After he passed in 2008, several friends had visions of him riding 
an owl while helping other children make the same transition he just had 
from this world to heaven.  For me this is Otto's message to his mother.  Heal - The Deer   Some cultures consider deer to be messengers traveling 
between this world and the next. In the month after Otto passed we saw 
24 stags while hiking in Annadel State Park. Each one felt like him reaching out to us.  This linocut represents the love and support of those who have gone on for our healing here and now. We are not alone. Love Thy Self - The snake is often associated with healing - the ability to transmute what is venomous into what is beautiful. After her diagnosis and before her mastectomy Jessica had a vision in which she saw her cancer as a snake coiled inside her breast.  When she asked if it had come to kill her, the snake replied, ""No, I am here to make you stronger.

Directing is my passion and this film will be my calling card to a career in the film industry. We will be shooting on either the RED EPIC or the RED MX.

Are there people who benefit from there NOT being a cure? Where does all the donations to cancer research really go?  I think this film deserves to be made because it combats greed. By showing just how far greed can drive people, this will hopefully show how evil greed can be. This film contemplates GREED and TRUST which are both very universal issues. It shows just how difficult it is to balance having faith in humanity and making sure you don't trust the wrong people. These themes and answers will all be addressed in...

Will greed prevail over the moral obligation to save millions of cancer patients? Will Dr. Rollins ever get the cure out to the public? The budget for this film is approximately $10,000.

	In 2005, my husband, Michael Dubrow, went to the doctors. During his doctor’s appointment he had a physical, which brought the doctor’s attention to a mass on his neck. In 2006, a biopsy was done and there was a 95% chance it was cancerous…thyroid cancer. He had two surgeries done. One was to remove one side of his thyroid gland and two weeks after the other part was removed. It is now 2015 and he has been in remission for 8 years.  My husband and others are the reason for this campaign. We both run a support group and have assisted many people dealing with thyroid cancer.

	It is my wish to get the word out about my unique items. Each of the items will help my daughter and I purchase the materials that are needed to achieve our goal.  Another reason is to get the word out about my own unique creations. In 2010, I retired from the State of New Jersey. I have done all kinds of creative projects, but I have found that I greatly enjoy creating handbags, embroidering, painting and beadwork. I created Liba Davida Designs. Since the creation of Liba Davida Designs I have made many different styles of handbags. I have quilted fabric using the sewing machine, I have appliquéd flowers, and I have sewn on accents such as buttons. It’s rewarding and I’m proud of the quality of my creative work. My creations are on my Facebook page:  https://www.facebook.com/LibaDavidaDesigns/?fref=ts.  Also, look in the future for an online store where the rewards for this Kickstarter and other items will be sold. My daughter, Beth Dubrow, attended fashion school in New York City and wants to honor her father with a collection of apparel, which is 20 looks (37 garments) using the colors of the thyroid ribbon (pink, teal and purple).

I’m Fang, Fab Hatters, a pre-nursing student who funds my studies by making and selling unconventional hats.  I’m a completely self-taught amateur milliner and the income I make doing this allows me to devote more time to volunteer work.  I got the above image from a book, I did not make it, but it is similar to what I plan to make.  I will be making all my own patterns.  More ""natural"" colors will also be in the works.  Eventually several styles of ""haircuts"" will be offered with different lengths and styles. I’m envisioning funky faux “hairstyles” shaped wool hats.  Think of a wool or feather covered hats cut like a graduated bob or other chic hairstyles.  My hats will have the look of a cool hairstyle, but won’t require the maintenance and styling that a wig would. I want to make them for both pediatric and adult patients, but I think they would be particularly popular with children.   They would be available in BOTH ""normal"" colors and in crazy fun colors and patterns.  Placing feather pads on the hats would also make them look more like real hair from a distance, if that was a style that patients and customers wanted.  Each of these feather style hats would require around 25 feather pads per hat. At the hospital I volunteer at, people are always telling me that they love my blue hair and they wished they could look like that.  I think these hats could also become popular among more stylish and eccentric elderly people too.  As a self-employed student I simply can’t afford the materials to get this project started.  I traditionally work with unconventional materials like toys, butterflies, and beetle wings so I don’t have any of the necessary supplies or equipment for this new project, which uses more conventional millinery techniques.  Eventually, I plan to make the haircut hats available to the general public, but I plan to focus first on supplying headpieces to cancer patients at a discounted rate.   There is more research and development with these hats than with a traditional hat, since cancer patients have unique concerns to deal with such as sensitive scalps, hot flashes, etc.  I will be testing other different materials and linings, etc. so that will take a while.  I might put in different linings that have different purposes such as moisture wicking, warmth, or just general comfort wear. I have run the etsy store ""Fab Hatters"" for two years and you can see what I’ve been capable of so far despite having zero professional training and no professional equipment.  I've already had some pieces shown in museums, galleries, fashion shows, concerts, and major publications. I’ve always been passionate about volunteering and my store devotes at least one hour for every $100 we make, but I just couldn't fund this project without any help. 

If this Kickstarter is popular, I'll activate some awesome budget rewards and goodies! Feel free to contact me of you would like to get some combination of multiple rewards.  Thanks for looking at my kickstarter! The amount I asked for in this kickstarter wouldn't cover all my costs, but it would allow me to have the basic equipment and materials to do some research and development and to make a few styles of the haircut hats.  I already have the materials for the rewards, so all the money raised would go towards this project.   If I raise more than my minimum funding goal, I could offer the haircut hats in more sizes, colors, and styles.   The money raised here would go towards various supplies and equipment including:  I’m very frugal so I’ll make sure that your money goes far, I’ll buy used equipment if possible and search for bargains.   If there is any additional money raised it will go towards buying more supplies and further investing into my business and projects.  The wool hoods are quite expensive, $15-$25 each not including shipping, and I would like to get a couple dozen at least to start so that they will have a choice of different colors and styles.  The price goes down significantly if I can buy them in bulk of a couple hundred pieces.   Also more balsa wood heads means I can make more sizes of hats.  The smaller child head size balsa blocks are rarer and I might have to custom order them, which would increase the costs.  I have had inquires from several international boutiques and companies that were interested in carrying my products, but I am unable to be market-ready until I get some more professional equipment and materials that will streamline the production process. If I am able to expand my business, the profit I make means that I could lower the price even further for any cancer patients.  Hopefully if things go really well in the future, I would like to give out some of these hats gratis for cancer patients with financial difficulties. * ITALIAN Backers: I am unable to ship any hats or hat materials to Italy due to restrictions concerning customs.   This hat won Top Toot of the Week at Dragcon 2015!  It also usually goes for a couple hundred dollars. It comes with an elastic and many loops sewn in.  Some of the positions shown might require the use of bobby pins, not included.  It makes a great SHADE hat and it can still be used as a fan too. These style of hats are expected to be used in a series of concerts this Spring.  Light settings on the Cotton Candy Headpieces. ",22.857142857142858,965,49,0.09411764705882353,30.0,1,0,2016,1,1,21,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

I am a mixed media artist who works
on canvas using a wide range of materials and paints.In my work the positive aspects of being
human are addressed through the use ofcolor, texture and symbols to form asymmetrical abstract
compositions.Using multiple canvas
panels my work portrays life, joy, energy, and thankfulness. In this sense I
strive to share my feelings with the community through art that fosters
healing, a sense of well-being, love, and stability.   About Me I’m a third generation painter, my
grandmother and my mother were oil painters and I was taught to paint by age
12. However life moved on and my painting took a back-seat to family and
marriage. By the age of forty, after many years of a dysfunctional and
stressful marriage, I suffered a medicine-induced stroke.Prior to my stroke I was a shell of a human,
I no longer knew who I was or where I was going. On the day of the stroke I
remember thinking “God get me out of this and I promise I will be better at
being me and I will help others.”Fortunately I came out of the stroke with very little damage. After a
period of reflection I applied to the Kansas City Art Institute in the painting
program and through the love, support and direction of others, I was gradually
healed and found my true calling.I
graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting and applied for graduate
school.The University of Missouri
gave me scholarships and I graduated with a Masters in Art History and was
accepted into the Interdisciplinary Ph.D. program.Through these programs I have been around the
world, Ghana, the Ivory Coast and all, over Europe
for research, made possible by the grace and goodness of others. I began
teaching at James
 Madison University
in 2001. I graduated with my Ph.D. in July 2005 and started teaching at
Southern Illinois University in August of 2005.My goal was to open the world of others as a material culture historian
specializing in the art history and history of the African Diaspora and North America.I
achieved my academic goal.Perhaps my
experience in the academe was not as long as I had imagined it would be, but I
achieved my goal there nonetheless. I redefined my objective to teach at a
grass roots level and share my knowledge of art creation and art history in a
non academic atmosphere. My Art Work Art has been a medium of physical and emotional
healing in my life which would not have been possible without the love and
support of others. This led me to establish a community art school in rural
southern Illinois,
the Murphysboro School of Art.Our mission is, to offer high-quality, non-degree art instruction for
every level of learning through practice, instruction, healing and discussion. I have conceived of a series of abstract paintings
consisting of multiple canvas panels in
groups of seven, nine or eleven comprised of small canvases much like a puzzle
but when completed form an asymmetrical shape, not a square rectilinear
form.I have been working on this in my
spare time over the past six months and now require supplemental funding in
order to complete the project.  Your contributions will fund continued work on, and
completion of, the multiple canvas panels by covering my labor and material
costs and also delivery installation costs at the cancer center. The artwork
created by your funding will be donated to a Cancer Center
and will not be sold or otherwise used
for personal gain. Preliminary arrangements have been made for this artwork to
be installed in a cancer center located in Southern
 Illinois upon completion.  Timeline It is expected that the art panels should be
completed by the end of February, 2015 with donation to the Cancer Center
shortly thereafter, probably by March of 2015. Updates will be provided on a
regular basis to all donors regarding progress made on art panel completion.
When the panels are completed and transferred to the Cancer Center
a formal announcement will be made to all donors. Donor Gifts Different size mounted prints and 5 x 7 in. folded
greeting cards w/envelopes of selected canvas panels will be given to donors
dependent upon the level of contribution. The name of each donor (and hometown
if desired) giving $500.00 or more will also be included in the formal
transmittal letter to the health care facility. A placard listing the names of
all donors who contribute $500.00 or more will also be delivered to the Cancer Center
along with the artwork.",37.5,796,24,0.0375,35.041666666666664,10,1,2014,1,1,3,general,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

Hi! I'm Mary. At 19, I was diagnosed with Lymphoma, and went through a hellish couple of years. Yee HAW!

Now being 26, healthy and a writer, I would like to tell not only my story, but the stories of others who have ""enjoyed"" the life changing moments, annoyances, frustration and general insanity that comes with a cancer diagnosis.

When one of the nation’s leading cancer doctors states that cannabinoids, the active ingredients in the marijuana plant, have the potential to prevent cancer, then the time has come for a fully informed debate on the implications of cannabis prohibition.
In May 2000 I wrote the very first by-lined newspaper article reporting that cannabinoids shrink tumors. My story about Spanish researchers duplicating the results of long-lost 1970s marijuana research was picked up by Alternet.org, which still archives the article -- “Pot Shrinks Tumors; Government Knew in ’74”: http://www.alternet.org/story/9257/
In May 2001 Project Censored named ""Pot Shrinks Tumors"" a Top Censored Story of 2000: http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/22-us-government-repressed-marijuana-tumor-research/
Over the past 10 years my article has turned up on hundreds of websites, and it still gets posted, nearly ten years after I wrote it. Recent examples: http://www.cannabisasmedicine.com/story/pot-shrinks-tumors-government-knew-74http://cancermarijuana.com/ http://www.honoluluasa.org/madrid_study.htm
What continues to breathe life into my ten-year-old news story is that mainstream coverage of the anti-cancer properties of cannabis has yet to surface.
""The Cannabis Sutra: An End to Suffering"" will survey dozens of laboratory studies done throughout the world over the past ten years which all describe various anti-tumor actions of cannabinoids. One of the most potent cannabinoids, called CBD, is prevalent in the leaf of the cannabis hemp plant and is not psychoactive like its more well-known cousin, THC.
The book will also delve into a growing trove of scientific literature documenting the potential of cannabinoids as a treatment for many other illnesses, including Alzheimer’s, muscular sclerosis, osteoporosis, arthritis, stroke, alcoholism, bipolar disorder, ADHD and autism.
“The Cannabis Sutra"" will sell as a download for $3.50 on a web site dedicated to that purpose, with lengthy excerpts available for free. Excerpts will appear in English and Spanish, with an eventual Spanish translation of the book if there is demand.Trade paperback editions will sell online for $20. As publicity, I will personally send the ""Cannabis Sutra"" link to hundreds of drug policy and health-related web sites, along with a press release. The goal of $7,500 will pay premium-related costs and expenses for the 60 days that it will take me to complete the book, set up its online distribution and fulfill premium obligations.

Getting diagnosed with cancer is usually a life changing event, and dealing with its treatments and side effects can overwhelm even the strongest individuals. According to medical experts, symptoms of anxiety and depression are some of the many ways the stress associated with cancer and its treatments can manifest. In the United States alone, there are around 15 million cancer survivors, and most of them are below 21 years. There has admittedly been an improvement in cancer treatment procedures and supportive care over the last 30 years. Because of this, 80% of children who undergo chemotherapy survive for over 5 years after their treatment. However, these children are still at risk of long term side effects as a result of chemotherapy. This was the major inspiration for creating Super K vs. Cancer. ABOUT SUPER K VS CANCER Super K vs. Cancer is a video game specifically targeted at children fighting cancer through chemotherapy. It is a well-known fact that cancer treatments can be quite stressful for any adult involved, imagine how much more difficult it is for children. You can view our website at www.smartvideogames.de The objective of this game is to fight cancer cells as Super K, the hero who is a child. Super K will have to defeat cancer cells and other harmful microorganisms till the body is completely cancer free. The game has been widely accepted by parents, children, and even doctors because Super K has to continuously take medication to keep fighting and win the game. This serves as a reminder to children as a reminder of the importance of regularly taking medication prescribed by doctors during their treatment. It also gives those going through the treatment a dose of optimism and inspiration to keep fighting. Additionally, some of the funds gotten from the sales have gone to support cancer research institutes and hospitals. The game is already available on the Android play store for $3.99. WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT One major objective of the game is the emotional and mental development and well-being of cancer patients. And to develop this game further and make it available for iPhone users also, funds will be needed. Super K vs. Cancer will provide therapeutic treatment for children who are recovering from cancer and the effects of chemotherapy and also provide financial support to hospitals and cancer research institutions.

Around 40 artists and volunteers created the first volume of Comics For Good. Now we are looking for support to create even more comics about other topics that are relevant for kids and their families. The topic for the book we are fundraising for is Cancer in the Family.  Everything started when I (Fabio Cujino) listened to a teacher on the radio talking about how refugee kids have a hard time understanding and communicating with their new environment.  Since we work with visuals (Comics and Games) I got an idea of making a book to help these kids communicate and somehow make their everyday better.  We gathered people and sponsors and during a weekend working day and night, we manage to produce the comics you can read on Comics For Good Volume 1. This book is already being used in schools, even though we only got it for a couple of weeks ago and the media is really catching up on the idea. We have been on radio and tv, telling people about the idea of using Comics For Good. That is why we believe that making more of these books might be a way to do good in many ways and to lots of people, specially kids that meet unlimited adversity in their lifes. I lost my brother to Cancer and unfortunately have lots and friends and family suffering because of it. I hope Comics For Good volume 2 get funded and serve as the first step to create a drawn language to interpret life in a way that makes room to fantasy and dreams away from the tragical part of life.  We hope you help us continue making Comics For Good. Here is some of the feedback we already got from teachers using the book: ""It is such a great book you have created, with lots of good and just on target comics. We looked at a couple of stories today in the classroom and they can absolutely create an opportunity to talk with the kids about these issues"" Kirsten Borg Petersen, teacher in Denmark. We have lots of topics we would like to make more books about. But there is a topic we believe to be crucial for many people, specially kids.  The topic for the next book will be Cancer in the Family. We would like to target kids and how they deal with the fact that somebody gets Cancer in their families. We would like to meet them, talk to the them, visit them and build fantastic stories that will take them to those places they want to go to, away from disease, hospital beds and worries. We want to make a book for families struggling with cancer, so they can dream with us and forget the disease and just live.  We would like to make more for more people. And if we reach our stretch goals, we want to go straight to make more volumes with more topics that might help more people.  The big dream is to make a worldwide version of a Comics for Good jam (a 3 days event where people draw comics day and night to create together a book) where we gather together from all over the world to make more impact and increase our chances of making a difference.  This Kickstarter is going to help us make that possible.

this.  Hope Is Growing is a new, women’s
inspirational t-shirt company seeking to attend trade shows and advertise.  We are seeking funds to kick start our
business.  I started with a low goal..obviously we would greatly appreciate the opportunity to exceed our goal to continue our advertising and our mission. I believe our t-shirts are modern and are for everyday
wear.  Hope Is Growing is also proud to
donate a portion of our sales to the National Breast Cancer Foundation.  We feel that when women wear our shirts, they
join together to promote early detection.  As we all know, early detection can save lives.  Each design will have our signature ""trademarked"" name: ""hope is growing"". 1 out of 8 people are diagnosed with breast cancer and
currently over 200,000 are being treated. That is why breast cancer fund-raising is still so important, when you
support the NBCF, you provide women that do not have health care the
opportunity to receive a mammogram. Your generous donation will help assist us in promoting and
advertising to national retailers and attend tradeshows.Hope Is Growing will need to purchase t-shirt
samples, print catalogs, purchase booth items and pay for travel expenses Thank you so much for making a difference.Your kindness and generosity is greatly
appreciated. -Hope Is Growing Email us:  sales@hopeisgrowing.com",0.0,241,13,0.0,30.0,11,0,2014,1,1,20,breast cancer,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,kickstarter

Since I am an accomplished artist of over 15 years I will be designing the art for the shirts, have created the logo, will be creating the stickers and related items, etc.  I have my sister, a very accomplished office professional handling the books and day-to-day office requirements, and I have a printing partner in Kansas City that owns his own screen printing shop were these garments will be made.  He does very high quality work and will ensure professionalism on the creation of the garments. I also have several friends and relatives that will help spread the word through word of mouth, advertising and sales commission.  We will be selling directly to individuals of course, and we will also be working to get these items placed in the gift shops of cancer specialty hospitals and with such organizations as Susan G. Komen and other prominent cancer fighting endeavors.

Big companies spend a lot of money on medicines that treat cancer and if cancer is cured they will not be making money. The thing is that they can just move research to finding a cure for another disease. I will go on this drive to push for a cure for cancer. We plan on making at least 20 speaking engagements along the way. Each donor will receive a map of our route. My dads brother died of leukemia in 1983. His youngest brothers wife has had leukemia for over 10 years. My dad has Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma(NHL) and Leukemia. My dads dad, my grandpa had NHL when he died. My dads uncle died from NHL. My dads aunt has had leukemia for over 15 years and her husband died many years ago of cancer. If I could get in front of the president I can get him to use all his power to find a cure. The money I am asking for is for the trip. It will be a one month long trip. Everyday we will be in a different city. We will have , gas, food, washing clothes. We will also purchase an RV.
