Michael has been a light in our lives with his music and artistic ventures and having that love returned will keep him going strong.


Mike has been battling Colon/Rectal Cancer for the past several months.  He has endured chemo and radiation to shrink the tumor in preparation for surgery to remove the tumor.  He has responded well to treatment and the oncologists and doctors are very optimistic. They are feeling positive moving toward surgery which will happen sometime in February or March.  Mike has performed at every benefit and given to every charity for years.

When Brad's first brain tumor was found six months ago, he immediately had brain surgery (he went on to have 4 surgeries over the following two months).  Needless to say, he was unable to effectively work, though he continued to try - even using his laptop right from his hospital bed hours after surgery.  Every penny they managed to save in the business, went to supporting Brad's living expenses over the next 6 months while he was unable to work.  At the time of his passing, Amy is left with no business and no additional funds to draw from.  (Amy has found part-time employment with another local IT company, and this company has been graciously supporting many of Brad's previous clients.)Julia's heartbreaking diagnosis couldn't have come at a worse time, financially.  The doctors said Amy and her husband Reed will likely be spending the majority of their time in the hospital over the next year, dealing with the actual treatment and then all of the medical emergencies that realistically come out of having no immune system.  After six months of intense chemo, they're looking at possible radiation, although doctors want to avoid radiation in a child so young, followed by another six months of less-intense chemo.  Both Amy and her husband have employers who are sympathetic to their situation and will hold their positions while they are caring for their daughter. I am creating this campaign to help with all of the expenses that goes along  with caring for a child with cancer, and to make sure that Julia can keep her house so she has a home to go home to.  There will be a long list of medical bills, driving expenses, food, babysitting care for Amy and Reed’s youngest son, Gabriel, the mortgage payments and utilities. Amy and Reed are good, deserving people.  I can't believe they are facing this.  No one should be forced to lose a parent and a child, in the same year, to the same disease. ————————-Ways to help Julia:GIVE whatever you can. No donation is too small. SHARE this on social media EMAIL this page to your family and friends - gofundme.com/JuliasFightAgainstCancer  ————————-Please continue to lend all your strength, love, and prayers to this family.  Little Julia is facing a massive uphill battle against incredible odds... all their efforts needs to be focused on BEATING THIS and being able to see their daughter turn 3!I will post regular updates on how Julia is doing.With immense gratitude, Alicia McBride",625851adbb73b36943f16c369028b0bf,35,0.665192,60.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

This is going to be long. Saturday night, March 24- Reggie had been acting very lethargic, not eating or going to the restroom, so we took him to an emergency 24-hour vet. The vet did a routine exam and found that his bladder is blocked, which is why he wasn’t going to the restroom. The blood and urine analysis would be $400 to confirm, followed by a $3,000 hospitalization. We didn’t have money for either. That’s when we made this GoFundMe. She gave us an address of a low-cost clinic to try the next day for the tests. Sunday morning, March 25- The second vet does a urine and blood analysis, along with an X-ray. She doesn’t see anything wrong with his bladder according to the X-ray, as it’s normal size. So she dismisses that problem. She does, however, find that his glucose levels are over 400. An average cat glucose level should be around 120. That’s when she diagnosed him with diabetes. That clinic doesn’t offer diabetes management so she sent us home with another clinic’s address to try the next day. Sunday night, March 25- I get the feeling that Reggie can’t last till the next morning. He hasn’t ate in 2 days. The GoFundMe had been raising a lot of money at this time so we decided to take him to a 24-hour emergency vet to get the process started. The vet overlooked his urine and blood analysis, and came to a conclusion. Both previous vets were right. Reggie has had diabetes for a long time but he hid his symptoms from us. His diabetes had reached a lethal stage where it starts to shut down organs. That’s why the first vet suspected a bladder issue, it was shutting down. Along with his kidneys and liver. She recommended emergency hospitalization or euthanasia. With all the money raised, of course we had to put it towards saving him. He stayed there overnight. Monday, March 26- Reggie didn’t make much progress overnight. His body temperature is dropping. He has hypothermia. They have a heat lamp and pad in his kennel to warm him. He still refuses to eat, so they have him on an IV for fluids. They’re giving him 2 days to make progress.Thank you to everyone who took the time to read this, donate and share.

In addition to playing sports, Jake had also found a passion on the athletic sidelines.   As a volunteer, he was able to use his voice, his high energy and his great sports IQ to announce local high school sports games on cable TV.  This summer, the cable TV station offered him a job to learn about show production.  In April 2016, Jake began to experience some pain in his right leg, his kicking leg.  It was thought that maybe he had overused or injured the leg doing shot put for the high school track team.  After a week of rest there was no improvement.  In the past Jake had also suffered from Psoriatic Arthritis so it was thought that maybe the knee pain was a flare-up from this.  A visit to his Rheumatologist would prove that his knee pain was not due to a flare up, and so Jake was sent to an orthopedic specialist to work on getting a diagnosis. On May 3rd, Melissa and Jake met with a specialist in Boston.  An x-ray of Jake’s femur showed a suspicious area by his knee and they were told it looked like a healing fracture, so an MRI was ordered.  The following Monday, the most dreaded news that any parent can receive was delivered to the family. The doctors said that Jake had a 6.5cm tumor in his knee, and they were worried that this type of tumor could be malignant.  They would need to confirm the diagnosis with a biopsy, and a battery of other tests to see if it had spread. By the end of the week all the tests had been performed and the results confirmed that in his lower right femur, Jake had a cancer called Osteosarcoma.  This is a very aggressive form of bone cancer that mainly affects teen aged boys.Osteosarcoma likes to grow in large bones and metastasize to the lungs.  It is a rare cancer and only affects about 400 people a year in the US.  After meeting with a team of oncology and surgical specialists at Dana Farber and Boston Children’s Hospital the family is now gearing up for the fight of a lifetime.  Jake will go through 10 weeks of chemotherapy right through July. Once that is over, he will have surgery to have the cancerous section, along with a portion of his leg bone removed in August.  He will need to have his knee reconstructed. Following the surgery there will be 5 more months of chemotherapy along with rehabilitation. This will involve many visits to Dana Farber and Children’s Hospital, and a lot of tests to closely monitor the spread of this dangerous cancer.As you can imagine, the expenses for this treatment can add up very quickly.  A lifetime of savings can be depleted in a matter of months with each round of chemo, the various tests, the hospital stays for possible transfusions and fevers, and rehabilitation.  Please consider helping our “Silver Strong” Team Jake by donating to our GoFundMe site.  Jake, like so many other kids out there, needs the support of community and friends to battle this cancer.  Together we can make a difference for Jake, his sister Halle, his parents Rob Silver, and Melissa and Tony Duca.  Any donation amount can make a huge difference.

日本の皆様へ日本語でお読みになりたい方は、右側にあるUpdateというタブをクリックしてご覧ください！


When she was diagnosed suddenly Sept. 2018, the tests showed it had already spread to the lymph nodes on the left side of her neck, groin and in the bone in the right hip area, with small shadows on the left kidney, lungs and liver. As conventional treatment offered no hope, she turned to reputable alternative treatments but kept on working as best she could from home as she is a translator to keep up an income. In December her condition turned critical and her sister Akari (a Mum of 3 boys, separated from her husband and living in America) came to Japan to support Uri, she realised drastic measures needed to be taken.  Akari rallied family, cousins and friends support to scrape together the $51,000 USD plus airfares to get Uri in to the Hope for Cancer clinic in Mexico and she stayed with Uri in Mexico for another 10 days until she came through some critical stages. But she then needed to get back to attend her children and start to prepare a space where she lives for Uri to come home to after her intensive treatment.She checked in to the clinic on December 29thand just in time to have life-saving stent surgery to unblock her kidney function. This cost another $6,000 they are yet to find with speciality surgeon follow up and treatment already beyond another $1500.The current estimates of future basic follow up treatment is another $25,000 USD plus airfares and covering all her own rental & usual living expenses without an income as she cannot work at the moment and currently needs a wheel chair for getting around.  Thankfully, with all the treatment and the tireless support of her sister Akari, Uri has jumped through some hoops and is doing everything possible to heal. If she can continue these treatments she has a real chance to heal from this nightmare.  But with her family’s funds already all but gone, they really need urgent financial  help and her sister Akari will also now be her full time Carer as well when Uri checks out of the clinic next Monday. The clinic doctors in Mexico will monitor and support for a year but from a distance and in correspondence with local clinics Uri will need to connect with in the area her sister lives. It is still undecided whether her best next step is to be in Japan where certain of the medications she needs are less expensive, or with her sister in Chicago where she has personal support and someone close to care for her. Either way, she will be facing way more than the current $30K USD of medical bills due this next week!!  So we have set a goal for 100K USD. Any and all funds donated to Uri will go directly to her sister Akari in Chicago, who is taking care of everything for Uri, including paying for all. Akari will also need to fly to Mexico on Monday to bring Uri home as well as she cannot fly without aid. Uri is one of the most giving, and loving people I know and is the first to help others. She was not comfortable with this idea at first but she realises that if she is to live, she needs to be willing to receive. So from the bottom of our hearts thank you for any size donation you can manage. Every cent counts and is appreciated more than any words can convey.  Naturally, all healing thoughts and prayers are also so deeply received and appreciated.  This kind of support from our greater global family will make it possible for Uri and Akari to focus more fully on helping Uri heal.  We will send regular updates on Uri’s progress. Thank you! Extra information from Uri’s ‘support sisters’ who set up this campaign.To the amazingly generous ""Earth Angels"" taking time to read this, thank you. We (Uri’s closest friends) have set up this GoFundMe page in the hope that, with your generous help, we can take some of the financial pressures, stress and strains off Uri and her family whilst she goes through life saving treatments, surgeries and recovery.   The money will go directly to paying for the life-saving surgeries, both past & future, specific medications for the type of cancer Uri has, the kidney dialysis and related treatments and to help cover some of the mounting monthly costs of consultant appointments, scans, pre and post-operative care, travel costs and all the other ‘unseen’ bills that seem to come out of now where at these times.  We will keep you updated on here status and the doctor’s decision on where her treatment will be best catered for from next week.Whatever the donation you can manage, we cannot thank you enough and tell you how incredibly appreciated it is by Uri and all her family as well. Love and blessings to you all!

Throughout this process Sydney's status as a warrior has not wavered; her strength and positive energy are both admirable and inspiring. In order for Sydney to get the best care she possibly can, she will be flying from her home in Colorado, to New York to be treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Cancer for an aggressive chemotherapy regimen to tackle this disease. Anyone who has been through chemo or seen a loved one go through treatment knows that there is nothing more comforting than being in your own home, a place you feel safe and warm during a time of such uncertainty and fear. That's where you come in. Please join me in raising money so Sydney, the sunshine everyone deserves in their lives, can afford to live near the hospital during her treatment. Any amount you donate will directly help in covering the cost of Sydney's housing. Thank you so much for your time and consideration.Love,Dani",02c5133d8dfa7746f960333b28937926,13,0.5556,150.0,4,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0026455026455026454,0.0,0.05319148936170213,1.16896501488331,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

Even with the hardships he is going through, he always looks at life positively and has millions of reasons to smile.￼￼￼￼What is Hugo going through?Before it all started, my 23-year-old brother Hugo was taking computer science courses at the University of Houston and working part-time at a restaurant. By the end of March, we noticed a mass that was exponentially growing by his right cheek. All of a sudden, he started developing numbness throughout the right side of his face and tongue, ear pain, and inability to open his mouth fully. The condition quickly progressed and after one week, he could not open his mouth past an inch.￼(Hugo taking a test after his first chemotherapy)What is the diagnosis and treatment?In April, Hugo was diagnosed with a chondroblastic osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, in the mandible. From April to June, he received three strong chemotherapy sessions. On July 16th, he had a hemimandibulectomy and fibula free flap reconstruction. The procedure consisted of removing half of his jaw bone and surrounding soft tissue, where the tumor is located, and replacing the missing bone with a section of the fibula, a bone in the lower leg. ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼(Hugo's liquid diet. Mom made him an all-natural strawberry smoothie)In late August, the tumor grew back. Since then, he has been on all osteosarcoma chemotherapy regimen available. No single agent has been able to shrink the size or significantly stop progression. Currently, Hugo has a trache and a feeding tube.(We love Santa)(New Year´s Eve Celebration. Only 1 resolution)MD Anderson closed our doors by sending us home on pain medication. No treatment option was suggested. Hugo did not qualify for the clinical trials in Houston.A surgeon in Michigan committed to performing a surgery.  Hugo is currently being treated at Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak. We are very grateful with the incredible medical team in Michigan. The surgeon, Dr. Chaiyasate, performed a resection and reconstruction that saved Tim, a sarcoma patient.  As it is our only hope to a recovery, we began the drive a couple of hours after hearing back from the surgeon. Air traveling was not an option for Hugo.(Dr. Chaiyasate, Tim, and us)What is next?Hugo will have an invasive surgery. I have contacted several major centers across the U.S. to explore all clinical trial options and treatments available. Once the surgery is performed, we will need to find a medication to provide a permanent solution. Our fight is because Hugo wants to live. And with it, there is hope. What are the costs?The treatment plan materials for the first surgery (plate and screws) cost $8,896. Additional costs include: two major surgeries, chemotherapy treatments, hospitalizations, emergency room visits, office visits, travel and lodging costs, and medical supplies. Our visit in MD Anderson prior to being in the insurance network was $1,500. Since most medical bills have not been received yet, my current donation goal is $75,000.What is our financial standpoint?My family cannot make any more payments. We moved from Venezuela about seven years ago with no assets and have built a new life slowly since then. My dad has a mortgage payment, car payments, medical payments, etc. and ubers as a side job during nights to keep up with payments. He is currently paying $1,000 extra / month to cover MD Anderson in Hugo's insurance plan.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We are extremely happy with all the support we have received from family and friends. Any donations would be highly appreciated and would help us improve our medical financial burden. If you could please help raise funds as well, it would mean the world to us.￼￼￼￼------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------¡Luchemos por mi hermano!¿Quién es Hugo?Si has tenido la oportunidad de conocerlo, estarás de acuerdo en que él es una de las personas más felices del planeta. Incluso con las dificultades que atraviesa actualmente, siempre mira la vida de forma positiva y tiene millones de razones para sonreír.￼￼￼￼¿Qué le está pasando a Hugo?Antes de que todo comenzara, mi hermano Hugo de 23 años estaba estudiando programación en la Universidad de Houston y trabajando medio tiempo en un restaurante. A finales de marzo, una masa se empezó a observar en la mandíbula. De repente, comenzó a desarrollar entumecimiento en el lado derecho de la cara y la lengua, dolor de oído e incapacidad para abrir la boca por completo. La condición fue progresando muy rápidamente, y después de una semana, no podía abrir su boca más de 2 centímetros.  ￼￼￼￼(Hugo tomando un examen después de su primera quimioterapia) ¿Cuál es el diagnóstico y tratamiento?En abril, Hugo fue diagnosticado con un osteosarcoma condroblástico, un tipo de cáncer de hueso en la mandíbula. De abril a junio, recibió tres sesiones de quimioterapia intensas. En el 16 de julio, se realizó una hemimandibulectomía y reconstrucción mandibular con colgajo microvascularizado de peroné. El procedimiento consistió en la extracción de la mitad del hueso de la mandíbula y el tejido blando que lo rodea, donde se encuentra el tumor, y el reemplazo del hueso faltante con una sección del peroné, un hueso en la parte inferior de la pierna.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼(La dieta líquida de Hugo. Mamá le hizo un batido de fresas totalmente natural)A finales de agosto, el tumor volvió a crecer. Hugo ha recibido todos los régimen de quimioterapia disponibles. Ningún medicamento ha sido capaz de bajar el tamaño o parar el progreso. Actualmente, Hugo tiene un tubo de traqueotomía y una sonda de alimentación gástrica.(Nos encanta Santa)(Nuestra celebración de Fin de Año. Solo 1 resolución)MD Anderson nos cerró las puertas al enviarnos a la casa con analgésicos. Ningún tratamiento fue sugerido. Hugo no calificó para los estudios clínicos en Houston.Un cirujano en Michigan se comprometió con nosotros en realizar una cirugía. Actualmente, él está siendo tratado en Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak. Estamos muy agradecidos con el equipo médico tan increíble en Michigan. El cirujano, Dr. Chaiyasate, realizó una operación que salvó la vida de Tim, un paciente de sarcoma. Como es nuestra única esperanza para una recuperación, apenas el doctor llamó, nos montamos en el carro y nos fuimos. Viajar en avión no era una opción para Hugo. (Dr. Chaiyasate, Tim y nosotros)¿Cuáles son los siguientes pasos?Hugo tendrá una operación de alta complejidad. He contactado a varios centros médicos en Estados Unidos para explorar todos los estudios clínicos y tratamientos disponibles. Cuando se realice la cirugía, tendremos que encontrar un medicamento que nos ofrezca una solución permanente. Nuestra pelea es porque Hugo quiere vivir. Y con eso, hay esperanza.¿Cuáles son los costos?Los materiales para la primera cirugía (placa y tornillos) costaron $ 8,896. Los costos adicionales incluyen dos cirugías de alta complejidad, tratamientos de quimioterapia, hospitalizaciones, visitas a la sala de emergencias, visitas al consultorio, gastos de viaje y hospedaje y suministros médicos. Nuestra visita en MD Anderson antes de estar en la red de seguros fue de $ 1,500. Como la mayoría de las facturas médicas aún no se han recibido, mi meta actual de donación es $75,000.¿Cuál es nuestra posición económica actual?Actualmente, mi familia está en un punto en el que económicamente no está en la posibilidad de realizar más pagos. Nos mudamos de Venezuela hace siete años y poco a poco hemos construído una vida aquí desde cero. Mi papá tiene que pagar la hipoteca de la casa, el crédito de los carros, pagos médicos, etc. y además de su trabajo oficial, maneja para uber por la noches para poder con todos los gastos.  Mi  papá actualmente está pagando $ 1,000 extra por mes para cubrir a MD Anderson en el plan de seguro de Hugo.---------------------------------Estamos extremadamente agradecidos por todo el apoyo que hemos recibido de nuestra familia y amigos. Estaríamos muy agradecidos por cualquier donación, ya que nos ayudaría poder pagar todos los gastos de la clínica que el seguro médico no nos cubre.

Then when her boyfriend, Victor, arrived home from work at 3am they decided to go to the emergency room. It was the night before Halloween and it would change her life forever. They arrived to the emergency room and they proceeded with the routine checks, and decided to do a chest x-ray to confirm she did not have pneumonia.  This when my sister received the news that she had a mass the size golf ball located on her left lung directly behind her heart.  It was determined the mass was pressing on her lung, and the pressure and tension caused her to have bronchitis.  By November 6th she was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. She was then advised her mass had grew to the size of the palm of her hand and slightly putting pressure on her heart. She began her chemo treatment the next following week.  She currently goes in for chemo treatment every three weeks for five hours.  She decided to take the full nine-months off.  It was explained to her after a chemo treatment she will need to stay away from anyone who is sick.  The outcome of her catching any kind of sickness from someone would be significant because of the state of her weak immune system.  Giving her position as a SRO (School Resource Officer), it puts her at risk of catching some kind of sickness, or even working with her fellow Officers. Through all of this she has been strong and staying positive.  I was so proud of her when she made the decision to shave off all her hair.  If you know her personally, her hair meant everything to her.  She has been growing out since a being a child and before cutting off it was down to her waist.   I am seeking help for all the future cost she will incur and recent bills that have occurred.  As of right now she only has enough paid leave to last her a few months, my father and I will take on her expenses after that.  Once all the treatment is finished and there is a clean bill of health, she has to pay for medical test every six months for the next five years.         It means a lot to me that you took the time to read this! I am trying to be the good “Big Brother” and take care of my little sister. Besides being my blood sister, she is also my blue sister.  I used to serve the same Police Department with my sister before moving onto a different agency.  The help would also take a lot of burden off of our father.  He is not the one to ever complain and would give up everything he has to take care of his little girl.  Our parents drives to see her every week on their days off to keep her company and make sure she is fed.  Please reach out to me if there are any questions.  Again, I appreciate that YOU took the time to read over all this and it means the world to us.  Thank you to everyone who donates!!!!!!",9667aa66d40fcac9ba71c52d16cdf892,45,1.0234,14.0,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Fortunately, after this treatment, cancer disappeared for a while, and although it was a traumatic and exhausting experience —both emotionally and financially— my mother returned to her daily life, taking her medications and doing all the routine checkups needed every few months.For almost two years these tests yielded negative results until the end of this November when the doctors found a tissue in her breasts that turned out to be a lobular breast malignant tumor. Given her background as a cancer survivor, his doctor recommended that she should immediately undergo surgery again to prevent it from spreading throughout the body.Because of the urgency of the procedure, I gathered all the money I had in the bank so that within a few days she could enter the operating room as directed. The tumor was successfully removed, and we are just awaiting results from the biopsy in order to confirm it’s not spreaded, but my mom is already recovering, although she is still not at home. However, even though we were able to take care of the minimum necessary to make the hospital accept her as a patient, the amount of the medical bills exceeds all the fundings product of the combination of my solely work income plus the collaboration of a few friends who have helped us until this moment with the greatest discretion.Unfortunately, the full payment of the remaining invoices is required immediately. That is why despite having allocated all of our savings and salary to this task, we need to do this fundraiser to complete the necessary amount to cover these expenses as soon as possible.The funds will be used to pay for the operation, as well as to cover the post-operative treatment, including all the medicines and tests after the biopsy.Luckily, my mom is a warrior who has faced all of this without losing the giant smile that characterizes her.I want to thank everyone in advance for all your contributions and good wishes to her.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luego de vencer el cáncer de cuello uterino en 2016, el 20 de Noviembre de este año mi mamá Omaira Ávila, de 69 años, fue diagnosticada de nuevo, esta vez de cáncer de seno.Para el primer tumor, a mi mamá tuvo que hacérsele una histerectomía, así como un costoso tratamiento de radioterapia que se extendió por meses. Por fortuna, después de este tratamiento el cáncer desapareció por un tiempo, y aunque fue una experiencia traumática y desgastante —tanto emocional como financieramente—, mi mamá regresó a la cotidianidad tomándose sus medicamentos y haciéndose los chequeos de rutina con disciplina cada varios meses.Durante casi dos años estos exámenes arrojaron resultados regativos, hasta que a finales de Noviembre le encontraron un tejido en el seno que resultó ser un tumor lobular mamario maligno, y que dado sus antecedentes, su médico recomendó que debía ser intervenido quirúrgicamente de inmediato para evitar que se le extendiera por todo el cuerpo.En vista de la urgencia de la operación, dispuse de todo el dinero que tenía disponible en el banco para que a los pocos días pudiese entrar en el quirófano. El tumor fue removido con éxito, y aunque todavía esperamos resultados de la biopsia para confirmar que no se ha extendido, mi mamá ya está recuperándose, aunque todavía no está en su casa. Sin embargo, a pesar de que pudimos hacernos cargo de lo mínimo necesario para que aceptaran operarla, el monto de las facturas médicas supera al de la suma de mi salario más la colaboración de unos pocos amigos que han sabido ayudarme monetariamente con la mayor discreción hasta este momento.Lamentablemente, el pago del resto de las facturas es requerido de inmediato. Es por eso que a pesar de haber destinado todos nuestros ahorros e ingresos actuales  a esta tarea, nos vemos obligados a hacer una recaudación por esta vía para completar el monto necesario y solventar estos gastos por completo lo antes posible.Los fondos estarán destinados al pago de lo que resta de la operación, así como para cubrir el tratamiento posterior a la operación, incluyendo medicinas y exámenes luego de la biopsia.Por suerte, mi mamá es una guerrera que se ha enfrentado a todo esto sin perder la enorme sonrisa que la caracteriza.De antemano quiero agradecerles a todos por sus colaboraciones y sus buenos deseos para con ella.",14bf8e90d06b6fca4a49c8d761940606,10,0.9497916666666667,30.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

That’s how it started. I had spent the weekend in Vermont skiing; visiting with old friends and classmates; and had nailed the job interview I’d made the trip up from Atlanta for—my first since finishing grad school a few months prior. I thought my life was about to take a turn for the better. But at 1:45am, as blood poured out of my body in sheets, a terrifying reality struck: I was alone, 1200 miles from home, unemployed, without health insurance, and in serious trouble. A short call to the only open hospital I could find made me realize something else: I needed to be home, near my family to face this crisis. So, I did the only thing I could think of: I prayed to God for the bleeding to stop. And then it did.A few hours later, I called on God again to give me strength to zip my suitcase; to give me strength to get my suitcase to my rental car; to give me strength to get to the airport; to give me strength to get to ticketing. Each step required more energy than I had to give. My heart pounded in my ears. More than once, I stopped to catch my breath, arms braced on my white rolling suitcase for support. How had skiing been so effortless only the day before? The Chicago Marathon felt easier than this. When I landed in Atlanta at 9:30, my stepfather met me at baggage claim and took me straight to the emergency room. Within two hours of arrival, I had been admitted.  A nurse wheeled me from Emergency and to a private room pushing the beeping heart rate monitor and the saline IV attached to my chest and arm. ""I don’t belong here, I thought."" A hospital is for sick people. For three days I endured endless tests, nurses in and out of my room at all hours of the day and night; latexed and lubed fingers poked my ass; needles stuck in my arm; humiliating and invasive questions about my health history; terrible hospital food, and starvation. “You need a blood transfusion,” they told me. “You’re severely anemic.” The normal blood count range for a female of my weight and age is 12-14. Mine hovered around 6. The next morning, doctors scheduled me for an emergency colonoscopy—the first of three I would endure over the coming month. When I woke from anesthesia after the procedure, my mother and sister were standing at the end of the bed when the surgeon said, “We found a tumor.”  My response was flat, perhaps because I was still drug-induced. “I know,” I said. “I knew that was there.” I thought I had hemorrhoids. A few hours later, they wheeled me to my first of two CT scans and scheduled the first of two MRIs. Images taken the first week of December revealed no detectable tumors in my liver or lungs, but did reveal a mass the size of an orange midway up my rectum, resting against my uterus. Based off the MRI imaging, on December 18th, they diagnosed me with Stage 3 adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Initial tests reported two lymph nodes involved. The tumor had penetrated all the way through the third layer of my colon. Metastasis could be imminent. Merry Christmas to me. No one wants to talk about the realities of cancer, especially colorectal cancer. No one wants to imagine what it looks like, or what it feels like, or what to do if it happens to them. I never imagined it would happen to me. But here’s the thing… it’s not the cancer that scares me. It’s the cancer treatment. Doctors recommend a total of 32 weeks of chemotherapy, five weeks of radiation, then a highly invasive surgery that will leave me with an ileostomy bag for six months. They tell me that I am in the curative phase, but then they tell me they can’t guarantee the cancer won’t come back. The long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation have me frozen in place, unable to accept that my only chances of survival are dousing my system with near-toxic levels of a substance originally derived from mustard gas.  Chemotherapy liquid that spills during IV administration, and any amount remaining following an injection, is treated as hazardous waste! Nurses dispensing the substance must wear protective clothing and masks… So how is it safe to inject directly in my veins???  Furthermore, according to the results of a 14-year study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in December of 2004 called, The Contribution of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy to 5-year Survival in Adult Malignancies , “the overall contribution of curative and adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to 5-year survival in adults was estimated to be 2.3% in Australia and just 2.1% in the USA.” Their conclusion stated that chemotherapy only makes a “minor contribution” to long-term survival. A minor contribution to survival, BUT life changing side effects to boot. Besides the chances of developing secondary cancers as a result of chemotherapy, some side effects include: sensitivity to sunlight, which may or may not go away, hair loss, loss of appetite, nausea, unusual tiredness or fatigue, dizziness, “chemo brain”—described as mental disorientation, brain fog, and cognitive impairment —which can last for years, changes in vision, sores in mouth or throat, diarrhea, vomiting, impaired immune system function, rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing/swallowing, nosebleeds, coughing up or vomiting blood or material that looks like coffee grounds (WTF?!), pink, red, or dark brown urine, unusual bleeding or bruising, and neuropathy—which could be permanent. Neuropathy is tingling in the hands or feet that renders a person unable to perform basic functions like zip a zipper or button a shirt. I’m a writer, so I pretty much need to be able to feel my fingers. Oh… and then there’s the side effect of infertility and sexual dysfunction. Also permanent. I may be on the slow track at 35-years old, but my long-term dreams always included being a wife and a mother. I guess I’ll need to re-think that. The FDA isn’t required to list emotional side effects of drugs, therefore they aren’t required warn you that weathering such symptoms may lead to depression, loss of identity, and extreme despair.To combat the side effects of the potentially deadly drug, doctors do exactly what you think… prescribe more drugs, which have—you guessed it—more side effects. To further the case against chemo, approximately 10-30% of people have a gene mutation that makes chemotherapy deadly at any given dose… meaning, even a little bit can kill you. And the only way to determine if you have this particular gene mutation is genetic testing (RGCC test, Caris test). So, I asked my oncologist, who urgently suggested I begin treatment immediately, if she planned on giving me this particular genetic test. Her answer? No —at least not until after treatment begins. That seems a little late and too big a risk for me to take, but this is the STANDARD OF CARE for cancer treatment in the United States. (For more information on the risks of chemotherapy, visit  https://www.know-the-risk-of-5fu-chemotherapy.com/. 5-FU  is the shorthand name for Fluorouracil, the drug my doctor has prescribed for me, and a common drug used in the treatment of several cancers.)Between the two rounds of neoadjuvent induction chemotherapy, each 12 to 16-weeks long, I would undergo five weeks of radiation therapy to shrink the tumor. In addition to carrying it’s own boatload of hefty side effects, high levels of radiation can cause secondary cancers as well—a new type of cancer that develops as a result of the primary cancer treatment. A new cancer from a primary cancer treatment! What’s the point? While advancements in medicine do include the benefits of targeted radiation, my tumor is in my pelvic region—a highly sensitive area of the human body packed with lots and lots of very sensitive organs. If chemotherapy doesn’t kill all the remaining eggs in my ovaries, five weeks of radiation certainly will. Other side effects include: diarrhea, rectal bleeding, bladder and vaginal irritation, redness and itching to the treated area, brittle bones (akin to osteoporosis), sexual side effects, and incontinence—or more commonly, the inability to control your bladder. Cool. So, in addition to carrying around a shit bag for six months after surgery, I get to wear an adult diaper, just in case I wet myself in public. Does the cost of treatment include a full-time nanny and an endless supply of baby wipes, too?If you’re still reading at this point, perhaps you’re thinking what I am thinking: there has to be another way. There has to be a better way. The answer is, yes, there is. Most of us blindly accept what a doctor recommends for treatment because that’s what society conditions us to do. But the truth is, the only person that will advocate for your health is you. Remember: Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine said, “first, do no harm.” When did our healthcare system abandon this truth? Can we make a stand and return to it? I believe we can. Thus, I am seeking a type of treatment—a way to heal the cancer—that doesn’t do the rest of my body (and the rest of my life) seemingly irreparable harm. I’ve become inspired by the books, Chris Beat Cancer , by Chris Wark, and Anti-Cancer, A New Way of Life , by David Servan-Schreiber, MD, PhD—both which promote nutrition as the true way to combat cancer. Both promote the use of juicing and raw food diets to aid in the healing process. Inside, one finds a wealth of knowledge on not only how to fight cancer naturally if you’ve been diagnosed, but also how to prevent cancer from ever occurring. I’m not naive enough to think that food alone will heal me. But, since my diagnosis I have drastically changed my diet to a raw food, whole plant based diet with A LOT of fresh-pressed vegetable juice, and in less than a month, I’ve already seen improvement. My tumor is shrinking. How do I know this? Because my tumor prolapses during a BM and I can see it. A part of the mass turned black then shriveled away. Doctors confirmed this was a positive thing. And now you know more about me than you (or I) ever wanted you to know. The conclusion? I am doing something right. But I need more. And I need help. Other therapies that exist are practiced under the guise of natural, holistic, or alternative medicines in the United States, and thus the stigma alongside them is one of disregard. But in places like Finland, Greece, and Germany—who has the highest cure-rate of colon cancer in the EU— these therapies are commonplace and even preferred. Therapies include treatments like IV-vitamin A, IV-vitamin C, IV-mistletoe, IV-curcumin, far-infrared light therapy—which uses heat to kill cancer cells, hyperbolic oxygen chamber, Rolfing—a form of soft tissue massage to help with bodily alignment, acupuncture, mind-body therapy, and many, many others. The problem is these treatments are not covered by insurance because they are not accepted as “medically necessary.” But for someone in my situation who believes there is a safer, healthier alternative to healing cancer, they are my only hope for long-term survival. Our bodies were never meant to be poisoned.During the past six weeks of my life, I’ve been called stupid, and was told that I am dying by members of my family that disagree with my choices. I’ve been blatantly told that if I do not listen to what doctors recommend, then I do not have their support. At times, I’ve never felt more alone. So, I am leaning on God for guidance to a safer way to heal. Through answered prayers, I was lead to the books Chris Beat Cancer and Anti-Cancer, A New Way of Life. And it is through these books that I have hope for a better way. Now, I am leaning on God once again as I urgently seek help from the public to fund my treatments. Its never easy to ask for money, especially because I am asking for help with medical bills that have accrued since my diagnosis—when I was uninsured—and that will continue to accrue, no matter what treatment I undergo. Thanks to the generosity of my parents, I now have insurance, but due to the circumstances of my health crisis, I am still unemployed. And until this battle is behind me, that is unlikely to change. The brutal reality is that, no matter what, I need medical help immediately. I’m just hoping for the least invasive, least harmful therapy possible. And with help from God and from you, I believe I can and will find a way to it.Please help me find and fund a better way for treatment before this cancer spreads. Donate a dollar.

If you haven’t experienced this please read on with as much understanding as possible. My dad took himself to the clinic in Tahoe City after a work luncheon for struggle of general cognitive function. Simple spelling and clarity of thought. My mom then transferred him to Renown Medical Center in Reno for further evaluation. His admission was hurried, and within minutes of receiving a CT scan the doctors were talking about a large mass on the left side of his brain. It got worse. They took more scans where they discovered a 10cm tumor on his kidney, which was the cause of the tumor in his brain. Additional legions were also found on his lungs, along with two more in his brain. The official diagnosis is called Renal Cell Carcinoma. He was then transferred to the oncology wing of Renown. Doctor after doctor coming through  the night, and hours to follow establishing next steps. A plan to get my dad the University of California San Fransisco to be admitted Monday January 21 2019 in preparation for brain surgery on Wednesday. I do not know what will occur in San Fransisco or much to the extent of his procedure. If all goes according to plan the recovery will last 2-4 weeks and then immediately begin immune cell therapy. There is also the opportunity for him to receive a trial treatment for his body to start fighting the tumors. The place of his treatment is still undecided and unknown, and I will provide as many updates as possible as we go forward.On Friday January 18th, 2019 about 7:30p my dad started his fight against cancer. And today I ask for your help in this fight. Medical bills will begin to pile up quickly for my family. Travel and living expenses for my mom to remain by his side in San Fransisco are already upon us. This means my family’s ability to generate secondary income is gone.We need prayer first, as God is the only thing that can heal my dad at this point. This cancer is currently incurable. Second, we desperately need financial support. Anything you can do to help will go a long way to take burdens and stress away from situation that has no time for it.We greatly appreciate anything you would consider contributing to this fund to help my dad, Peter Strand, fight for his life. A pleading and proud son,Matt Strand",73b716367e97a9e38c24e3b49c3a2a83,26,0.8216,5.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Before being admitted, he had lost his voice and had visible lumps on his throat. He went under several chemotherapy sessions and after several mistrials, he did a bone marrow transplant on June 1st. Two weeks later, he developed an infection which caused him to have trouble breathing. He went under bipap for three days which didn't help because he wasn't getting enough oxygen to his brain. Before intubation, fluids were taken out from around his heart due to pneumonia. This led the doctors with no choice but to intubate him for three weeks. During intubation, he was taking lasix to help empty the excess fluid in his body which continued even after getting extubated.  After being extubated, he began his road to recovery which consisted of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. He was in remission and was discharged from the hospital on August 22nd. After being discharged, he had a series of clinic visits every week which consisted of IV fluids and a multitude of medication. Five months later, he relapsed.This has now brought us to seek monetary donations towards paying for this second round of cancer treatments that is so badly needed.

We thought it was hand-foot-and-mouth for awhile then thought it was herpes then they thought it was mycoplasma or mono for a while we were going back and forth to doctors every other day and the fevers would just persist. He also had major back pain and low belly pain and it would just come and go and the doctors were attributing that to the joint pain that mono can cause. Finally  Wednesday Jan 16th he had one of his attacks in the Dr office and she witnessed it and said I think we need to evaluate further but pretty sure that it's a viral infection. When we got to the hospital the hospitalist just said I want to consult Hematology Oncology Department and they got an abdominal ultrasound which then required a CAT scan which showed that he had multiple multiple something inside of his body, they didn't call it a tumor at that point. Yesterday Thursday Jan 17th we had a lung thoratensis, then they read that fluid and he had bone marrow biopsies. Both of them showed this type of cancer. Today he was supposed to just have a simple procedure to get his broviac line in but because the cancer has made his abdomen so large it's pushed up his lung tissue and he's no longer able to oxygenate on his own.Currently he is in the PICU intubated on the oscillator.  He is struggling to breath and fighting the vent. They have increased his sedation which seems to be helping.Now it's just time -- time to start chemotherapy and get those tumors shrunk so that they can let his lungs re expand and he can breathe on his own again. Evan will be spending the next 6-7 month in the hospital undergoing Chemotherapy to fight this cancer. We will be here every step of the way... He is a fighter and will kick this cancer.Thank you all so much for praying for our little man and we just believe that God is going to heal this make this go away soon.

I have known Alan for about 9 years, initially meeting him at a friends wedding and reconnecting when we moved back to the area. Alan is always the kind of person that would give you the shirt off his back. He is so generous with his time and his gifts, never saying no to a friend in need. Alan is always there when his friends need him. Now it’s our turn to be there for him. Alan’s Story:    About 8 years ago, I went to see a doctor about a mass near my armpit. It was small but a bit worrisome. My doctor told me that based on touch and feel it was a lipoma (a benign fatty tumor) and there was nothing to worry about. I read that lipomas can grow, although rare, so when mine started growing, I didn’t think much of it. Fast forward to this year and the mass is very uncomfortable, to the point where it presses on nerves and makes my arm go numb. I was advised to get a biopsy before removing the mass to ensure it’s benign and nothing more. I was feeling very confident about getting good results. However, 3 days later when the results came back, I was diagnosed with Lymphoma and was told there’s a 90% change I had stage 1A of a rare type of Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. More tests were run and again I was feeling confident that this was isolated to my armpit region since I’m showing no other signs anything feeling wrong. The results came back. The cancer cells spread to my spleen and a small sliver on my L3 spinal column. My diagnosis changed to stage 3 Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. The next step is to cut a portion of the mass near my armpit to get a 100% accurate read on the type of Hodgkin’s I have and insert an implantable port to get the chemo treatment into my body to distribute the treatment continuously. My chemo treatment will more than likely start in February and will go for 5 and a half months (6 rounds of chemotherapy and then radiation will begin to kill off what’s left. As of now, this is my story.Your contributions would go towards Alan’s medical bills. His insurance has a very high deductible of $5000 before anything is covered.

At this time, the cancer is inoperable, but she will begin treatment within the next few days at U of M hospital. Treatment will consist of both radiation and chemotherapy, some of which will begin right away in the hospital with the other stages beginning in the weeks to come. Tasha currently has stents in her chest to drain off the fluid from her heart and lungs. Those will remain until the build-up of the fluid stops.Tasha and hr husband, Glenn, just gave birth to their first baby (Ryder) in October. They live in the Saginaw area but have been at U of M in Ann Arbor for the last week undergoing testing and treatment. Glenn has already used up all of his available paid vacation time from work to be in the hospital supporting Tasha and taking care of Ryder. Since Glenn is unable to commute back and forth to work, and will be unable to do so for the foreseeable future, they no longer have a source of income.The money raised will go to help take care of the expenses related to Tasha's hospital stay and to take care of their living expenses.

Through her teaching, sacred offerings, friendship, support and love, Visudha has touched the lives of so many people around the world, and continues to do so. 


Just a few weeks ago, our beloved Visudha received some unexpected and challenging news. She learned that she has Stage 2 bladder cancer.Visudha says: ""Crazily, my life has been completely turned upside down and inside out. I am taking a bend in the road I was not at all expecting.  I was just doing what I do, and BAM, suddenly I was going  on a whole other path.  As a woman who has traveled the globe for the last decade supporting others in their journeys toward healing and consciousness, I suddenly and quite abruptly now find myself in dire need of support for my own journey - which at this time is about staying alive in this body. I find that this journey thus far has been both terrifying and uplifting, and has literally stretched me to the edges of my knowing, of my life, - it has humbled and brought me to my knees in ways I cannot verbally express.I'm an international teacher and I'm also an ordinary person - I have children, and grandchildren.  I love being a mother and grandmother.  I am also a sister, daughter, friend, and student of life.  I play with kiddos small and large; eat well, and love good food; I go hiking, kayaking, and traipse about in nature; I pray, make music and art, lead ritual and ceremonies; and right now, I'm healing cancer.  I've not been a health nut, but I have eaten organically and naturally for most of my adult life. I make good health choices and don't drink or smoke, I've never had a job in the chemical industry: all things that are often indicators of cancer growth.  Seems I rolled the wrong dice with genetics and environmental toxins. So here's what happened - in  November 2018, I was doing what I do - this time teaching and and dancing in Greece, as part of a greater European tour.  I began having some symptoms that led me to medical care which revealed tumor growth. In December 2018, I had the tumors taken out. They were diagnosed to be Stage 2 Transitional Cell Cancer of the Bladder, which I call, and invite you to call, ""Creative Cell Growth"".  This is when things started to be a little surreal. Because of complications,  I was in and out of the hospital with a second surgery, blood transfusions, and a staph infection.   I realized from this challenging start that I needed to re-frame and take charge of my experience.  Step by step, I found myself reluctantly needing to cancel all of my upcoming workshops for most of the next year (yes I was booked that far out in advance),  and land back in Taos, New Mexico, creating a home base for the first time in many years, as I had been living out of a suitcase traveling to my many and myriad and beloved communities offering my workshops and retreats. These cancellations of course are a huge hit, as this is my sole financial support, but even more so, it is also a large part of my soul support.  It gives me such life force to witness the growth and transformation you have experienced, and that  I have been privileged to guide and bear witness too. I have learned from past life experiences that there is always a gift from difficult situations which has allowed me to enter this territory a bit more gracefully, and little less kicking and fighting my way through it.  In many ways, I am taking this as an invitation to come closer to my body and to spirit.  I'm taking this journey as a way to deepen my trust into life, its support, and its dynamic natural force. It's a culling, an initiation, and invitation. It's a way for me to transcend even more into the light and a deeper wisdom.  I trust when I re-emerge that I will have even more to share when I get back on my traveling, teaching circuit.""Visudha's doctors have advised her that the allopathic (traditional Western) approach to curing this is a course of chemotherapy, which Visudha has reframed as ""Chrysopoeia Elixir,"" followed by surgery. This approach is mostly financed through Visudha's insurance. The treatment plan which Visudha must undergo in order to heal is:          Chrysopoeia Elixir Phase: This is scheduled for 12 weeks, once a week, and has begun already. It includes travel to Santa Fe, and some possible overnights.         Surgery Phase: The surgery is highly intense and invasive, which will likely include some possible complications. Visudha's bladder will be removed, along with part of her internal reproductive system.  Hopefully, the bladder will be replaced with a neo-bladder made from Visudha's intestines.  There are other alternatives as well, but this is the method that will allow Visudha to engage with life most closely to the way she has been.       Recovery phase:  This will take many months to first heal Visudha's body, and then retrain it. Visudha is supplementing the allopathic approach with integrative approaches  (which fall outside of the purview of Western medicine, and are not covered by insurance).

My husband Ismail Hassan is a loving father of 5 children and a devoted husband. He is known to the community as a compassionate influential leader, who is recognized for being an incredible teacher, adviser, and mentor.After a visit to the dentist for what was assumed to be a toothache in 2015, my husband was diagnosed with cancer - and our family has never been the same.It spread from his gums all the way through his right jaw. He was immediately offered surgery which required removal of his teeth, a neck dissection, lymph node removal and transfer, including the removal and reconstruction of his jaw with bone taken from his leg. The surgery was successful with no complications, but the road to recovery was long and hard. My husband had a nasal feed, difficulty breathing, difficulty walking and could not speak. Fortunately because my husband was someone in good health before all this, he was able to recuperate at home after spending a month in the hospital and slowly regained some of his independence.  Unfortunately, the cancer wasn’t done with him. At the end of 2016 he was re-diagnosed and the cancer returned to the same area. We prayed once more and prepared ourselves for surgery.  He had another reconstruction, this time using a part of his femur from his other leg for a further reconstructive surgery in his jaw. Although there was a slight complication, and a 22 hour surgery,  the surgery was a success and we went down the long road of recovery once more. Anyone whose loved one is battling cancer is more than aware that it takes a strong toll on the family and leaves the mark of emotional pain and severe anxiety. Unfortunately, in August 2017 he was re-diagnosed again for the third time with another local recurrence. This time surgery was not an option so we got ready for radiation treatment. This was done back to back one month apart and the impact on his quality of life was so poor nothing could prepare us. I could hardly recognize my husband after the radiation. My husband Ismail had no saliva production, difficulty eating, was unable to talk and was suffering from absolute discomfort and fatigue. Currently, we have been informed this is an aggressive local tumor. Our biggest fear now is that the tumor will spread down to his lungs. I love my husband and I am his main caretaker, everyday I wake up with prayers and hope for the best. I want to be able to see my best friend by my side laughing with me and for us to grow old together, something I fear, cancer has stolen from me. After 2 failed operations, we decided we need to look elsewhere and began research on naturopathic cancer treatment options. After much research and consultation, we came across CHIPSA hospital, located in Arizona and New Mexico. The treatment offered here has restored hope in us that we may be able to beat cancer. The astronomical cost needed for this treatment is $120,000. Because of the amount needed for treatment, we soon realized that for this to become a reality we would need help from the community. The money raised here will go directly to my husband’s account to pay for his cancer treatment.This is his last chance, after 2 failed operations and a returning aggressive cancer we have run out of options and choices.We are willing to give it one last shot and I hope all that read this can be apart of saving my husband’s life.",cb0d14dfe800dff9d8fd88007bb8bbad,28,0.077975,8.0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Unfortunately she can't see well enough to do so. In a very short 5-week period she went from normal and healthy teenager to a kid fighting a serious brain tumor. It started as double vision which we thought was her eyesight since she had astigmatism. We figured she needed to update her prescription and visited the optometrist.Within a few weeks It escalated from from vision issues, to occasional headaches, then some mild dizziness. Eventually she had such bad headaches and we started taking her to the doctor. First to urgent care, then to the ER, then to her physician and finally to the ER again. In her final visit to the ER they suspected meningitis. The tests were negative and fortunately the Doctor ordered an MRI. The MRI revealed a tumor attached to her brain stem. This prompted an immediate transfer to Rady Children's Hospital where further evaluation and additional scans revealed it to be cancerous. Any funds raised will be used to cover medical bills and ultimately the clinical trials and experimental treatments that will be needed to fight this. At this point her current treatment will be a combination chemotherapies and immunotherapy which will be supported by cancer fighting dietary changes. Treatments range from $17k to $32k per treatment. We have been advised that it will cost around $350k for one year of therapy and drugs. You can keep up with her latest progress on her Facebook page. **Currently..... The daily annoyance of double vision is solved by covering one of her eyes.You can keep up with her latest progress on her Facebook page.Kira is an avid surfer and after turning 16 she has been excited to get her drivers license.

One day he drove down from work and went to the hospital to get a check up on the weird pain/feeling in his chest. What came next was the worst news we could have ever gotten, my father had a tumor in his esophagus/stomach and after testing that tumor it came back as a malignant tumor. My father was told by the doctors that he had STAGE 4 esophageal cancer and 4-5 metastasis on his liver. The recommended medical treatment duration is anywhere from 1-2 yrs. My father is a loving husband, father, grandfather, uncle, and brother to a very loving and supporting family he will be the first person to give you the shirt off his back or the shoes off his feet. He is known for working so hard for his family and loved ones, he has always put someone else before himself. He is only 53 yrs old and has much more to live, medical treatment is insanely expensive and deteriorating to his person due to chemotherapy and radiations my father is unrecognizable to himself and us. With the support of his family, friends, and local fundraisers we have been able to keep afloat for almost 10 months now but due to medical expenses and unforeseen circumstances we are asking for help. Due to this disease my father has unfortunately lost his ability to work or be the main breadwinner in the family. We have already accumulated a medical debt of around $113,000 in medical bills and medicine, even with insurance it is still incredibly expensive. We have sold many of our belongings to come up with the little money that we can and with the support of family members, we have been able to make it one day at a time until now. We are at our wits end and are hoping that we can get the sufficient funds needed to continue beating cancer and one day getting my father back on his feet to the hard working man that he is, that’s all he’s ever known. We still have a long road ahead of us fighting the hardest battle we have ever known. With the support of our family, our friends, and our loved ones we are hoping to finally beat cancer and put an end to this miserable disease.

Cancer won and battle but our love will win the war for this young family. Karun was blessed with  2 sweet kids, daughter (Gauri Batra, 8 years), son (Shoreya Batra, 4 years) and wife (Meenakshi Batra) . Karun, a doting father carved out a niche to make sure that he provided the best life for his kids in his best capacity. He was happily living with his family till Jan, 2018 when they came to know that Karun was diagnosed with a very rare, very aggressive, and very advanced (stage 4) form of blood cancer. Despite the financial hardships ,   Karun’s family didn’t lose hope and admitted him to best hospital of the city hoping he will get cured. The fighter Karun was, he fought with blood cancer for a year. After the initial chemotherapy sessions, doctors recommended Bone Marrow transplant, lot of tests & samples were done and Karun’s brave 8 year old daughter matched the bone marrow and came forward to save her father's life to donate her bone marrow.The cancer was very aggressive &  during the Bone Marrow transplant Karun developed a clot in the brain Karun went into coma.  Doctors put him on a ventilator, but he started sinking.  This Go Fund Me page is set up to  help offset the astronomical medical costs and to help out this young family in educating the kids and living expenses.   We are optimistic &  have set the  goal to $50,000 USD, if we exceed the goal, we will donate the funds to cancer research and patients who need funds for treatment.

Also, to stay up to date on Corey’s treatment, you can visit his Caring Bridge page:  https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/coreycrushescancer Corey Richardson was recently diagnosed with Stage II diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). To say Corey and Lisa are shocked is an understatement. Following the happy birth of Wyatt in October, they have been adjusting to their new life as a family of five with sisters Zoey and Nya, and this diagnosis has blindsided them. This particular type of cancer is usually diagnosed in people over the age of 60. Anyone who knows Corey knows he is extremely active and healthy, but cancer has never been known to discriminate. So now they are on the journey to crush this cancer and never let it come back!Corey had a PET scan the day before Thanksgiving that showed one small tumor in his neck and another medium (fist-sized) tumor in between his lungs. Surgery is not an option with this type of lymphoma. He started chemotherapy treatments the week after Thanksgiving, and will receive treatments every 21 days for the next 3-4 months. Corey had a few days of nausea and fatigue following the first round, but his energy is back up (at least as much as it can be with two toddlers and a newborn in the house!). He has been able to get in a few walks/hikes/workouts, which the doctor said will be an important part of his recovery. Corey and Lisa really like and trust their oncologist in Helena, but will be traveling to Seattle in a few weeks to meet with a team of lymphoma experts to ensure they are doing everything possible to crush this cancer on the first try. Corey has already reached his out-of-pocket maximum for insurance in 2018 and expects to reach the maximum in 2019 as well. The ongoing costs for treatment, travel, and other related expenses will quickly become a burden on the family.They are very grateful for their support network of family and friends. With a small donation, we can help relieve the financial stress of cancer and allow Corey to better focus on his treatment, recovery, and family.

I have metastatic breast cancer which is Terminal. I am looking for assistance in realizing my goals and desires while I still have a body capable of doing so.BACKSTORY:Young, confident, in-love and successful. I worked hard and built a great life by the time I was 30 with no intention of slowing down. I would soon find out that I didn’t have a choice.I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in December 2016. A persistent pain in my side eventually led to my diagnosis. It was aggressive, so I had to make the ""decision"" to move forward with the recommendation of doctors.  During my first Mastectomy they removed a baseball size lump from my right breast along with 28 Lymph nodes. I then endured Chemotherapy and radiation where I lost my hair and self-confidence, followed by DIEP flap surgery. In this surgery they removed my left breast also and made 2 new breasts from the fat of my stomach. The entire ""treatment"" process was incredibly painful and emotionally devastating. Never the less, I had this shit!! Calm, collected and tough, my glass was still half full. I continued to sell real estate through the entire ordeal and managed to not only finish as one of the top sales people in my office but took home the title of “Best Realtor of the South Coast” for the second year in a row. I was so lucky (and still am) to have the support of the best clients, colleagues, friends and family in the whole world!! I can’t help but sob as I write this thinking about my family and what they must go through just because they love me. FUCK CANCER!!!!! (Please forgive the language, my husband is a sailor after all.)June 2018 my life is finally starting to take shape again. My hair is grown out enough so that I can style it. My energy is returning, and I am feeling well enough to start going to the gym again. I am preparing for our trip to Jamaica in October to get married (something that was postponed by the cancer) and I am looking forward to a long future with the love of my life by my side.Have you ever been slapped REALLY hard right across the face? This is how I felt when I noticed the lumps in my left breast. Upon investigation, the lumps appeared to be dead tissue from the last surgery I had to correct the shape of my left breast. During the investigation however, new images discovered lesions on bones. From my femur, up through my spine and on my skull. THIS is not good news, this means I no longer get to work towards a cure or even remission. The name of the game now is to try and keep the cancer from spreading further for as long as possible. With that lovely reassurance, I sought medical treatment at Cancer Treatment Center of America in Tulsa, OK. Unfortunately, the prognosis was the same at CTCA. They did offer me oral chemo, which I take daily, and provide an incredible healing environment full of amazing people who really care. (If you or anyone you know has cancer, I would highly recommend making the phone call to CTCA immediately and seeing if there are options for you.) WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE ME NOW?You can find me some days trying to cure cancer. Researching and learning about nutrition and trying to change my lifestyle to reflect what I learn: Food as medicine, Rick Simpson Oil, Meditation, positive affirmations, energy healing, vitamins, self-care, sacred roots and special teas. Other days I go to doctor appointments, work, visit my mother, walk the dog, run errands and do chores. Most days I fight depression, battle with anxiety, struggle with body image, ache with pain and toile over the meaning of life and what my purpose is. I am on a roller coaster that I cannot control. My mental state is a surprise to me each day and my body is failing me.It is a very fine line to walk between being positive and realistic. And while I am going to give my best shot at curing my cancer, I also do not want it to be too late for me to experience some of the incredible things this life has to offer. The reality is that my bones are weak, my body is pained and I’m capable of doing less and less all the time. I want to stare in awe at the natural wonders of the planet. I want to grow internally as I learn new things about life from other cultures. I want to meet new people and show someone less fortunate that kindness and love can come from a stranger. I want to make memories with my family and friends that they will never forget. And lastly, I want to travel with my husband and have all the experiences together that we were supposed to have over our next 50 years of marriage.Thankfully my savings and the contributions of the community and my family have kept me afloat over the last 2 years. I have spent tens of thousands of dollars on medical care and travelling for care and I owe tens of thousands more with no end in sight. I have accepted a lot of truths about my situation, but I refuse to accept that I don’t deserve the life experiences I have worked so hard to realize. If I don’t get to do these things soon, I may never have the chance. Please help me by sharing this far and wide. Maybe a well-off person will see my list and want me to experience something that they have cherished in their lifetime.

Two things happened for the first time in my life. He cried, and he asked his son for a favor. To this day I can’t recall a single time he’s done either. His wife was to start radiation treatment the coming week, and he needed gas money to get to the hospital after work to be with her.  I couldn’t believe how bad things were. He’s never once let on that they were struggling. They made sure all the kids and grandkids had Christmas gifts this year, the whole time they were barely hanging on. This is how my parents are. Making sure their children and grandchildren are happy is and always has been their number one priority, even in the face of a battle with cancer running them dry. Now I knew for certain things were bad.  My mother, Lisa Adams, was diagnosed with a neuro-endocrine abdominal tumor in 2014.  Since that time she has been through ups and downs, but you wouldn’t have known it. She worked her butt off 60-70 hours a week at the hair salon to make ends meet. My father picked up a second job at the local bowling alley, for that little bit extra when she needed a break from her long weeks. They never let it become an excuse to give up or stop trying. Theyre putting my sister, Daisy Adams, through college at IU. She’s a 4.0 student and part of a sorority there. Paying her tuition, the whole time battling against their hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical bills compiling year by year. Trip after trip to Texas to see the best specialist in the country for her cancer. Thousands and thousands of dollars each time she got one of her painful injections. Month by month her medicines slowly helping less and less for her pain.  Well the dam has finally broken. Lisa’s cancer is now spreading to her spine and other various places. Radiation therapy is right around the corner. She’s now become fully unable to work. My sisters education is in jeopardy. With Dad spending most days bedside at the hospital, they have virtually no income. As a son, and a father to a beautiful baby girl of my own, I know it’s time to pick up the slack and kick this cancer’s ass.  For years they have fought this on their own and today I’m calling upon friends, family, brothers, sisters and the entire community to come together and help my parents beat my mothers cancer. They can’t do it alone anymore and they are struggling to make car payments, mortgage payments, tuition payments, etc.  Anything and everything is appreciated, and will go so far in helping them with the stress of money during a time when her wellbeing is so much more important. Please feel free to reach out to me if you would like to make any efforts outside of a monetary donation. Knowing the community is there and just knowing you don’t have to do it on your own can be a healing power in itself!￼￼￼￼￼",b0ec08ec8a8594ad96ab5416bac0598c,34,0.9,8.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

We live in Toronto, with my partner, Ravi, our youngest daughter, Uma, and my mother-in-law, Sudha. Tara is 18 and was taking a gap year to travel before starting university in Sept 2019. We had spent just over 6 months planning her trip which would have taken her to New Zealand, Thailand, Bali and Vietnam. She was working as a swim instructor and lifeguard and saving as much as she could to finance the trip. In late November, she got a travel vaccine shot and a week later became very ill. A number of blood tests kept coming back abnormal over the next few weeks, but no one knew why she was ill or what was happening with the blood work. Finally, a few days before she was to fly in January, she had a chest x-ray that showed a large mass. The trip has been called off, for now. Since then, we have been told it is a type of lymphoma - yet to be determined what type, but it is looking right now like Hodgkins. Regardless of the type, it is treatable, but it's going to be a long process. Most likely, it will be a full 6 months before she is well again. She will receive chemotherapy, and possibly radiation. Next week she is scheduled for a core biopsy, and after that we will know more about the treatment details. Because there is a fertility risk, she will be meeting to discuss egg harvesting and freezing before treatment. She wants to have children some day, and this will keep that possibility open. We are super fortunate to live in a place where most of the costs for treatment and for the fertility program are covered by public health care. There is also some private insurance, if needed. However, there are some things that are not covered and we are a low-income artist household. We would greatly appreciate any help that can be given. Funds raised will first go directly to the costs of medicines and tests that are not covered by insurance. Then to related costs, such as travel to and from the hospital, as well as to purchase things that will help Tara be more comfortable while receiving treatment; a wig and hats, as there will likely be hair loss, and a protective mask to prevent illness as her immune system will be weakened, acupuncture and massage treatments, possibly... a puppy (we are aware that a puppy will be more work for us, but it will also give Tara something to focus on besides being ill, and will also bring comfort). Finally, money will be set aside to cover the fees for keeping her eggs frozen until she is ready to have kids, and IVF.  If anything remains beyond that, it will go towards Tara's trip or university. She is most likely going to defer her placement in university for another year so that she can have some time to heal and then do the trip that she was supposed to be on right now. Please help if you are able. Even a small donation can be put towards some of these things and we are so thankful for any help!",732f7c2110597368665a5800922df5c0,26,0.936,7.0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

After reviewing the specifics of Tim’s particular case, Hope For Cancer approved him for immediate treatment at their Cancun location. His Hope For Cancer healing is expected to take between 9 and 12 months and includes three trips to Mexico for tests and treatment. Tim and Amy are extremely optimistic that after 2019, he will be able to triumphantly return to life 100% healthy and cancer-free.The down side to this amazing news is the cost. Unfortunately, Tim’s Hope For Cancer healing is estimated to cost upwards of $52,000 for treatment alone.  This does not include travel to and from the clinic three times, lodging, meals, as well as taxes and fees on the retirement account he liquidated to begin paying for treatment.  Additional funds will be lost as Tim and his (self-employed) wife, Amy, will have to take significant time off from their jobs during this process. This treatment, although very expensive, is very successful.  It’s the option that will save Tim’s life...and it’s worth the sacrifice that this family has chosen.  Chemotherapy and radiation is a painful and toxic option that will bring on additional repercussions and does not offer the survival rate that Hope for Cancer can offer.The doctors want Tim to start as soon as possible, so the impact on this family on so many levels from financial to emotional to spiritual has been overwhelming and humbling.  With YOUR help, the financial burden, which would overwhelm anyone, may not cover costs entirely but will certainly alleviate a great deal of the stress from this difficult yet absolutely correct decision to LIVE.Tim dreams of a long life spending time with his beautiful family: his wife, Amy, daughters, Ashlie and Shelby and sons-in-law, Joe and Matt. He hopes to meet his future grandchildren and shower them with love for many years. He looks forward to countless summers camping and riding dirt bikes with the Great Lakes Dual Sport club and teaching motorcycle safely at Motown Harley-Davidson.The other day, Tim came across a quote that read, “I haven’t come this far to only come this far.” He feels this sums up his feelings perfectly.

Giseli graduated Hunter College with Honors, Alexis is an entrepreneur and owns his own business, Agueda is talented beyond measure and can create anything and everything, Luis is a musical artist, Yesenia is a successful Manager, and Albis is one of the best cooks you'll ever encounter. It's hard not to think about what life what of been like if she didn't work day in and day out to provide a better tomorrow for us. She is the glue that holds the family together and having her in our lives means everything to every single one of us.On August 2004 we received devastating news. After going in for her yearly tests followed by medical procedures, blood draws and CT/MRI scans. Images revealed that there was a mass in her right kidney. The mass was unoperable and doctors shared that her entire right kidney needed to be removed. With Gods grace the operation was succesful, she has lived 12 years with only her left kidney and no health issues at all. Until now. On August 28, 2016 they found a mass in her only kidney. The left side. We were very fortunate to hear that this time it was operable and so the doctors removed the mass alongside a chunk of the kidney. A year later on June 14th 2017, we received a call that my mother was running errands and all of a sudden collapsed and lost consciousness. She was immediately taken into the E.R. Where doctors asked a million questions and suggested it might have been dehydration but to rule out all probabilities they wanted to conduct some tests and ensure everything was ok. After several CT and MRI's they shared news that changed our lives forever. There was two masses on her brain that metastasized from her kidney. One in the frontal lobe and the other in the back of the right side of the brain. Further studies also indicated that there is a mass in her thyroid gland and in her left kidney. We don't ask why because we believe that everything happens for a reason, even if we don't understand it. We just knew that this woman, our mother Elsa Garcia was going to live to FIGHT every single day from that day forward. It isn't easy to accept the harsh reality that we need financial help. My Brothers and sisters and I humbly ask that you make a donation to help my mother with her treatments. Every dollar helps. We have decided to do both conventional and Holistic medicine. Believe it or not we live in a world where not all treatments are covered and we need to ensure that she is receiving the best possible treatment. The funding will help cover treatments that are not covered by her health insurance, doctors visits, and transportation. We are beyond grateful to our family and friends who are praying for us, and who are standing alongside our path this journey. We believe that God doesn't give you Cancer so we will not allow our mother to be taken if it is not her time. Thank you for helping us fight this monster alongside of us. We will never be able to adequately thank you all for all the love and support. We are beyond blessed and don't take anything for granted. We love you all with all of our hearts ♥️ Unleash your positive energy. You give life to what you give Energy to.

Después de ir para sus pruebas anuales. Después de muchos exámenes médicos, de sangre y de CT / MRI, las imágenes revelaron que había una masa en su riñón derecho. La masa era inoperable y los médicos compartieron que todo su riñón derecho necesitaba ser removido. Con la gracia de Dios la operación fue exitosa, ella ha vivido 12 años con su riñón izquierdo y sin problemas de salud en absoluto.Hasta ahora.El 28 de agosto de 2016 encontraron una masa en su único riñón. El lado izquierdo. Fuimos muy afortunados de saber que esta vez fue operable y en poquito tiempo los médicos la operaron y eliminaron la masa junto a un pedazo de riñón. Un año más tarde, el 14 de junio de 2017, recibimos una llamada que mi madre estaba haciendo recados y de repente se derrumbó y perdió la conciencia. Ella fue inmediatamente llevado a la E.RDonde los médicos hicieron un millón de preguntas y sugirieron que podría haber sido la deshidratación, pero para descartar todas las probabilidades que querían llevar a cabo algunas pruebas y asegurarse de que todo estaba bien. Después de varios TC y MRI compartieron noticias que cambiaron nuestras vidas para siempre. Habían dos masas en su cerebro que metástasis de su riñón. Uno en el lóbulo frontal y el otro en la parte posterior del lado derecho del cerebro. Otros estudios también indicaron que hay una masa en su glándula tiroides y en su riñón izquierdo otra ves.No nos preguntamos por qué, porque creemos que todo sucede por una razón, incluso si no lo entendemos. Sólo sabíamos que esta mujer, nuestra madre Elsa García iba a vivir para LUCHAR cada día a partir de ese día. No es fácil aceptar la dura realidad de que necesitamos ayuda financiera. Mis hermanos y hermanas humildemente les pedimos que hagan una donación para ayudar a mi madre con sus tratamientos. Cada dólar ayuda. Hemos decidido hacer la medicina convencional y holística. Lo creas o no, vivimos en un mundo donde no todos los tratamientos están cubiertos y debemos asegurarnos de que está recibiendo el mejor tratamiento posible.

Soon she will have her 3rd surgery and begin chemo treatment.   To help with her medical expenses and the other financial tolls this devastating news will take on their beautiful family of 5 my husband and I are starting this GoFundMe account.  The money will go straight to the family’s account to help afford Medical expenses for baby Ellie. Sam and Kristina are the type that always put others before themselves and we hope that with all your help we can help support them during this stressful time.Ellie’s Story told by her Mommy ❤️Today is a good day though last week has been a complete blur for Sam, Ellie, and I. It all started with an unexpected visit to our pediatrician last Thursday afternoon. To then rushing to DHMC ER and that is where the story begins. Thursday night after being in the MRI we found out that our baby girl has a very large brain tumor with lots of swelling and they had her in the OR preparing for surgery to remove it. After what seemed like days we finally got news early Friday morning that she was out of surgery and she was stable. The surgeon informed us he was not able to remove it all, only about 75% as it was getting too risky so he stopped. Friday was the start of a very excruciating waiting game. The sample was sent out for pathology and we were told it could be up to 10 days before we knew what we were dealing with. Fortunately we only had to wait til Monday. Monday we were delivered the worst news possible, our baby girl has brain cancer. And to make matters even worse we were told that it is an extremely rare type and the most aggressive kind of cancer. The surgeons goal at this point was to go back in and remove as much of the tumor as possible and he truly hoped he could remove it all. The location of the tumor and the way it was attached had the surgeon deeply concerned. He wanted to be able to remove it all to give the next step a higher chance for success but also knew it was in an extremely risky location. Tuesday finally arrived and she was taken away for surgery and at this point we stopped breathing. It was a very long 9 hours til we got to see our baby girl again but it came with great news. The surgeon was able to successfully remove the rest of her tumor, and we could breathe again. Wednesday is here and now we play the waiting game again. We wait to find out from oncology her exact cancer type and how they are going to try attacking it.

Him and His Family Need Our Help. On October 11th, 2018 Jamie was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. He was admitted to hospital that same day to start immune system booster treatments for his chemotherapy treatment which started Oct. 15th. After commencing the ‘Dana Farber Protocol’, a planned 4-Phase, two and half year chemotherapy program which included radiation treatment on the central nervous system, Jamie started to develop rashes and swelling to his lymph nodes in the 9th week. On January 16th, 2019 it was confirmed that Jamie’s Cancer had returned!Jamie is now in the Saskatoon Royal University Hospital preparing to undergo a new chemotherapy mix aimed to drive the cancer into remission and enable him to undergo a stem cell infusion. Jamie’s parents have been selected as his nearest match, at 50%, and will be the donors for this infusion. Jamie has been told finding a 100% match will be difficult given his rare stem cell type. All of Jamie’s family and friends are working hard to raise awareness of the importance of becoming a stem cell donor in support of Jamie and all those who find themselves undergoing these same battles of trying to find a perfect match.

He cares more about others and their happiness than anyone will ever understand. He’s the biggest NASCAR nut around, but  you would never have guessed it by looking at him. He has a crazy husky who he adores more than humans, and family and friends that would do anything in their power for him.  He loves photography and exploring and traveling anywhere that he can manage to get to. Alex has a love for cars and a very dedicated presence in the car community with his organization, Dub Empire. On August 2013 Alex was diagnosed with a rare pediatric bone cancer called Ewing’s Sarcoma, that was discovered in his right ankle. Shortly after finding out the diagnosis we learned that it had already spread to his lungs. Alex started intensive chemotherapy and radiation to his chest and right ankle on September of 2013- April 2014, completing 7 rounds. June 2015, Alex had a procedure, known as a wedge dissection, following more chemo and radiation. This was to remove the cancer in a small portion of the left lung while saving the remaining healthy lung areas.  After the treatments and procedures were complete, Alex’s scans came back clear. He was cancer free! The scans continued to be clear for roughly 2 years. August of 2017, the scan showed 3 small nodules were back in the left lung. With the support from family, Alex decided he wanted to try to do a clinical trial up in Virginia at the National Institute of Health. The trial that he was doing had success and the tumors were shrinking, but in January the scans were different. The tumors showed growth. They were no longer responding to the trial. While back home in Orlando one night, Alex ended up coughing up blood clots.  We immediately decided it was best to go to the emergency room. That is when he found out that the tumor was growing so much that it was causing a tear in the lung. Alex had a procedure done to patch the tear and stop the bleeding.Shortly after the repair procedure he tried a second trial back up in Virginia at NIH, but quickly it put his liver at dangerous levels. The medical team was concerned it would lead to liver failure. It was abruptly put to an end. Upon returning to Orlando we met with the Oncology team at UF Cancer Center in Orlando, where Alex was previously being treated. At that time the team decided it would be best to remove the tumor altogether. Unfortunately, due to the size of the tumor that meant removing the whole left lung. May of 2018, Alex underwent a left pneumectomy removing the lung and tumor.August of 2018, Alex had his follow up scans to make sure everything was clear after the surgery he underwent. There once again was a spot. A small amount was missed and it had begun to grow. Immediately once again he decided he wanted to undergo traditional inpatient chemotherapy.  Four cycles have been completed since then, but at the recommendation of the Oncologist at UF Cancer Center Orlando; Alex will soon be seeking a second opinion for further treatments. Alex is having difficulty working at this time.  The treatments have left him weak and in a lot of pain.   Despite all he is going through, he remains as upbeat as possible. Watching him go through this with such dignity is hard for his family members. He is a proud individual, so asking for assistance is hard for him, but the bills are piling up and he needs all of the support he can get.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼",caefead396613260bdd2c2d262605b45,38,0.3825,5.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

He is also one of the kindest, most intelligent, charming and delightful people you could ever hope to meet. He is beloved by his many friends and students for his contagious enthusiasm and love of painting as well as his dedication to his students’ individual artistic development. Last year he was diagnosed with a stage 4 high-risk, aggressive form of prostate cancer. There were no warning signs, so as those of you who have been through this type of ordeal will understand, our world was flipped upside down. His prostate surgery was followed by two more surgeries to address complications, three blood transfusions and 3 weeks in intensive care. Once this ordeal was over, the healing process began for Patrick but the cancer reasserted itself in mid July. Things turned worrisome again. In September, he was placed on a new cancer protocol, in fact he was the first cancer patient at the Kimmel Cancer Center to be on this innovative therapy. By November he was responding positively, but the treatment has serious side-effects: soreness, limb pain, and the worst side-effect of all, chronic fatigue.
The good news is that he continues to respond positively to the therapies and medications. The cancer cells remain inactive; the downside is that the soreness, limb pain and the chronic fatigue intensified. It has limited Patrick’s time to teach and lecture. His painting, his lifetime passion, has also been limited. The loss of income over the past year, along with the growing medical bills not covered by insurance, has made it necessary for us to ask for help. Patrick works as much as possible, exercises regularly and intensely to combat the fatigue, and never loses faith he can continue to fight. We have 18 months more of treatment, including radiation, and I have no doubt that Patrick will carry on with the same grace and enthusiasm that is his nature. The slogan we have adopted at our house is to be “cautiously optimistic and aggressively positive.” The outpouring of love and support from our families, friends, and neighbors and, of course, from his Cancer Team at Kimmel Cancer Center, has been an enormous blessing. While it is stressful and difficult to ask for financial help, we find ourselves falling behind. Every little bit helps. Please donate.

Aimee has recently been diagnosed with brain cancer. About 7 years ago Aimee had Melanoma(skin cancer) on her left shoulder. It was just a funny looking mole that turned out to be cancer! She went and had it removed and she was told that they got it all and that the margins were clear. After 5 or so years, with continuous check-ups, they told her she was good......cancer free!  Many of you know Aimee from Buffalo Wild Wings were she works. On November 10th Aimee suffered a seizure in the kitchen at work. She split her head open and was taken to the hospital where she got 18 staples in her head. That day In the ER we thought we were just waiting for the results of a routine CAT scan to say every thing was ok so she could go home. That's not what happened. Instead a doctor came in and told her that she had brain cancer and that there were 3 large tumors and numerous lesions on her brain. If you know Aimee you know she is special. She is truly the best, most loving, giving and caring person you will ever meet.  She is always doing something to make someone else happy, even strangers. She always says she's just paying it forward. Cancer really sucks and since this nightmare started in November Aimee hasn't been able to work at all and we're not really sure when she will be able to go back to work. What sucks too is that cancer is expensive! One drug she needs costs $10,000+ and another costs $9000+ she has good insurance(thanks BWW) but a lot of things just aren't covered and things that are are only partially covered and its adding up fast. We are doing this GO FUND ME to help Aimee in her fight so she can pay for her treatments and the medicines she needs and so that she can focus on KICKING CANCERS ASS and not have to stress and worry about the bills that keep coming in.

Sometimes ignorance is bliss as we did not know at the time just how devastating ovarian cancer actually is. Celeste had lost two friends to this deadly disease but didn't know just how scary the diagnosis was because just the word cancer in itself is such a traumatic diagnosis. One is never prepared for it especially when no one in her immediate family had ever had ovarian cancer to her knowledge. In a recemt book called ""Memoir of a Debulked Woman: Enduring Ovarian Cancer,"" the author, Susan Gubar writies, ""There are many forms of cancer that offer a lot of hope but not this one.""  And further she goes on to say that there were 21,550 new cases of ovarian cancer in the US in 2009 and there were an additional 14,600 women who died from it. [In the UK, 6,500 women are diagnosed with the disease every year, and 4,400 die each year]. It used to be estimated that one out of 70 American women would get the disease, the deadliest of all gynaecological cancers, though recently the number sometimes cited is one in 55. There are very few published personal accounts for them to consult, since for decades, indeed for centuries, women have generally maintained silence about the silent killer.""  Like the author above, Celeste underwent surgery which in her case was an 8 hour surgery, which included  blood transfusions.  She then completed 6 rounds of chemotherapy which we know is a controversial and extremely toxic course of therapy that last 10 hours each time it was administered. Because there is so little hope offered by mainstream medicine, Celeste has diligently explored supportive treatments from the alternative medical community which we both believe is a must for everyone to do.  Although Celeste has good insurance there is so much that is not covered and that includes a very special therapy that is at this time to be considered state of the art (more about this in a moment) and therefore I am asking for your help financially to help us pay the cost of this treatments since insurance won't. It is our hope for Celeste that she can beat the horrendous odds she is up against with ovarian cancer, which reocurrs more often than not as she wants so very much to get back to what she loves doing best and that is helping other people in any way she can.If you need to refresh your memory who Celeste is, you may remember her as a talented actress, who co-starred with Elvis Presley in the film ""Live a Little Love a Little."" Many people also remember Celeste for having been the last elected Miss Rheingold back in 1964 where she garnered 20,000,000 votes to be the spokesperson for an Eastern Seabord Brewery called Rheingold. It was an advertising legend that the Mad Men of the day dreamed up to sell beer and Celeste was the 25th Miss Rheingold. Many notable actresses got there start with this contest  but you may need to ask your grandparents about it if they lived in the  area.Besides have been being a model, spokesperson and actress and has been a part of 'show business' all her life Celeste is a devoted mother and grandmother who has spent her life in the service of others, through her work as a Holistic animal advocate and author.   Below are the covers of her two latest books for pets which she co-authors with her writing partner and dear friend Jean Hofve DVM.Most recently Celeste was one of the producers on a documentary film entitled, ""Femme Women Healing the World,"" where she also appears with 100 women from around the world as a spokesperson.  She loves empowering women and sharing the importance of gender equality, through her speaking, writing, producing and personal appearances . Celeste was so excited to be part of ""Femme,"" because it gave her the opportunity to share the importance of partnership with ones gender of choice, to help our world move forward to peace at last.  She was very excited about the future and wanted and still hopes to continue to be a part of conscious film making. However, on that fateful day, November 21, 2014 our world and plans were shattered as she faced all that would be in store for her for the forseeable future  right before the Thanksgiving holiday. Celeste had gone to her gynocologist for a pretty routine visit to discuss what she thought were some symptoms that seemed minor and couldn't believe what was to follow after being so healthy and after being devoted to holistic health care and wellness all her life. Bravely, she was steadfast and underwent that emergency surgery. We were blessed that Celeste had this amazing and excellent surgeon and surgical team to  operate on her.  It was like a miracle that one of the best women's cancer surgeons was available at our local hospital.On November 25th, I waited for nearly 10 hours with Celeste's daughter and son- in- law to finally get the good news that the surgery was a success but far more complicated than expected. Her surgeon removed 10 pounds of cancerous fluid from her peritoneal area,  along with performing two bowel resections and a complete hysterectory.  He debulked the peritoneum as well getting rid of all the cancerous tumors.After 4 grueling weeks in the hospital along and enduring a huge dose of antibiotics for an infection at the surgery site,  living with all the drains and tubes and minor additional surgeries, she was finally released in time for Christmas with the family and me. Our prayers had come true, our beloved Celeste was able to open presents with the family by the beautiful tree her daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter had decorated . She went through all this like a champ and is grateful to be alive and have the support of  her loving friends, fans and family.  The chemotherapy with all the side effects that come with it followed the surgery and this was rough on Celeste however with the help of  holistic modalities which she does each day as she needed to build up her strength and her immune system.  We didn't realize how chemo demolshes the cancer patients immune system rendering the person vulnerable to every germ out there. Because we didn 't know how serious this could be, Celeste didn't want to miss out on speaking at her favorite conference and thus sje made an appearance at the Conscious Life Expo in February 2015 the LAX Hilston. Because her immune system, unbeknownst to us was so weak she caught a horrific flu bug, which went into bronchitis and she landed back in the hospital. We now know all to well that when you go through chemo it truly wipes out your white blood cell count and with this bug she had become what is called neutropoenic. Celeste needed to be put in isolation at the hopsital and all the nurses were masked, gowned and gloved when they entered her room. Her coughing was so severe she got a very large hernia internally below her new surgical incision. This is called an incisional hernia. Like all hospital stays Celeste expressed that she was getting worse being there but was finally released to continue healing at home but still had to complete the rest of her chemo rounds for a total of 6. And chemo just makes everything take forever to heal. Celeste bravely faced the struggle to move forward and together she and I went into full on survival mode. 


Celeste completed all 6 rounds of those grueling rounds of chemo however Celeste she need to face another surgery on July 24th 2015.  Her PET and CAT scans  thankfully did not show any evidence of cancer however it detected two blood clots (DVTs) which required placement surgically of an IVC filter in her Vena Cava vein to prevent the migration of the clots during surgery when she would not be able to have her daily very painful Lovinox blood thinning injections which is pretty routine now during hospital stays and also for DVTs. Celeste had this repair surgery which also revealed what is called a lymphocyst the size of cantaloup, this was removed by a wonderful surgeon, then a second amazing surgeon stepped into repair her huge incisional hernia using polypropylene mesh to repair it and then a third surgeon stepped into to close and repair the damage that all this had done to her abdomen. Keep in mind this was a secon opening for the very same incision that was done in November for the first cancer surgery.Celeste's first surgeon being a man of vision who does not simply accept the standard of care,  had the foresight the night before that first surgery to ask if we could come up with a very large sum of money to store the tumor tissue at a facility called storemytumor.com as he would  be removing that tissue for future use and we, having no idea how we would come up with that money  simply said yes to what the universe might have in store for Celeste.This tumor storage was prepared and banked for later use for a special personalize medical protocol at a facility off shore in the Grand Cayman Islands called PerseusPCI . You may have seen lately in the news perhaps on 60 Minutes some of the exciting things that are being done in personalized cancer therapy and then of course the treatment former President Jimmy Carter had.  This new personalized immuno-therapy involves a series of 4 injections which have been  made for Celeste from this stored tumor tissue and her own blood.  Celeste and I traveled to the Cayman's this past December 2015 to make her vaccines and receive the first in the series which are done intradermally..just under the skin on top of each thigh. Upon arrival they review your blood work, give you a Nupagen shot to boost your white count and then go to work in their state of the art FDA lab to make the series of special vaccines only for Celeste. There are no other ingredients like you hear about being used in traditional vaccines. Here only ones own biological material is used and this is unique to PerseusPCI's patented delivery sustem.  Again insurance doesn't cover any of these costs and it is a cost that must be incurred. The percentage of people surviving past 5 years who just do chemo and surgery are only about 2% and this new treatment option is our hope in extending Celeste's life expectancy.  Here is a bit more information for your perusal in case you or a loved one would like to also explore this option:What is a cancer vaccine and personal cancer immune therapy? ""A cancer vaccine is designed to awaken the immune system and activate it to fight the cancer from within. The patient’s own tumor is used to vaccinate the patient making each vaccine personalized. These treatments are experimental, extend the patient’s time in remission, and have relatively no side effects."" The cost of this treatment alone has eaten up all that has been raised by the fund thus far as prepayment is required at the onset of treatment and we must travel back and forth to the Caymen's every 30 to 45 days for a total of the first four vaccines and then there will be two boosters at 3 month and 6 months. See  http://www.perseusPCI.com for more on the treatment protocol Celeste is doing presently for immunotherapy in the Cayman's.Of course,  Celeste is utilizing all the holistic and alternative options you would expect someone with her knowledge to do such with advanced neutraceuticals, CBD Rich Hemp Oil, Moxxor Omega 3, special arromatherapyl oils and an advanced cancer protocol with state of the art supplements, but as most of you know insurance doesn't cover any of these protocols and treatment options.Here is a bit more about Celeste's career""Live Long and Prosper!Celeste, besides co-starring with Elvis was also in many other films and TV shows but she is still well known for having been on the original Star Trek series in the classic episode entitled, ""The Apple."" Celeste has bravely trekked through the taxing medical reality of ovarian cancer treament, healed from the 6 rounds of chemo,  survived the stress of the extreme costs of her care,  much of it, as I mentioned is not covered by her insurance.  Celeste wants very much to see everyone again at autograph and media shows in the future and we have even made a trip to Germany together this past March for a wonderful Elvis event in Bayreuth Germany. We also were able thankfully to attend the STARCON/STICCON convention in Bellaria Italy to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Star Trek with none other than Bill Shartner, Captain Kirk himself. Her professional travels thankfully included all expenses being paid for us to attend.Celeste's  writing career as many of you know has been devoted to the service of people and animals,  and supporting causes to make this world a better place. This she does through her work in television, film, books, speaking engagements and all things wellness and anti-aging, for which she has been a tireless advocate all her life. Being struck by this thunderbolt in Celeste's 70th year has been huge and has led to major upheavals within our lives. Any financial support, even of $5 at this time is very much appreciated and tremendously beneficial in aiding her recovery, helping her get these amazing treatments in the Grand Cayman Islands where just the travel costs itself are astronomical is so very needed as she wants very much to continue to be of value to others. We send our love and thanks to all who can help her at this critical time. Please share this site with others as the symptoms of  the hard to detect ovarian cancer are listed here in several of her updates.  Celeste wants all women to be vigilent and not neglect any symptoms that seem suspicious. Ovarian cancer is very sneaky and standard diagnostics don't catch it soon enough. Celeste works tirelessly at her Facebook group page called Holistic Cancer Care and you may request to join and feel free to share it with others. Celeste hopes to do a book for women on Holistic Cancer Care and share what has worked so well for her thus far to get her into remission. Do keep in mind that we can't ever say that cancer is cured but we can say there is no evidence of disease and the purpose of immunotherapy is to prevent reaccurences. Celeste needs to build up her strength as she had a set back with an infection and was hospitalized again over the 2015 Christmas holiday however she  recovered beautifully but a chronic condition of bone on bone degenerative hip disease was exacerbated to such a degree we must now explore hip replacements for her as walking and standing have become so painful and difficult for her.In 2017 Celeste experienced a recurrence which they caught early and needed a second series of 6 rounds of chemo, this time with Doxil and the Carboplatin again. CBD Rich Hemp Oil helped her to not take the drugs for nausea and pain however insurance doesn't pay for this and it is several hundred per month.Celeste completed the 6 rounds over 6 months from spring of 2017 to November on the Carboplatin and Doxil and all looked great. CA125 was normal, CT scan looked good but the following month, December, 2017 everything started to look like another recurrence was taking place as the CA125 starting going up and up. Celeste received in January 2018 and again in April her two and final immunotherapy boosters from PerseusPCI which did not work at all this time as we got the devastating news on the May CT scan that the ovarian cancer came back again in the peritoneum but also hit a lot of lymph nodes and spread to her lungs, and two other places. They still even though the cancer moves to other places still call it ovarian cancer. Celeste's oncologist put her on a new drug called a PARP Inhibitor (Lynparaza) for 3 months at the beginning of 2018 and this too did not work as her CA125 started to soar and this was not good and very scary. So she was put on a daily low dose chemo pill which she takes each night and then we go into Cedars every two weeks for an IV infusion called Avastin which is an anti-angiogenesis drug meaning it targets the vessels that help to feed cancer! The CA125 came down after 4 weeks and has dropped since then but no where near the normal range but at least so far it has not gone up but Celeste developed a horrendous cough in May of 2018 with bronchial and diaphramatic spasms that after 4 months of various holistic and  allopathicmedical treatments have not made it to go away...no infection, just the nasty cancer making it feel like she needs to cough something up and there is phlegm but the cough just won't stop. She has seen many doctors both traditional such as a wonderful new integrative physician, a naturopath who supports the Western medical options and side effects with holistic things and a new fantastic pulmonologist...however, so far nothing has helped and she is very worn down and worn out and also short of breath. But she and I both remain positive and optimistic that something will work soon and she will be feeling well again. For now...we do the best we can!  Celeste and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your love, compassion, prayers and support...we couldn't have gotten this far without each and everyone of you and we do consider this fund to be an answer to a prayer to simply stay alive and live another day.Please share this page with others of course because we so need your help but also because we hope that what we share here will help others, too.Most Gratefully,NazimPlease visit Celeste's business website as she loves  to pay the things that she has found to be helpful forward. http://www.artofwellness.bemergroup.com",b4045d3335d160297db31f4d59363252,86,0.9724545454545455,1440.0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0003190810465858328,0.0,0.5962328767123287,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

Although this was a huge life change, the initial prognosis was great, and she was told that thanks to advanced research in the field, most patients who take these daily oral treatments live a relatively normal life. A year has now passed and my sister has been unable to tolerate the TKI treatments due to a haematological intolerance, regardless of multiple dose changes and reductions.  She has been told that she will now need to have a Bone Marrow transplant in order to survive. The Bone Marrow transplant will require high-dose Chemotherapy and radiation in order to kill her existing bone marrow in preparation for the transplant. The procedure will see her in the hospital for approximately 4-8 weeks, and she will need 3-12 months of recovery time to be back to her normal self.There are many risks associated with this procedure, including a high risk of Infection from low immune system, and rejection of the transplant. She will also no longer be able to have children, and will need to preserve her fertility. She has been lucky enough to locate a donor match for this procedure, and is beginning consultations and transplant classes next week to prepare for this life-changing procedure.  My sister is incredibly talented, funny, loving and the kindest woman you will meet.

Yo la conozco. He visto su increíble perseverancia al buscar trabajo, su pasión casi obstinada para aprender inglés (créanme, no hablaba una sola palabra) y la descomunal energía que tiene para lavar platos hasta altas horas de la madrugada, sabiendo que en pocas horas debe levantarse de nuevo a estudiar. Mari es fuerte, pero para enfrentar este reto necesita un poco de ayuda. Un pequeño empujón, no es más. Los médicos acaban de diagnosticarla con “carcinoma papilar de tiroides”, y según el dictamen está en Categoría VI, lo que quiere decir que tiene alto grado de malignidad y el procedimiento a seguir de acuerdo con los médicos, sería la remoción quirúrgica.Así es, estamos luchando contra el tiempo.Mari debe someterse a una cirugía llamada TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY + CENTRAL NECK DISSECTION lo antes posible, pues en este punto de la historia cada minuto, literalmente, es vital.Nunca, en ningún momento de nuestro viaje a Australia, esperamos vernos enfrentados a un reto como este (venimos a pasarlo bien ¿no?). Pero los problemas llegan y hay que ponerles el pecho; claro está, hacerlo es mucho más fácil si contamos con apoyo.Maricel dice todo el tiempo que su mayor preocupación es estar sola en este país, y necesitamos la ayuda de todos ustedes para demostrarle que no es así; que aunque su mamá está lejos, en Australia tiene una familia inmensa que está dispuesta a hacer lo que sea necesario para salvarle la vida. Hemos creado este fondo para ayudarle a costear los gastos de su tratamiento; pues aunque afortunadamente el seguro médico cubre el valor de la cirugía, Mari no puede volver a trabajar durante los próximos dos meses, lo que implica que no tendrá dinero para cubrir los gastos durante su proceso de recuperación (consultas médicas, medicinas, vivienda y alimentación).Básicamente queremos quitarle a Mari la preocupación de no tener trabajo en Australia (todos sabemos lo que significa eso), durante sus dos meses de convalecencia. ¡Queremos que se concentre en recuperarse!Si además del apoyo económico, tienes alguna otra forma de ayudarnos a que Mari supere esta dura prueba, te estaremos eternamente agradecidos.-----Mari’s story began just like anyone else who has come to this country, facing her fears and taking on new challenges to grow as a person. Nevertheless, Australia has been tougher on Mari than on most of us, and today she is facing what is perhaps the biggest challenge that anyone could ever face on this journey: a fight against cancer. But Mari is strong! I know her. I’ve seen her incredible determination at finding a job, her dogged passion to learn English (believe me, she couldn’t speak a word when she arrived) and the colossal energy she’s got for washing plates until even the wee hours of the morning, knowing that in just a few hours she would have to get up all over again to study. Mary is strong, but to face this challenge she needs a bit of help. Just a leg up, nothing more. Doctors have recently diagnosed her with papillary thyroid carcinoma, classified at stage 6, meaning it has a high degree of malignancy and that doctors have recommended surgical removal. Indeed, we are in a race against time. Mari must undergo an operation known as TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY + CENTRAL NECK DISSECTION as soon as possible. This late in the game, every minute, literally, is vital. Never, at any moment of our journey in Australia, do we ever expect to find ourselves staring down such a challenge (we’ve all come to have fun, right?). But problems pop up, and we have to give them all we’ve got. If anything’s clear, it’s that doing that is a lot easier when we have people to fall back on. Maricel always says that her biggest worry is being alone in this country, and we need the support of each and every one of you to show her that this isn’t the case; that although she may be far from home, in Australia she has a family that is willing to do whatever it takes to save her life. We have created this fund to help cover the costs of her treatment, since although her medical insurance fortunately covers the cost of the surgery, Mari will be unable to return to work for the following two months, meaning she will lack the money needed to cover her costs during the recovery process (medical appointments, medications, rent and food). Basically, we want to free Mari from the stress of not having a job in Australia (we all know what that’s like) during her two months of recuperation. We want her to focus on getting better! If, beyond just financial support, you have any other way to help Mari along through this difficult test, we will be eternally grateful.",33118ec40abf957bff83f172c0b2974c,27,0.4385,7.0,4,0,0,1,0,1,0,0.0011299435028248588,0.0,0.5732647814910026,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

She truly loves veterinary medicine and the pets she works with. About 2 weeks ago, Meg's beloved greyhound George began limping. Fearing the worst, she immediately took him in and he was subsequently diagnosed with osteosarcoma (bone cancer) of his right forelimb.  Gold standard of treatment is amputation of the affected limb followed by chemotherapy. Unfortunately, this typically is associated with a $2000-3000 bill, which no vet student can actually afford, especially considering the debt:pay ratio we are left with upon graduation (she is hoping to get an internship after graduation, which averages about $25,000/year). The amazing doctors and staff at the UGA Veterinary Teaching Hospital did everything they could to get George into a study, meaning his bills would be covered.

He will be in the hospital for five days and nights every three weeks for a total of three cycles. Because the chemo treatment is so harsh, he needs to be on fluids 24/7 for the 5 days of infusions.   The good news is that with the chemo treatments, the doctors are hoping for a cure!Going through cancer treatment is very costly.  The average cost is $50K or more. Unfortunately, Brendan’s medical insurance does NOT cover cancer treatment.  He had obtained a new insurance last year, and cancer coverage would not begin until April of 2019. It did not even cross the Martin’s mind that Brendan would need any medical coverage for cancer!  They are doing all they can to try to get some financial aid help, but because their income level is not at the “poverty” level, financial aid is hard to come by.The medical bills have already started piling up for the Martin family.  Go Fund Me is a positive means to help alleviate those bills, so that they can concentrate on Brendan fighting this horrible disease and not on finances.  If you would be so kind as to donate anything, I know it would be very helpful and meaningful to the Martins.

A fearsome force with both speed and a powerful shot, Timo was feared by many of his opposing players not only for his incredible pace on the pitch but also his crunching tackles. In 2004 Timo lead the OUA in scoring as a rookie and was named OUA Rookie of the year. He was also named to the OUA All-Star team and took the Carleton Men’s Soccer MVP award that year. Following the conclusion of his playing career, Timo remained active in the Raven’s community helping to coach the next generation of Raven’s soccer stars. Through the Junior Raven’s soccer program, he shared his passion for the game and brought the joy of Raven’s soccer to boys and girls from across the city. Timo is now fighting brain cancer and the Carleton Men’s Soccer Alumni Association is raising funds to help offset the costs of his recovery. Timo underwent surgery on Tuesday, January 15th to remove the tumor and is now recovering at home with his family. Let’s come together as a soccer community to help Timo in his road to recovery.

He has fought hard and has been full of faith every step of the way. He has gleaned strength from God, his family and his community. Always doing his best to have a great attitude. He has been so courageous and brave. Taking each twist and turn of this journey, with prayer and faith. Missy said it best when she said “He will be home around 4 tomorrow for good and I have the greatest honor of serving him until he sees Jesus. Thank you for being there for us through the good times and bad, for cheering us on, for making us laugh, for all the prayers. This thing we call life is so precious. And we are just going to be spreading joy and celebrating Harrison and his amazing life.” And those words are the truest ever written. Right from his mommas heart! Like Missy said, as of this afternoon, Harrison will be at home, with hospice care making him comfortable here on out. Because of that, Missy will be taking an unpaid leave to care for, and spend time with Harrison. As a community, our job is to rally around the Pluta's - to love and serve them however we know how to.  Sometimes, in situations like this, we have no idea what to do, how to help, how to love, and how to serve. There isn't an outline for how to do things like this. But the Word says that we are blessed to be a blessing. That it is far better to give than to receive. that as Christians and people who want to love, our job is to carry each others burdens. (Galatians 6:2) As Harrison, and the Pluta’s community, we wanted to create an easy outlet for you to do that. Because of the accumulating medical bills, unforeseen expenses, and Missy taking an unpaid leave from work to be Harrison’s primary care giver, one of the many and most practical ways we can lift a burden from the Pluta’s is a financial gift. The Pluta’s thank you. Our community thank's you. And I know God is grinning as He watches His people come together to love the son, and family that He loves so much. Let’s love the heck out of them!",e0f72cbcf3ce5de4fbf767e5a89fe9c6,26,1.1915,150.0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

A few months after marriage in September, we found out Cathy was pregnant! 

Starting in July and August, I started having symptoms of constipation, where I would only be able to go #2 every 3-4 days. The pain would build up and last 24-36 hours of extreme pain before I was able to have a bowel movement.  Initially, we both thought it was because we recently got married and were eating out so much with all of our family and friends that have been in town. These episodes of constipation would occur every 2-3 weeks and they felt like they were getting worst even with our change to a healthier diet.Just 2 weeks after we found out we were expecting our first child, I went to see a Gastrointestinal doctor. He put me on a bunch of fiber and it didn't help at all with the constipation. The following week he scheduled me for a colonoscopy where they found a 2 inch tumor in my sigmoid colon.  We were told to cancel our honeymoon plans because treatment would need to start right away.Within just a few days of being given the diagnosis of colon cancer, I was getting CAT scans and PET scans which would confirm that I was Stage 4. They did tell me, that although I was Stage 4 because the tumor had broken through the wall of my colon, it had not spread to any of my other major organs (they just saw some spotting within my abdominal wall).By the time November rolled around, I already had a port-a-cath placed and was getting my first rounds of chemotherapy (Avastin + Oxaliplatin + 5-fu). The doctors had me on a treatment plan to come in every 2 weeks for chemotherapy infusion for about 3-4 hours and then I would wear a pump home that would administer additional chemotherapy over 2 days and then I would come back in to be disconnected from the pump. During this time, Cathy  and I were between doctors appointments (either for her prenatal check-ups or my chemotherapy treatments). Throughout her pregnancy, Cathy  drove me to every single doctors appointments, every scan, and sat by me during every chemo treatment. During her entire pregnancy, I went through 12 rounds of chemo. Emma was born 2 weeks after my final treatment.  The doctors had given me a 5 week break from my last/12th round of chemo so I could spend precious time with Emma.On July 2nd, I went in for my colon resection and to also have the HIPEC procedure done. I was in the hospital for 2 1/2 weeks and was told that surgery went well. They removed a large portion of my colon where the large tumor was, some spots on my small intestine and some spots within my abdominal wall. The surgeons told me that not only did they removed all visible signs of cancer, but the HIPEC should ""clean up"" any left over cancer that may have been missed. They also removed 50 lymph nodes to be sent to pathology and miraculously was told that NONE of them had any evidence of cancer. We thought we were in the clear!Since being discharged on July 17th, I have been following up with my surgeon on a bi-weekly basis. He reassured me that around the 3 month mark is when patients generally start feeling like they're back to normal. While each day my surgical pain was getting better and better (I was using less and less pain meds before stopping altogether), I noticed my meals and ability to eat were getting smaller and smaller.The 3-month mark came and went and I got to a point where I was, again, completely unable to take anything in without it coming right back up and causing immense pain in my stomach/intestines.Now, here we are today. I have been in the hospital for 2 weeks now. For a week and half, despite numerous scans, x-rays and attempts at an endoscopic procedure, doctors were unable to see any blockage/obstruction that would cause my vomiting. They did see a pocket of fluid and performed a paracentesis to have the fluid analyzed. The results just came back a few days ago and we were given the devastating news that they found malignant cancer cells within that fluid. My surgeon said that although they don't see a tumor on any of the scans, the presence of those cells is indicative of the tumor growing somewhere and that it is most likely the cause of my inability to eat. He said surgery is not an option because of 1) the fact that I have quite a bit of scar tissue from my first surgery, 2) he's not sure he would even be able to cut it all out, 3) he's not sure that my body could handle surgery at this point and also 4) that surgery would delay any sort of chemotherapy treatment (if that were an option). I was told to follow up with my oncologist to see if he has a plan of attack. My surgeon has said that it will definitely not be the same chemotherapy I was given in the past as it clearly didn't work. He also prepared us for the possibility that there might not be a treatment option as my cancer seemed to be resistant to treatment.Since my initial diagnosis on October 11th, 2017, I have lost about 50lbs, I have been poked with a needle more times that I can even count, I've spent nearly every week at a doctors appointment, I haven't been able to hold my baby girl since she was first born due to the pain and just my general weakness from the weight loss and inability to eat. I am currently living off a TPN and can't take in anything orally without vomiting.I started my own business 3 years ago and my wife and I both work from home. Since all of this, the time we've been able to work has slowly declined to now stopping altogether. Cathy spends the days here with me at the hospital and then rushes home to be with Emma at night. All of our savings has gone towards medical treatments and we've had to start putting things on credit cards. We are currently in the negative and have no idea what other medical expenses may lie ahead.Our Goal with this Go Fund Me campaign is to help pay for our current medical debt, upcoming medical bills with the new year and provide financial support for our family during this difficult time so we can concentrate on spending as much time as we can together without worrying about our medical bills that are piling up.In addition, we hope each and everyone shares our story to as many people as we can in hopes of a miracle treatment we are not aware of. Thank you for taking the time to read our story.",d003e71659bc0a4aebae267b8c33c305,40,1.2945333333333333,60.0,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

This was discovered after he was admitted into ICU at St. Catherine's Hospital on 11/5/18  due to being incoherent and confused. ￼￼￼It turned out he had an Intracranial brain hemorrhage from one of the tumors that we didn't know existed. After multiple scans of his body the doctors told us that he has two large tumors and a cluster of 5 smaller ones surrounding each large mass. They are too deep in the brain to be able to operate on. The prognosis is not very good with the number and location of these tumors.￼￼￼Both are on the left side of his brain. After one large tumor hemorrhaged  he became symptomatic. Now his speech, memory and mobility have been affected. He is  unable to leave his bed without assistance. On November 16th my dad started his first radiation treatment at Good Samaritans Hospital in West Islip and completed it on November 26th. We hope that the radiation will shrink the masses so that he can regain partial function. He is due to go back to our radiation doctor on February 7th 2019. They will do new tests to see how his body responded.

Unfortunately, 10 days before the scheduled surgery the mass ruptured and the cancer cells metastasized to her lungs. With complications due to the pleural effusion to her lungs (cancer spreading), surgery was no longer an option at this time, so Simone decided to take a few weeks to strengthen her immune system and begin to heal the cancer at a clinic in Tijuana Mexico, specializing in integrative treatments.

In February of 2012, I was first diagnosed with stage 3-breast cancer at age 25. The treatment I received shortly after that diagnosis was 8 rounds of chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, 33 radiation treatments, and 25 hyperbaric oxygen treatments (because I had a really hard time healing after all of the treatments I had already gone through). Days before my double mastectomy I got married to my husband Wesley. It was one of the best days of my life and I thank God for him daily. Then, in July of 2013, I had breast reconstruction surgery. I had a hard time healing after that and spent 5 days in the hospital on high dose antibiotic. I was on hormone suppression therapy for almost 4 years. I had really awful side effects from those and got off of them in July of 2015. At the time I was diagnosed, I was on active duty in the US Air Force and thankfully my insurance covered all of these treatments and medicines. I have since been medically retired from the Air Force. In May of 2014, I moved back to MI to be near family. On March 4, 2016, I found out I was 5 weeks pregnant. What a miracle it was because I was told it would be VERY difficult to have a baby after all of my cancer treatment. BUT, God knew how much I desired to be a mommy and he gave my husband and me that gift on Oct. 21, 2016 when our beautiful, healthy baby boy was born. I thank God for my son Jackson everyday who is now 10 months old. Since having Jackson I just haven't felt well. In just the last few months it got worse and I started getting a rash with bumps on my right breast/chest that never went away among other health problems. I went to the dermatologist at the beginning of August 2017 and they biopsied 2 spots and it came back positive for recurrence/metastatic breast cancer. In the last few weeks I've had many tests done (scans, blood work and a liver biopsy). It turns out that the breast cancer is stage 4 and has spread to my skin (in the area where my original tumor was and the skin around it on my chest), and to both of my lungs and liver. After weeks of prayer, research and discussions with my husband and doctors I have decided that I want to use alternative cancer treatments in addition to some conventional treatments to fight this second battle with breast cancer. The first time around I used mostly conventional treatments and it wiped out my immune system and I have experienced many health problems since. I want to fight cancer differently this time and have a better chance at having quality of life. With that being said my insurance will not cover anything that isn't standard of care and will not be covering any of the integrative/alternative treatments that I will be using. I will be having surgery Sept. 1, 2017 to have my implants removed (which have been an issue since day one in my body and have caused a lot of pain in discomfort in the last 4 years) and I will be having a hysterectomy (that has been recommended by doctors because my cancer is ER/PR+/HER-) and they want to put me in menopause so I will have a better chance at fighting this hormone positive breast cancer. Insurance should cover most of this but not all of it. If you feel led to donate to my healthcare fund please do.  If you are unable to, that's okay too. I'll happily accept your love through prayers. Your prayers and support are very much appreciated. If you want to know more please contact me via Facebook or e-mail and I will get back to you as soon as I can. God got me through cancer the first time 5 years ago and I know that He will guide me through it this time. I have my fears about my son Jackson growing up without a mommy but my faith is stronger than my fear. And I have to submit my life to God’s plans and His will. I will not let fear keep me from following God, for I know that he will always love me and never leave me. I knew this day could come and cancer “could” viciously return to reek havoc in my body again I just didn’t think it would be right now. However, it is my hope that God uses this trial to impact the lives of people around me. “The LORD is my light and my salvation— whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life— of whom shall I be afraid?” Psalm 27:1Thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart.Here are a few links to some videos that were made the first time that I battled cancer... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocz5NlreN5c&t=9s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tyxWCCK-uA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApP33GCrbcSpaceCoast Living Magazine Article:  http://spacecoastliving.com/survivor-a-call-for-camaraderie/",fc5fbefedefbc5e7dfc1ad38791e6284,40,0.77925,510.0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

She is JOYful, loving, kind, peaceful, gracious, warmhearted, optimistic, funny, intelligent, thoughtful, witty, a yogi, a teacher, a natural athlete, a musician, an adventure seeker, beautiful, world traveler, Aquarian, natural, emotional, empathetic, understanding, and even-tempered. She’s a dream daughter, a loving sister, a sweet niece, a cool aunt, a loyal partner, a ride or die friend, and the most amazing cousin a person could be blessed with.  I have spent many moments feeling intense gratitude to have her as a constant in my life, a built in best friend from the beginning, a sister without all the childhood arguing.  In a million years the words “35 year-old breast cancer patient” would not have entered my mind...Yet here we are.A few days before Christmas 2018 Kelly Joy Kaso was diagnosed with breast cancer.  At a routine GYN exam her doctor discovered a lump in her breast and Kelly was advised to have further testing immediately.  The tests began within a few days, first a sonogram, then a biopsy along with sonogram and mammogram.  Naturally the tension and anxiety grew while waiting for the results. Finally, on Friday 12/21, the last day of school before the Winter recess, the radiologist called to say that the biopsy test results were positive.  The news was devastating and shocking, incomprehensible.  Her best friend Lindsey and her mom were with her and as she spoke with the doctor, they listened and wrote down the information about what to do next.  After some time for hugs and tears, calls were made to schedule her appointments.This was the beginning of Kel’s Christmas break, a time that would usually be to rest and recharge for the next school semester.  Instead, during the next 2 weeks Kelly had genetic blood testing, met with 3 breast surgeons, 2 oncologists, a fertility specialist, had an MRI, another sonogram and a blood test.  Various cancer treatment plans, chemotherapy, radiation and surgical options were discussed.  Hundreds of questions and phone calls and conversations continue to take place.  The decisions that Kelly has to make are both complicated and mentally and physically challenging.  They will effect her for the rest of her life.  Trying to stay present and positive has been nearly impossible at times, but she is determined and resourceful.  She has so many loving friends and family to share this journey with, and with their help she is researching many areas of holistic healing to accompany the medical treatment she will be receiving.  Kelly has begun treatment with acupuncture, zero balancing, clean(er) eating and continued yoga, meditation and exercise.  She is an amazing spirit woman and she will be cured.At this time, plans for work logistics, medical leave options, and financial responsibilities are being considered.  There is still so much unknown that lies ahead, and the weight of it all is exhausting and overwhelming.  Seeing her go through this and knowing that after the fight she’ll be recovering in an accumulation of bills, I wanted to give everyone who wants to help an opportunity to do so.  Kelly has spent her whole life bringing JOY to those around her.  We can return the love and light that she has given others and make her burden a little lighter by donating any amount you can afford toward her medical bills.  Thank you so very much. Your support will offer her the peace of mind needed to focus all of her energy and thoughts on healing after her treatments and surgeries.  Let’s show her just how much the people she loves have her back and are fighting along her side!",f709c74df70974514a9065f410a5c1aa,28,0.08254,10.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

It receives less funding leaving children — and their families — desperate to find experimental treatments that insurance companies won’t pay for. DIPG is viewed as an orphan disease because it has not been adopted by the pharmaceutical industry due to little financial incentives for the private sector to make or market medications to treat it.The treatment for DIPG has not changed in more than 50 years. Astronaut Neil Armstrong lost his young daughter, Karen, to DIPG in 1962, protocols for treatment and life expectancy had not changed since that time.In February 2018, our 12 year old daughter Josephine was complaining of double-vision and began losing her balance. We brought her to the eye doctor who immediately sent us to the emergency room. That emergency trip to the hospital forever changed our lives as Josephine was quickly diagnosed with a brain cancerous tumor called DIPG that the doctors have determined is impacting her nervous system and it’s lethal. ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Since that fateful day in February, we have been visiting different doctors and hospitals desperately trying to find care that will help Josephine while we struggle to find a balance between treatment options and quality of life. We are praying that while she is fighting, a medical breakthrough will happen and Josephine will be able to quickly go back to being a normal 12 year old girl. But the cold reality of a brain tumor is weighing heavily on our hearts as our child has the fight of her life ahead of her.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼We had daily trips from New Jersey to New York City to hospital for appointments, treatments, physical therapy, MRIs, surgery, biopsies, medicine, and radiotherapy. We now have monthly trips to Monterrey, Mexico for intra arterial chemotherapy not available in the U.S. Taking pride in always being able to care for our children ourselves makes it very difficult to ask for help, but we are in a situation where every bit helps so we must ask. The monthly intra arterial chemotherapy costs not covered by insurance are beyond our means. As of June 1, 2018, promising treatments such as CART T cell therapy and TOCA 5 among other form of treatments are still work in progress…The new law “right to try” that just passed only addresses FDA approval of drugs not procedures….As of July 1, 2018, a genetically modified poliovirus therapy developed at Duke Cancer Institute shows no sign of clinical trials for DIPG pediatric tumors...In fact, study participants of prior trials were selected according to strict guidelines based on the size of their recurring tumor, and  its location in the brain.  A tumor by the pons is not a location they would even consider at this point....Monterrey, Mexico offers intra-­arterial chemotherapy which consists in delivering chemotherapy in a highly selective way, infusing the drugs directly on the arteries that feed the tumor. This procedures are supplemented later on with immunotherapy. The cost of these procedures ranges from $15,000 to $33,000 per infusion depending on the combination of the procedures. The number of treatments depends on every patient's response, but the frequency ranges between 8 to 12 treatments the first year. Josephine ‘s first intra arterial chemotherapy took place 8/13/18 and we are coming back every four weeks afterward.....we are currently spending $22,000 monthly in these treatments since August 2018. These expenses are adding up......Any contributions provided will go toward Josephine’s medical expenses and care. No amount is too small and it is greatly appreciated.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Thanks for your support in helping Josephine battle brain cancer.

For the past 15 years, I’ve been married to my college sweetheart, Shannon, while we’ve raised our 4 children (Isaac- 14, Grace- 12, Rush- 11, Micah 10).Although Shannon and I lived in a mobile home and qualified for welfare the first 5 years of our marriage…huffing and puffing to pay the monthly bills. All along, I had a secret dream of creating a thriving business that helped people live their life to the fullest.So in 2008, I went to the public library (because we couldn’t afford internet access or a computer), and launched an internet business with about $90 to my name.Much to my surprise, the business took off.I quickly dedicated myself completely and totally to coaching entrepreneurs how to start and thrive businesses themselves. And the message grew quickly, spreading to 10’s of thousands of clients from all over the world in just a few years.My amazing clients provided our family an equally amazing life. We have been able to journey the world, take great family vacations, and truly engage in the thrill of raising our children.But 4 years ago, something weird happened.Let me explain…While wrestling with one of my kids, something felt strange in my stomach and suddenly, I couldn’t breathe.I was raced to the E.R…I remember moving in and out of consciousness for several minutes. I nearly died on the stretcher.Once I was finally stabilized, my wife and I were in our own hospital room. And I remember lamenting to her, “Jeez, I hope I don’t have a kidney stone or something like that because I don’t have 3 days to waste on this stuff.”Sidebar: throughout my entire life, I rarely got sick. The flu would storm through our house and everyone, (even the dog! <—not kidding) would be puking. But I’d go around to everyone’s bed and give them a kiss goodnight. The kids had a little saying around the house: Dad doesn’t get sick. Period. But anyway, back to my wife and I***A Doctor came to our hospital room and said, “I’m not sure how to tell you this…but you have hundreds of tumors on your liver and a massive tumor on your pancreas. There are also some other suspicious spots too.”I was speechless, and mumbled the question, “You mean, I have cancer?”“More tests are required, but I’m afraid so…and it’s very advanced” he said gravely.It was like Mike Tyson in his prime gave me a full knockout punch.I felt dizzy. Disorientated. I thought about the kids. One of my dreams was to walk my daughter Grace down the aisle at her wedding and toast my sons at their graduations and so much more. I thought about my parents. Friends. I thought about my bride being alone with the kids. I thought of all the unfinished dream projects in my heart. I just felt like all the spirit was taken out of me.But it was the first day, we didn’t have much info yet, and I was still optimistic. I thought to myself, “People can live for decades with cancer nowadays.”Within a day or so the official diagnosis arrived, I had “neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer.” <—exactly what Steve Jobs had.There are fewer than 1000 cases of it per year, and 5-year survival rates are 1%.Determined to live fully, I asked my Harvard-trained doctor, who specialized in this rare form of cancer, “Okay, what do the 1% do to survive?”He replied, without batting an eye, “Those people were misdiagnosed. They never had what you have. No one lives with this disease. I’m sorry.”I was coldly given my 2-4 months to live.I had a small $500K life insurance policy (we had been meaning to increase the size of that policy for over 5 years but ‘life kept getting in the way I guess’). The Life Insurance quickly paid out what is a called an “accelerated death benefit” <—when a team of doctors determine there is 0% chance the patient will live beyond 6 months, some policies will pay the majority of the death benefit to help ease the family’s pain through the last few months. With that nice chunk of money, we went on a mission to heal me.We aggressively looked for a cure, doing traditional chemo, experimental “out of pocket” radiation treatments that cost upwards of $100K. Also, we traveled across the world to famous healers. We even took seed money to launch “KingsLife” Insurance brokerage to help prevent families from being caught unprepared like we were.Meanwhile, as my energy came and went…and came and went…and came and went…my ability to produce income dropped drastically.I had such little energy to give, everything in my life suffered. But we kept fighting. Month after month.We would visit the Doctor and they’d say, “Well, you probably have 2-4 months to live.” <—the last four years of Doctor’s visits feel like groundhogs day because they also repeat like a broken-record “you probably have 2-4 months to live…possibly less.”Nonetheless, we stay resilient. I’ve been in and out of hospice 3 times. My body keeps reviving itself. It wants to live. I can feel it. One time my hemoglobin count was down to 3 (average men my age are around 13-17) and they gave me 24 hours to live. But somehow I bounced out of that with a full body blood transfusion.But the scary rollercoaster continued, just a short while ago (on Nov. 26th 2017), I had a couple tumors in my back eat away a couple vertebra and I woke up paralyzed from the waist down. Upon waking up, they raced me to the E.R. for two emergency spine surgeries. The slicing and cutting through my spine and back muscles brought excruciating nerve pain I didn’t know was even possible. So as I type this, I’m learning how to walk again, put on shoes, shorts, and function.A chorus of Doctor’s have united again in sharing with me that it’s unlikely my body will be able to rebound from this surgery on top of my Stage 4 diagnosis…and again, that I probably have 2-4 months to live. They recommend hospice again.But…that’s where a group of my friends and clients enter the picture. They called me and said, “You’ve been able to beat this for 4 years, and you can keep doing it. We want to throw you the ultimate gofundme fundraiser!”This GoFundMe has two primary purposes:#1- To help alleviate constant rain of medical bills and expenses this disease brings.#2- To set up Shannon and the children so they can continue to advance the Hoverson Brands you created.Personally, for the last 4 years, I’ve been very resistant to asking anyone for any help. In many ways, I was ashamed to ask because I knew many years ago that we should have upped our life insurance to at least $5M…but my procrastination prevented it from getting done. And being known as a man who has a little bit of wisdom, the amount of folly in not making that a priority for my family has caused me great regret. But my mother’s wise advise was not to dwell on my mistakes, but rather take everything to God in prayer and trust <—Thank God for a Mother’s Wisdom!As I mention in the video above, it’s emasculating to not be able to provide for one’s family (at least that’s how I feel). However, I want to make sure that our family is taken care of and I want to show my children that even in this dark “valley of the shadow of death”, bright and brilliant hope still exists for our family and that anything is possible.Even breaking the Go Fund Me Record! <—which I can only thank our launch team of over 35 friends and clients for putting this vision in front of us!To finish, a dear friend called me earlier today and told me the real reason he is standing tall to champion this gofundme. He said, “Mark, you’ve been able to defy death over and over using the same strategies you teach others to overcome challenges in their life.”He moves on…“This movement is about believing that no matter what the circumstances you find yourself in: whether you are given a scary cancer diagnosis, or wake up unexpectedly paralyzed…there are ways to overcome everything and keep fighting through with will-power, prayer, community, and God.”My friend’s words stirred my soul. And I hope they resonate with yours too. Please consider making a donation of any size today. It means the world to me, my wife, and our children. Thank you.Mark and Shannon HoversonIsaac, Grace, Rush and Micah",79a76c5c6676c21ae50d100e65424c01,55,0.822508,360.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I haven’t really worked in 20 years. I have enjoyed that time raising my children and homeschooling them. Because we are self employed and my husband isn’t going to be able to work  things are really uncertain for us. We do not have medical or life insurance. I know God has a plan, But so far his plan has really not been very comforting. DIAGNOSISOn Jan. 15, 2019, my husband went to the doctor for what he thought was a stomach virus that wasn't getting better, we were given the devastating news that day that he had a tumor in his pancreas. They immediately admitted him and sent him off for surgery. He had to have a stint put in, the tumor was blocking his pancreatic and liver valves. The surgery was a success and he was immediately able to eat and drink for the first time in a week. A biopsy was done and they confirmed he has  Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Cancer.  From what they can tell, the cancer has not yet spread anywhere. We may have caught it very early. PROGNOSIS Loren is a (rare) candidate for surgery. The surgery must be done quickly (within a few weeks).  The tumor will continue to grow and will spread. We do not have medical insurance, we do not qualify for any state help and have yet to been able to find a ""charity"" to help with the astonishing medical bills we already have and the ones will have in the near future.  We found a surgeon who will work with us, but we need a massive down payment to even schedule it. If we can get this surgery, he will have a much higher survival rate, without the surgery, the prognosis is grim. WHAT WE NEED HELP WITHThis is the hard part, we need financial help. I am swallowing my pride and asking for assistance financially. We need to come up with money for this surgery. We need to help cover our bills while my husband is not working. I don't know what the future holds for us. PLEASE CONSIDER DONATING TO HELP OUR FAMILY.

It is difficult to keep everyone updated, so my hope with this is to provide an outlet where we can keep all of our family and friends up to date as this transpires. Phil has recently been diagnosed with a Glioma Tumor in his brain. He was experiencing symptoms that landed him in the ER, looking for answers. It was discovered that Phil needed to undergo brain surgery to remove the tumor that has been causing him so much distress. The surgery took place on Sunday, where surgeons near and far, worked diligently on Phil for over 5 hours. They successfully removed 98% of the tumor, leaving 2% behind due to medical reasons. Phil will also need to begin chemo and radiation in the next few weeks to assist with removing the remaining 2%.Phil is now in recovery and in good spirits. In fact, his humor didn’t take much of a break as he asked his Mom for a snickers upon coming out of anesthesia. Oh, Phillip! His journey is far from over, as he still has medical hurdles to overcome. Some that we just simply cannot get into at this time. However, his recovery time will be, at best, 6 months. We all love him and James very much, and want the best for them both. So I am reaching out to you all today to please continue to pray for Phil and James during this very scary time. We have set up this Go Fund Me page in hopes to raise money to help cover some of their expenses during this recovery time. My wish for them is to focus on each other and on Phil’s health, rather than worrying about bills. I will continue to update you all on how he is doing on this page. Again, I thank you all for your well wishes and prayers. You all mean so much to us.   xo",b91ebfdefd62a37784d1f90a2e8c35d2,24,0.3392,30.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

His purpose of travel was to get the best training for his profession as a body builder. Isaac is an established athlete who has been joining body building competitions internationally. He was invited to come to Canada by IFBB Prologue. He won a Silver Medal in Thailand for the World Body Building Championship in 2012, as well as a Silver Medal in the Brazil Worldwide Championship in 2014. In 2016, he got Gold medal at the World Championship in Kuwait, as well as the overall worldwide winner. He also become a member of IFBB Pro. Six months prior to their arrival to Canada, Issac started developing severe headaches. He sought out medical help in Iran and specialists ordered brain MRIs which came back as normal. Three different specialists in Iran confirmed that his issue was simply migraine attacks. They prescribed a basic headache medication and sent him away. Shortly after their arrival in Canada, Issac started having unbearable headaches. On November 24, he woke up with an excruciating headache, so painful that he couldn’t even see properly. He was brought to the NORTH YORK GENERAL HOISPITAL ER and found out through a CT scan that there was something unusual happening with his brain. This moment would flip his life upside down. He was transferred to St. Michael’s Hospital in Downtown Toronto where he was informed that he has an abscess in his brain which needs to be removed as soon as possible.They operated on his brain on November 25th. There, doctors found out that the mess in his brain is actually not an abscess or infection but a tumor. Everyone was shocked when a biopsy later confirmed that it is ADVANCED STAGE SARCOMA BONE CANCER that started from his skull. According to the neurosurgeon, the tumor on his brain got spared to the major vein, which takes the blood and oxygen to the brain. Later on, the oncologist found close to a dozen lesions on both his right and left hipbones which robbed him of his ability to walk on his own. He has been restricted to a wheelchair as there is a high risk of a hipbone fracture if he walks. The cancer has also spread to his pancreas as well as his liver. Isaac would visit the doctor frequently in Iran for standard medical check-ups as part of his profession, and not once was there any tumor detected by his doctors. Isaac who, two weeks ago was athletic, active and enjoyed running around and playing with his daughter has been bound to a wheelchair and told that his days are numbered. The cancer has taken over his entire body and is consuming him completely. Unfortunately, specialty hospitals in Canada requires him to deposit money before they take him in which costs $200,000 Canadian. Although; they purchased Travel Insurance in Iran unfortunately, the insurance company did not cover anything as they believe this was the preexisting condition even though all the medical reports from Iran indicates that Issac was completely healthy. In only a few weeks, the total money they have had to spend is $13,000 CAD just for the surgery fee and $1,800 just for the ER registration. This does not include the daily hospital room fees ($2000-$2500/day) and CT Scans ($1500 each session), medicines, and other exams done which already have amounted to $70,000. The surgeon informed them that they would need more than half a million Canadian dollars for the treatment of his cancer.There are no words to describe what this young family is going through. Issac is only 31 years old. His wife Niloufar, 27, is looking after him while their beautiful 2-year-old daughter is left with a relative who had to sign her up at a daycare, so confused about the things going on around her. They could have never even imagined that this happy vacation would suddenly take such a miserable turn.The family is desperately asking for help to raise funds for Issac’s medical treatment, tests, and examinations. He has to do chemotherapy and radiation as soon as possible and they need to raise the money to start his treatment. With the advanced condition of his disease, it is not advisable for him to go back to Iran. He also has a much better chance in Toronto’s medical facilities.This family is in need of so much help and we are asking everyone to please make a donation of any amount they can to make it possible for him to get treatment as soon as possible. Please help us make Issac treatment a possibility so he can be a father to his child and a part of his family’s life. Thank you so much.

I seemed to be in good health. In July, I hurt my back. My pain never went away, it just became increasingly worse, and I was worried. I had given up my health insurance because of the cost. Lesson to learn: no matter what, you MUST have health insurance!I finally went for an xray at the beginning of this month. After seeing something concerning,  the doc suggested I go see an oncologist. An MRI was done.  Bad news. 4th Stage Lung Cancer that metastasized to my spine and several lymph nodes.  A mass has grown 2 1/2 inches and fractured my vertebrae. Which, in turn, pinched the sciatic nerve. Hearing that I have 6 months to 1yr to live (without treatment) is a surreal thought to grasp. The pain was so intense I couldn't move for hours after waking up. But I love baseball, and working with the Astros so much that I would drag myself to every game. I kept this pain to myself because I didn't want my Astros family to be concerned about anything but winning another World Series. I also continued working the Texan games. I told the rodeo folks- My sweet friend Ida Nuncio and the big boss James Davidson because I knew I wouldn't be able to do any lifting. I finally told Rob Runnels at the Astros. They worked with me for help. The pain was so excruciating this Friday I had to be admmitted into the hospital. I had a CT scan and even more bad news. My spine can't be fixed by surgery . Now I wait for a biopsy to see where it started and if there's any possible course of treatment. I’m trying to get into MD Anderson. There’s some chance I’ll have insurance in January, but I really don’t know. God willing. Of course, I'm hoping for the best. I have a friend that has lived through 4th stage lung cancer for 10 yrs now, and I hold onto that hope. I have my God. I made peace with my Lord. As a Catholic, I went to confession to be absolved of my sins. I don't want to die, but I'm not afraid to. I know I will go to Heaven. I've always tried to live a good life and to be positive. This will be a hard road. I saw it first hand with my brother, a fireman at 911,  who died of lung cancer 12 yrs later. It's very sad, and I'm emotional here, late at night with the thought of my death running through my brain. My sweetheart of sweethearts has been helping me just by caring. Cynthia Migl, my Bubbles, has been one of a group of angels. BoBo Raley Morgan McKay. my sister Deb Green, Heidi Clark, Robyn Nygard, Rob Garcia, my family, my ex- the greatest ex! Tracy Lapierre and her husband Tony. Vince King, Brittany King, Tammy Mayfield a nurse who drove from Dallas to be with me to hear the news from the Oncologist, David Hicks, Linda Gajdousek Joyce... and my greatest angel, Jo Stone who guided me in this direction. I love everyone with all my heart, and I hope at some time in our times together, I’ve touched your heart and soul. Because love and faith is all we have. Dad always said MEMORIES ARE THE ONLY THING YOU CAN LEAVE FOR LOVED ONES LEFT BEHIND. I know this is long as I spill my late night thoughts of life and love,  but I do love you all, and I plan to fight this cancer. Just keep praying. Feel free to call or ask questions. It's day to day, but my big goal this year is to make it to my 30th year of working for the Houston Astros. God loves me. He's not punishing me. Prayers for me please.

It started as a love story between Diana and myself, but now has grown to include 2 others - our 2 young daughters. First let me introduce myself, My name is Marc Godfrey. My wife is Diana. We have 2 daughters - Angelina, who is 3 years old and our latest bundle of joy - Attalia, who is 9 weeks old. In 2014, Diana was diagnosed with Breast Cancer when she was 36 years old. She had surgery on her breast to remove the cancer. The good news at that time was that the cancer was contained. All her lymph nodes were negative and the cancer had not spread anywhere else. She was advised to start Radiation treatments after her surgery which she did. She had completed perhaps half of her radiation treatments when we found out that Diana was pregnant. Obviously we were not planning on this to happen and now this created a dilemma for us. Diana could not continue with her cancer treatments if she was pregnant as there was too much risk of the treatments harming the baby growing inside her. Diana was advised by several of her doctors that she should terminate her pregnancy so she could continue her cancer treatments. This was not an easy choice for Diana to make. She believed that the baby's life that was growing inside her was just as precious as her life. How can I terminate this life she asked me tearfully? So together we made the choice that Diana would continue with the pregnancy and that we would stop the cancer treatments therefore giving this new life the chance that it deserved.On October 18, 2015, Diana delivered our 2nd Daughter. We named her Attalia (named similar to Diana's Grandfather Attilio who passed away last February) Attalia was a beautiful, healthy baby girl. Angelina our older daughter was in love with her baby sister. She wanted to always hold her and smother her with kisses. She couldn't believe she had her own live baby doll. Life seemed to be so good for us. We were both so happy. The children were healthy. Diana was feeing great. She had a follow-up with her cancer Dr. last month who advised Diana that now that she had delivered the baby - we need to have a CAT scan to check her status and see how she's doing. Diana told her - Everything is fine. I've been eating really healthy, juicing, and I have never felt better in my life. Her Dr told her - this is just routine Diana.Well last week Diana's doctor called. And that is when our world came crashing down. She said I have bad news to tell you and I know it is one week before Christmas, but I don't feel that this can wait. The CAT scan she said showed that the cancer is Stage 4 and has spread to both of Diana's lungs and also to the bones in her pelvis and hip. We were devastated. Crying. Shocked. We never expected to get this type of report. However, when we look at our new baby daughter Attalia, we know without a doubt that we made the right choice to continue Diana's pregnancy. She is a gift from God. As Diana's husband, I am trying to be strong too but it is difficult. Diana is the rock of our family. She is the one that holds everything together. She is an amazing mother to our daughters. I cannot imagine our life without her.We are in the process of trying to secure the best care and treatment possible for Diana so she can fight this dreadful disease. We know that we are in for the fight of her life. It is going to be expensive and cost money that we do not have. Diana will not be able to work and her loss of income will affect our family as well. We are asking friends, family members, co-workers, acquaintances and even strangers who read our story and are impacted by it to help us. Whatever you feel you could comfortably contribute be it $10.00, $ 50.00, $ 100.00 $ 1000.00 or more. Any amount would be greatly appreciated and would help us tremendously. We also would ask you to pray for us - both as a family and for Diana specifically that she will beat this disease. God has the power to grant a miracle and that is what we are praying for. Angelina and Attalia need to have their mother and I need to have my wife by my side. Thank you for taking the time to read our story. I will post updates with regards to Diana's treatment and progress so check back on our page.Psalm 30:2 - Lord my God, I called to you for help and you heard me.Love, Marc, Diana and Family",d0197a164a4dc13d6f7586e8815674c6,55,0.92742,1110.0,1,1,0,3,0,2,0,0.003605769230769231,0.0,0.7572347266881029,3.868261645268759,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

To add to their circumstances, Saranya has begun to face a couple of medical set backs.As a final request, if you are reading this, could I please ask that you flood social media with their go-fund me page, please share on your facebook, twitter or whatsapp social network and ask others to do the same. They have two weeks to raise the much need funds to enable Saranya undertake the medical treatment in entirety.In addition, though the family are intensely private, they require gentle emotional and mental support, if you are a resident or visitor in Thailand, could you please reach out to them and give them some kindness and love. As a mother and wife, Saranya is concerned about the emotional and mental well-being of her husband and son.Thank you again.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In early 2018, our plans were thrown to the way side, at the age of 30, Saranya was diagnosed with Stage 3C clear cell carcinoma of the ovary arising in endometriosis (Stage 3C means cancer is in one or both ovaries and has spread beyond the pelvis to the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) or to nearby lymph nodes.)On 5 March 2018, Saranya battled on and underwent a modified hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, resection of the bladder and small bowel with a loop ileostomy. Post-surgery, my lovely, Saranya, gladly endured 14 weeks of chemo, to be with Karthiks and I. Post chemo, Saranya’s tumour markers were low and CT scans showed no indication of tumours, however, within 3 months, the aggressive cancer returned and showed resistance to chemo.With the cancer being resistant to chemo, the only other option, Saranya has left is to undergo immunotherapy. Unfortunately, immunotherapy is not available in Australia and we will need to travel overseas, to Verita Life, Thailand for the treatment.To fund Saranya’s cancer treatment and care, I have availed our life savings, In addition, I have taken a personal loan. My only other option is to request our friends, family and Indian & Australian communities to kindly assist us, as much, as you can bear. If you cannot provide us with monetary assistance, could we please ask, that you pray for us, send us your healing energy, share our story/page and support us by any means, you can. My hope is that the immunotherapy allows Saranya to recover from cancer and spend time making memories with our two-year-old son, Karthiks.

Although this is the case, we have come to find providers that can avoid removing her eye, while providing a cure.  This cancer only occurs at a rate of 0.4 per million, with the majority of cases documented being in the middle east.  Oncologists are not even taught about it in med school because they will likely never encounter it.We have found a team of doctors with much experience with her cancer in Pittsburgh, PA.  Her big surgery to remove the tumor is scheduled on Wednesday, November 21st, 2018.  We anticipate 1 day in the ICU, followed by 4-5 more days in the hospital.  She will then come home to heal for 4-6 weeks before radiation begins.Any finacial assistance you can offer (even $5.00) will be most appreciated! The bills are already overwhelming.  Any money collected will be used for her medical treatment.  If there is extra we would appreciate to be able to use it for food and travel when we must be out of town for her care.Miranda has signed up to be part of a 5 year research study to add to the limited information available regarding this cancer.  We truely hope this can help others in the future.Thank you so much for reading our story.  Please post it to your social media and share with your friends and family!  EVERY little bit helps and this only works if it is shared! https://www.gofundme.com/support-miranda-kings-cancer-fund&rcid=r01-154222529296-b3bea24919b641cf&pc=ot_co_campmgmt_w",10f13ad7df46b28fe5cca2dfaa6a860b,21,0.30218,60.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

On May 3rd, 2018 I was told heart breaking news that my mom, Nichole, was diagnosed with stage 4 NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer). This was the day we just came back from visiting my sister in Florida. She decided to go to the ER because she could feel something wasn’t right. I didn’t think it was going to be anything serious, she’s a healthy 44 year old woman... but it was found that she had multiple blood clots. After running countless tests they finally found the clots were caused by lung cancer. They saw the mass in her right lung, a tumor on her spine, a tumor on her neck, and traces in the brain.     Doctors immediately started radiation with 10 treatments on each tumor. In the middle of all of this she started having seizures. So she was transferred to a hospital that could figure out why she was having them. In the week she was at that second hospital she had over 15 seizures and a stroke. She had to have 3 lumbar punctures, the first showed traces of cancer in the spinal fluid. The other two were to lower her spinal fluid pressure so she wouldn’t go blind. It was hard watching her go through so much pain. Fortunately, the doctors were able to get the seizures under control so she was then transferred to a third hospital that could start her brain radiation.      These radiation treatments have started to make her lose her hair. My mom is a strong woman but even the strongest person would be hurt to see their hair slowly fall out. I’m going to look for a beautiful, durable wig for her. She deserves one that will last. Also, from her having the seizures she can’t drive for the next year so she’ll have to rely on rides and public transportation while still having a car payment. Asking for help is the last thing she would do but sometimes it’s necessary.      Shes a single mom with 3 jobs and is no longer able to work until the Immunotherapy treatments are over. The treatments are nearly killing her. She goes in once every 3 weeks for about 5 hours, those 5 hours turn into days and days of unbearable pain. She only has my sister and I left to help in her life, I’m 19 and live over an hour away from her and my sister lives in Florida. I’m begging for anyone’s help, she’s my best friend. I don’t have much to give, but my mom has always tried her best for me so I need to do the same for her. We’ve been saving money to move to Florida in 2 years so we could open up a store together and be closer to my sister, but that has to be put on pause until we can get this under control. The doctors are very hopeful that she can get through this. I honestly don’t know how long she has left until we get through a full round of immunotherapy. So until we find that new out, I want every day to be as good as it can be for her. If she were to go I would at least want to have money for a funeral. Any donations made will be used to help pay for medications, doctor visits, transportation and just daily essential needs.

A few years later, another devastating challenge came when Katie (the second child) was diagnosed with bone cancer of the lower jaw at the young age of 12.  Soon afterwards, Becky (the youngest) was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 13. Then a few years after that, Tessie (the eldest child) was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 20. One year after Tessie's treatment, Katie (then 19) was diagnosed with breast cancer, and in 2016 was diagnosed with colon cancer that had metastasized to her ovary. This year, both Tessie and Becky were also diagnosed with new cancers – Tessie was diagnosed with bone cancer in her upper jaw, while Becky was diagnosed with bone cancer in her ribs.             When their dad Paul was alive, he was an editor, writer, owner, and distributor of the Wednesday Magazine in Kitsap County, Washington for many years until his final days.  Beth, mother and wife, helped Paul run their business which she continued to manage after Paul’s passing. However, when the children were diagnosed with cancer, Beth could no longer keep the business running full-time by herself so she had to close it and pursue part-time employment. Over the years, Beth worked tirelessly juggling her schedule between jobs to sustain their family’s financial needs while tending to her three children who, at times, were undergoing surgeries and treatments at separate hospitals distantly located from their home. As a single mom, caring for one child suffering from cancer is very challenging physically, emotionally, and financially – now imagine having all three children with cancer.              Despite the limitations and challenges cancer has put them through, all three Goheen girls have been successfully living normal lives personally and professionally until their recent diagnoses and treatment plans made it impossible for them to work. Becky had surgery on September 13, 2018 at the University of Washington Medical Center. Tessie underwent surgery on September 24, 2018. Katie is no longer responding well to chemotherapy and the family is looking for other available treatments that could possibly help.            We are raising funds to support the Goheen family for lost income, ongoing medical expenses, travel expenses to and from the hospital, and any of the family's needs. If cancer has impacted you or someone you know and love in any way, you understand the devastating impact it can cause on your life physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, and financially – most especially when cancer has hit not only one, but four members of the family.            Every little bit helps.  When a close relative asked Beth: “Would you like me to be there with you?"" She said shyly, “I would love you to come, but honestly can you just continue working at your job and send me gas money instead?” We know Beth very well. Despite her dire financial situation, she is always shy to ask anyone for financial help. For her to ask for gas money means they are now in a desperate situation.  That is why we feel led to create a GoFundMe account for the Goheen family.            You may easily spend five dollars on a coffee break – but for this family it could mean gas money from one hospital to another. If you are unable to give for whatever reason, could you at least forward or share this story with anyone you know who may be able to help.  Contributing is a simple, but very meaningful way to support the Goheen Team in this difficult time.            As an old Proverb says:  Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.              Your prayers and help are highly appreciated. Thank you very much!",3277e40a5e4db9b9fa84a450796780cc,29,0.37152,120.0,3,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0015503875968992248,0.0,0.036122661122661125,1.16896501488331,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

My name is Addi Steinert, and I’m creating this page on behalf of my mom, Becki Steinert, to share her story. In one moment a person’s life can change! My family’s and, most of all my mom’s,  did the day we found out she has lung cancer. It all started just a little over a month ago. My mom started having a minor pain in her lung. This prompted a doctor visit to Cass Lake over the holidays, where a lesion on her right lung was discovered. This required a biopsy for suspected lung cancer. The biopsy was positive and confirmed by a follow-up appointment with Dr. Jerry Johnson at St. Luke’s in Duluth on January 10th. The diagnosis: small cell lung cancer.  For those of you who aren’t familiar, small cell lung cancer is an aggressive type of cancer that is not the type of cancer that can be cut out surgically. Unfortunately, the only treatment is advanced chemotherapies. Since the diagnosis,  it’s been scheduling MRI’s and PET scans to figure out the severity of the illness. Thank God, the MRI on Mom’s brain confirmed the cancer has not spread there! Great news! But we have a long battle ahead of us. We currently are working on obtaining health insurance to help with the medical expenses, but, as of now, she doesn’t have it. We know there will be many trips back and forth to Duluth for treatment and doctor appointments. My mom is a fighter, and we have faith, but the cost of treatment and expenses has caused a lot of stress. My family and I graciously ask for any support you can offer to help a woman who would give the shirt off her back to help someone in need as she fights the big fight! We are grateful for any donation.  Thank you and God Bless!",20082e4a335691432ef734a8568c34ca,22,0.05346153846153846,12.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Within days surgery was performed but due to the severity of the tumor, between 10-30% of is still located on his brain, and unable to be removed (it's 2cm deep and pushing against the hypothalamus). A node was also located on one of his lungs, so it's possible that the upcoming chemo therapy and radiation treatments may help with that as well. Don has been an incredible asset to the SD Sheriffs Dept, Sycuan PD, and has unselfishly given up much of his time to help others- including his wife Missy, whose son has been missing for over 7 years.

Within the next couple of days she was laid out on the couch uninterested in playing and talking with friends and began not being interested in food.  I took her to her pediatrician a couple days later to get her knee checked out. Blood work was done and an xray of her knee, and it showed some inflammation in the knee and blood work came back that her A&A was not right so we were sent to a pediatric orthopedic doctor and had an appointment for rheumatology. the orthopedic doctor thought that she could possibly have juvenile arthritis. So we waited for the rheumatologist appointment. During the wait for the appt. Emily's condition was getting worse, she was not even interested in ice cream or fruit some of her favorite things, all she wanted and could do was sleep and she became unmobile and could no longer walk without collapsing. We were very worried and thought wow arthritis can really put a kid down literally. On June 26th after seeing the doctor and being sent across the street to emergency at the Detroit Children's Hospital we got the biggest bomb dropped on us... Emily had CANCER! I was in shock and absolutely devastated and heartbroken. I just stood there with tears flying down my face just listening to the team of doctors explain to me that they were thinking she had Leukemia or Lymphoma because her blood was nothing but toxic. In the next couple of days and being admitted to Children's and having more blood work,Blood transfusions, chest xray, ultra sound, Bone marrow surgery taken samples and a CT Scan. The team of doctors had a diagnosis for us, Emily had Neuroblastoma Cancer and she had a large tumor in the center of her chest and another large tumor on her left abdomen and to top it off cancer tumors all over in her bone marrow. Yesterday June 28th, Emily went back to surgery to have a biopsy of the tumor in her abdomen and to have a port inserted under her skin for chemo could begin. Early this morning June 29th, she was put back under for the 3rd day in a row to have a MRI done of her brain. We do not have those results yet since she just came out about an hour ago, but we are praying for the best. My little girl is laying in a hospital bed with incisions and iv's in both arms and now a port in her chest. She can't even hardly move she is in soo much pain, they just keep switching between Tylenol (She keeps having fevers that are around 105) and morphine. I can hardly even see while trying to type this I am soo upset and can't understand why this is happening to my little girl, she is only 4 years old and her long journey to hopefully recovery has just begun. I have no idea how we will get through this, I just keep thinking no way, no way she WILL get through this! A little bit about our family~In our home in Clarkston Michigan, Emily lives with me (her mother, my name is Jennifer) her father Patrick, her older sister Lilly who is 10 and their little sister Lucy who is 1 and a half, and our little doggie Ruby. We are a very close family that loves to go and do everything together, our children are our world. I am a stay at home mom and Patrick is a very hard working man. We live pay check to pay check and are not sure with all the unpaid time Patrick has already taken off, and how we will afford our bills and weekly groceries and expenses. Right now we are switching out with each other and driving back and fourth to Detroit from Clarkston which is about an hour drive with traffic, we have already spent a few hundred $ on gas alone. So in turn I am asking for donations to help with expenses and bills, I'm not even sure how we will pay for rent for July. Emily does have heath insurance but I highly doubt they are going to cover all this and she hasn't even stated chemo yet, and also asking for prayers and good thoughts for our family. This has affected and devastated EVERYONE in our family. If you can not donate I just ask for prayers please and lots of them.

This past week, he was diagnosed with fibrosarcoma. That means Gunner has cancer in his mouth.Originally, Gunner visited his vet for routine dental work in March.  His humans and his doctor thought he had a bad tooth. His tooth was extracted, and then another tooth the first week of August. The swelling and drooling did not stop, so the vet took another look…and found a mass in Gunner’s mouth. It was removed and biopsied on September 25. The vet took what he could of the mass, but he was unable to remove the entire lump. Unfortunately, the odds were not in Gunner’s favor, and this little one will now fight hard to win this battle. To Know Gunner Is To Love GunnerThere is more you need to know about Gunner. He is a Velcro dog, very true to his Vizsla heritage.  Snuggling with him is like hugging a velvet pillow. Gunner has no idea what personal space means, and is a joyful boy.He is friendly with other dogs, and is a happy with an empty paper towel roll as he is with his favorite frog toy. Gunner wears his emotions proudly, and you can always tell his mood by his face. Gunner either looks like a little old man, or he has a “derpy” look. He has never met a stranger.Gunner’s HumansGunner has two humans, Kim and Mike.  Kim’s career includes caring for everyone else’s dog, and Mike has mad welding skills. They adopted Gunner when he was only 5 ½ months old. Mike and Kim just moved to Texas three weeks prior, and read about this puppy on Craig’s List. That was almost four years ago.To see Kim with Gunner is to see love. He adores his human, and Kim is most definitely Gunner’s human. Gunner is Kim’s heart in a fur suit. Gunner follows Kim everywhere, even when he is playing.For those of you who have never met his humans, I want to tell you about his mom, Kim.Kim is a woman with a heart of gold. She is wise beyond her years, and kind to her core. Kim is the consummate, calm soul who cares for all dogs as if they were her own. I know this firsthand because she has cared for my dogs. Without her, there would be many people (myself included) who are simply lost. There would be many unhappy dogs in this world.As I drop off my dog and other clients come in the door to do the same, Kim greets every dog by name and they happily bound over to her. We are forgotten, and our fur kids are so happy to be with Kim. This is such a good thing for the humans, as we worry about them and feel guilty for even going to work.  You see, our dogs visit Kim at CityDog! Club, where she works. Kim has taken care of three of my dogs at their best and worst moments in life. When two of our dogs had bone cancer at different times in the past year, Kim was there. She cared for them so we could keep working to pay the bills. She cared for our boy after his leg amputation. She cared for our girl after her biopsy. Kim made sure they were never scared, lonely, and that they always knew love in their last months when we could not be at their sides. When we lost our dogs, Kim was one of the first people to console us. She continues to care for our Doberman, Franklin, as he grows. She is patient, kind, and always does what is best for the dogs in her life.Kim has never met a dog she cannot handle, and she does all of this with love.Why You Should GiveKim and Mike are humble, honest people. They care for Gunner, and his furry brothers, Lambeau and The Dude, in the best ways possible. Kim and Mike are normally private people; instead of burdening others with their troubles, they try to make everything work.  The only thing Kim asked for was “positive vibes, good juju, and prayers” for Gunner. If only positive vibes could beat cancer.  Cancer is expensive. Cancer treatments are expensive. Gunner’s prognosis is guarded but good. There are a few obstacles in Gunner's way. If the surgeon can take the rest of the mass (with good margins), they will operate on this sweet boy and perform a partial mandibulectomy. This means part of Gunner's jaw will need to be removed, but it could save his life. It sounds harsh, but Gunner can learn how to use his jaw like a normal dog and live a normal life.  In Dallas, where we live and work, radiation oncology treatments are expensive.Gunner needs up to twenty sessions of radiologic therapy.Gunner needs a special diet, as he can no longer eat hard food for the time being.Gunner needs so much, including medications, therapy, and all of the other items you do not know you need when your dog is diagnosed with cancer.Kim’s first thought when she found out her sweet boy had cancer was how to care for Gunner.For her, Gunner is her focus.For those of us who have traveled the cancer road with our faithful companions, we know that there is enough anguish and worry involved. Finances make it more worrisome and frustrating.Please help, however you can, as Gunner needs you.Costs of CareRight now, the following costs are associated with Gunner's Care:CT Scan: $1,570.00-This includes the following: diagnostic scan, catheter, anesthesia, pulse ox monitor, supplies for the scan, review of the scan, and any needed fluidsSurgery: $3,500.00- Gunner is a candidate for surgery! So, he will be having surgery soon! Radiology Sessions: $6,300.00- This includes the following: EEG monitor, catheter, anesthesia, nursing fees, day care fees, NSAIDs, machine timeOffice visits: $150.00 per visit- This is simply to walk in the door and see the specialists. If Gunner visits the doctor ten times (which is a conservative estimate), that is $1,500.00This does not include daily medication, food, follow up appointments, blood work, pill pockets, and all of the other items needed to battle cancer. Therefore, I put a conservative estimate of $15,000.",e7f8335ccc80864528b46c5bdbd20218,58,0.9438095238095238,90.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

My beautiful niece Jordyn, age five (5), was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor and given a short-term life expectancy.Doctors have explained that the tumor, known as Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), is a very rare and aggressive form of cancer typically found in children ages 5-9. Only 200-300 children in the United States each year are diagnosed with DIPG as they struggle to find a cure. This type of tumor is located at the base of the brain (brainstem) and the top of the spine. Over time, it will impact all of Jordyn’s essential bodily functions: heartbeat, breathing, swallowing, eyesight and balance. My brother Mike, sister in law Joanna, their son Alex, age two (2), and our families are shattered by this diagnosis. Doctors at The IWK Children’s Hospital in Halifax, NS have informed us that radiation treatments are the best we can do as we aim to keep Jordyn comfortable for her remaining time. We struggle to grasp what we are being told, and will exhaust every resource available in our fight.With all of these efforts comes a financial burden that no family should have to worry about while desperately trying to save the life of their child. Jordyn is the eldest of Mike and Joanna and shines bright amongst her brother and 5 cousins! Jordyn has spunk, sass and a fun personality. She likes to dance, ride her bike, fish, play silly games and is a practical joke enthusiast. In fact, it’s hard to find one picture where she isn’t making someone smile. She loves her grandparents and being with her family and friends. Losing Jordyn will leave a dimness in so many lives where light presently shines so bright. Please help Mike, Joanna and Alex by sending your strongest and most positive vibes to Jordyn and our family. All donations are deeply appreciated and will allow us to do whatever needs to be done to give Jordyn a fighting chance in the limited time we have.Thank you from the depth of my soul and bottom of my heart.

He had just moved back to Las Vegas only days before. He was very excited to begin this new chapter in his life, having years of experience as a tour pilot in Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon and Chicago. In the days leading up to this particular Saturday, he was experiencing terrible headaches. Within the hour of taking passengers up on his first flight, he fell to the ground in a grand-mal seizure. He was transported to the hospital by ambulance, where a CT and MRI showed 3 lesions in his brain. In the week that followed, a spinal tap and other tests ruled out the possibilities of other disease / disorders.It was determined, he needed surgery, to remove as much of the tumor for biopsy as possible, and after pathology from labs in Las Vegas and Mayo Clinic, it was determined that Mike has brain cancer. What was not determined, was the type or stage of cancer he has. The possibility now to do more brain surgery to remove the tumors is not an option, and he was told by his neurosurgeon that Las Vegas has no place for him to receive any treatment.Doing research now for the best possible center to determine what the exact type of cancer he has and  treatment, is our number one priority. It is a reality now that he’ll have to relocate soon to another part of the country.The large medical expenses for him are mounting very quickly. The medicines for swelling in the brain and anti-seizure, the cost of relocating, housing, not being able to work, and Cobra coverage for insurance, is very high to name a few.If you would be willing to consider in any way, helping offset the costs of all of this unexpected turn of life events, it would be so greatly appreciated.

In June of 2018 Claudia was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, which had spread to her lymph nodes, lungs, bones, and liver. Pancreatic cancer is usually terminal, especially at this stage,  and requires immediate and intense treatment. Standardized medical care guarantees only a 2% recovery rate, and requires aggressive chemotherapy and radiation, which also equally guarantees a poor and debilitating quality of life. After much prayer and research, Claudia has found a renowned alternative and integrative clinic in Mexico, just across the border from San Diego, known for its high rate of success in healing terminal cancer, and other chronic and traditionally incurable diseases. The medical tourism industry in Mexico is the highest in the world, and people from all over the globe come to get cured. Treatments which are efficient in curing cancer and other chronic diseases, which are not FDA approved in the US save people's lives here. Stem cell therapy, immunotherapies and metabolic therapies, including vaccines made from your own blood and body are at the forefront of healing people who, like Claudia, were given a life sentence back home. Her doctor has been at the forefront of curing cancer for 25 years, and he is a world renowned immunologist, who patented his own successful anti-cancer vaccine.  Powerful anti-cancer natural vaccines, supplements and antioxidants in the forms of IV's are administered daily to support the immune system, with a very low dose of insulin targeted chemotherapy which often has no side effects.  Claudia's sensitive system would not allow for full dose radiation and chemotherapy which was the only option in the States, and which would have only guaranteed her a couple of extra months to live with no chance of survival. Please read Claudia's recent blog and account of the medical industry in Mexico, and how you and others can also be saved from certain death by thinking outside of the box, and looking at alternative treatments outside the US. ""If you have  health insurance, that is actually your Death Insurance,"" Claudia wrote. Find out why, and about her first hand account talking to patients for the past 6 months who were sent home to die, but were saved coming to Mexico, and are now in remission!""Dying To Live In Mexico:""  https://claudiaghetuwellness.com/2018/11/23/dying-to-live-in-mexico/Needless to say, Claudia's insurance will not pay for the kind of treatment she has chosen. Insurance companies profit from the trillion dollar pharmaceutical global industry, with cancer treatment being at the top driving our economy! So, all of Claudia's costs are out of pocket! As you’ll see from her updates, she is making significant progress, and would have not otherwise succeeded in making it this far with traditional treatment.  The 100% standardized chemo therapy dosage, as it was relayed to her by her first integrative oncologist back in July, would have put her in a coma in less than a month.  Many people die from chemotherapy and radiation, and Claudia didn't want to ever undergo that inhumane and antiquated treatment, when there are in fact integrative and alternative options which guarantee a good chance of success even when dealing with pancreatic cancer. Also as a holistic health consultant, who has always believed in natural methods for healing the mind and body, Claudia knew immediately she wanted non-traditional and compassionate care,  in alignment with her own personal philosophy and spiritual core beliefs.  Initially the money required for treatment and the goal posted was $50K, which was to cover only the first 6-8 weeks of treatment, however after many subsequent tests Claudia and as per her doctors’  assessments, she needs to continue with 10 more months of medical care. In October Claudia had a set-back due to the metastasis in her bones, after she had made great improvements on her pancreas and liver, with tumors shrinking  at an accelerated rate, which impressed all the doctors.  She nearly lost her life, as she became suddenly incapacitated with excruciating pain in the spine and throughout all her  bones and muscles. Part of the reason was because she had taken a break from treatment and switched clinics, and was also low on funds and could not continue her treatment without interruption. This is when all the amazing people like you, kicked it and helped her find her current doctor and clinic which have saved her life. Her kind and extremely compassionate doctor, who took her in despite her lack of funds in October,  is a world renowned immunologist, and has successfully treated many well known people and alternative care advocates, including Suzanne Summers who continues to refer patients to hime, and credits him for saving her life! If you would like to find out who he is, you can contact Claudia directly. Claudia has applied for Social Security Disability Benefits which will not be available until next year. She has gone for the past 6 months without any government support, even though in her case they should have started paying her within a month of applying (July) due to the compassionate act for terminally ill cancer patients.  Your continued support will be of immense help, even once her small social security stipend kicks in early next year, as that would only cover the cost of rent and basic food. Claudia has always believed that true healing comes from  connecting to our divine nature, a supportive and spiritual environment, and from deep within ourselves. Her belief in God is unwavering and she is filled with divine gratitude, knowing that she was given this obstacle to overcome, only to transcend beyond worldly limitations and help others. As an Integrative Holistic Health Counselor, Nutritional Chef, and yoga and meditation teacher, she lives what she teaches  and is known to go the extra mile to empower, support,  and inspire those around her.  Even a few days before she was diagnosed, short of energy and barely able to eat, she visited someone in the hospital to give them wellness and spiritual counseling, and cooked for her clients until the day she had to go to the emergency room, making sure they wouldn’t miss out on their healthy meals. She has dedicated her life to helping others facing mental, emotional and physical challenges, and those seeking to transition to a healthier mind-body-spirit lifestyle. Now, she is the one in need of our support. She is using her own healing modalities to heal herself combined with the help of an amazing team of alternative doctors, who support her holistic choices, providing her with the compassion and motivation which she has always shown to others. She bravely turned down traditional chemotherapy and radiation treatments, which would only give her a 2% chance of survival. Those who know her well call her a warrior! She is not only fighting for her own life, but as she so often says “I am here fighting for everyone, so they can learn through me that cancer too can be overcome with the right integrative medical treatment and support, and through sheer faith, and will power!” Let’s help her achieve her goal, her medical expenses will far extend the amount we are asking. Please share this link with your various social media contacts or personal acquaintances, and kindly add a personal message to it, as this seems to make a big difference. You can read more about Claudia’s remarkable and brave story via her recent blog on her website ClaudiaGhetuWellness “How Cancer is Healing Me!” Claudia wants to live and help others by giving back. So many people like her are given a death sentence, but cancer doesn’t have to be an end, but a beginning!Claudia and her family are deeply grateful for your love, prayers and support.   With much love and gratitude.",dd47aa3e00325b626ff67aa6d0d5a156,45,0.62271,210.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I am 23 years old and a Senior at West Virginia University studying International Studies with an emphasis in Business. While attending WVU I was able to be a part of the Collegiate Swimming and Diving Teams. Due to illness I had to withdraw from my classes last semester, but plan on finishing my degree this Spring. I hope to then enter a Master's Program in Mental Health and Rehabilitation Counseling to give me the opportunity to help people who may be going through similar struggles to the ones I have faced. I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Testicular Cancer in July of 2018, and received a surgery to remove the mass. Upon completion of the surgery the cancer was found to have moved to my Lymph Nodes. I have since been through Four rounds of Chemotherapy, was hospitalized twice, and now am facing another surgery to remove a mass in my Abdomen & Lymph Nodes.Today I received news that the mass has encapsulated my Aorta and also my Inferior Vena Cava. I have what is called a mixed germ cell tumor which contained 4 different kinds of Cancer. The Chemotherapy killed 3 of the 4 types of Cancer, but didn't affect the last kind in the mass which is bigger than my liver. I now am forced to  schedule a 6 to 8 hour surgery at Indiana University to remove it.  My doctors here recommended that I seek treatment in Indiana because this type of surgery is outside of the areas of expertise of my team and the doctors in Indiana deal with this type of surgery on a more frequent basis.  It is about a five hour trip there and I will be hospitalized for at least 4 days which only adds to my medical expenses as well as the cost of travel and lodging for me and my loved ones. I haven't been able to work due to treatment and now with the completion of my Chemo the Medical Bills are substantial. Anything you can give would be more than appreciated. My family and I would be eternally grateful for your contributions and even if you can't give anything sharing this fundraiser would mean the world to us.I want to thank each and everyone who has shared, and generously donated to make this opportunity possible. I am truly grateful to have the continued love and support throughout this challenging period in my life.

I honestly don't really know where to begin in writing this but I do know she needs some help. I'm reaching out to you in hopes that you would be willing to help her get the care she needs. She was recently diagnosed with Stage IV Breast Cancer that has metastasized to her bones. She has multiple lesions in several places. Stage IV is the most advanced stage of cancer and there is no cure. Our mother, Amber, is a strong woman of faith and she refuses to accept a death sentence so she is buckling down to fight this thing with all that is within her! Some of you may know, she has had breast cancer twice before and she rocked it like it was the common cold. This cancer is proving to be quite a bit more aggressive and, statistically speaking, has a much lower survival rate. The median survival rate is 3 years. Our family refuses to accept this but quick action is needed. She wants to take the alternative medicine route so we have been gathering information on Autohemotherapy. This is a newer technology that is, unfortunately, not covered by insurance. This treatment has some awesome success stories but it doesn't come without a price, of course! It is quite expensive but life is priceless. The problem is that we don't have the money to pay for this on our own. It is $600 for every session. Patients have seen favorable results within 6-10 sessions. Similar cases have shown the best results between 15-25 sessions. Each session will last about 5-6 hours so she'll be taking time off from work at least twice a week to receive this treatment. I can imagine that you are thinking this sounds absurdly expensive and, honestly, I agree. But I can't let price be a factor so I'm laying pride aside and asking for you to please help fight this nasty disease! As the treatments progress, they will be monitoring her bloodwork to determine whether or not it is accomplishing the goal at hand (which is killing the cancer cells in her body). If for some reason, this treatment becomes ineffective, Plan B will be put into motion. Plan B is traveling just over 600 miles to MD Anderson in Houston, Texas. Treatment costs should minimize with this option, due to insurance, but there would inevitably be travels costs and several week-long stays resulting in expenses that we just simply do not have. I give you my word that whatever you have in your heart to donate will absolutely go toward the array of expenses incurred from our mother's care (treatments, lodging, travel, etc.). Any donation received will be such a blessing and relief. We pray God's favor on you and that you never have a reason to make a request such as this. Thank you for all your help! We've set our initial goal at $3,600 just so we can get her started with treatment, as time is of the essence. The costs will undoubtedly amount to much more than this but prompt action is vital.

Greta took her last breath snuggled between her Mama and DadaThe pain we feel is unbearable, and words cannot express how much we already miss her, but we know our girl is no longer suffering. Our hearts are broken and will NEVER be the same. We LOVE you Miss Greta. #gladiatorgreta-----------------------------------------------------------------------This is Greta! And this is the story of Greta's battle with cancer...Greta was a happy, healthy energetic baby. Then she started having some vague symptoms, unexplained fever, a little nausea, less stamina. After various tests Greta went for an ultrasound and that's when our world was forever changed. The scans showed Greta had a mass on her liver. In September 2015, days before she turned 2 years old, Greta was diagnosed with Hepatoblastoma – an extremely rare liver cancer found in fewer than 1 in a million children.Greta started her first chemo treatment on her 2nd birthday. She tolerated her treatment extremely well!  Though she lost her hair and had to be isolated because of low immunity, Greta remained a happy, exuberant child. At the end of March 2016 – after 2 major surgeries, 10 chemotherapy sessions and endless pokes and procedures, she was done her treatment and had ""no evidence of disease"". The Oncologists said recurrence was unlikely. We were overjoyed!  We enjoyed the summer with Greta and her big brother Ben. Spending lots of time at the lake and watching her change from a baby to a little girl. Then, on a routine follow up doctor visit, we had disturbing results from a blood test - it looked like the cancer was back. More tests and scans revealed that it was. The good news was that it had not metastasized. We started chemo all over again almost exactly a year after the first round and were told she would need a liver transplant. We have been working extensively with doctors in Calgary, Toronto and Cincinnati on how best to take care of Greta’s relapsed hepatoblastoma (liver cancer).  Our Canadian doctors have done everything they can to help but, in this case, our system is far behind many of the large centers in the world.Dr. Geller, a paediatric oncologist at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, has a special interest in hepatoblastoma and much more experience than any Canadian doctors. . He has spoken with us at length about Greta's situation and has offered to help in any way he can. With being denied a transplant in Canada, he is our only chance to get Greta a healthy liver. He has been working closely with our Canadian doctors but is convinced he can do more to help Greta than is possible here. In his practice he has been personally been involved in 9 rescue liver transplants (transplant after resection) and 8 of these children are doing well! Dr. Geller believes Greta has and deserves a shot at life.But it is expensive! We are travelling to Cincinnati right away to start the evaluation process for a possible liver transplant and a procedure called T.A.R.E  which will help to hopefully stabilize her tumour and prevent it from spreading beyond her liver but we need approximately  $150K US for the procedure.  However, there is a chance they would be able to transplant right away. This would require A LOT more money.We asked for the cost of this treatment and were told that for initial evaluation, transplant surgery and follow up care and chemo until she can return home it would be USD $1.2M.  Above this would be travel and living expenses for us, Greta's parents, while she is in Cincinnati. At this time, AB Health Care will not be covering the cost of Greta’s transplant surgery.We need help! And we need it right away. Greta's life depends on it. So much of the journey through childhood cancer is lonely and isolating, but our friends and family have rallied around to support us as best they can. And we need you now more than ever. Every single dollar will help give Greta a chance at life, a chance she deserves.  If any funds collected are unused for Greta's care we will donate them to a Children's cancer care/research charity. Words cannot express how greatful we are for all the support and donations. Thank you!Love Steve, Lindsey, Ben and Greta xoxoInformation requested by GoFundMe:My name is Katie Findlay and I am a long time family friend working on behalf of the Marofke's to raise money to help Greta.

After graduating high school, they married, and started a family. Ken and Sabrina now live in the small upstate New York town of Rotterdam with their children, Kenny Jr. (14) and Angelina (11) who are both very active in sports in the Mohonasen School District. In 2011, at the young age of 34, Sabrina noticed a rash on her skin and made an appointment with her primary doctor. After months of being treated for psoriasis and eczema with no relief, her doctor diagnosed Sabrina with Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma, also known as CTCL. Soon after, Sabrina was referred to a specialist at Yale University to begin treatment.In January of 2012, Sabrina began intense treatment for Sezary Syndrome, the most aggressive form of CTCL. Not only does Sezary affect the skin, but also the blood and lymph nodes. Sabrina’s treatment plan consisted of travel to New Haven, Connecticut every four weeks for intense therapy, leaving her unable to work, as well as Ken and her two kids behind in New York. By early 2014, Sabrina’s skin was cleared and the Leukemia completely eliminated. Sabrina, like most people who have a form of cancer, knew that she would have to fight for life. Fast forward to October 2018 when Sabrina started to notice a familiar rash on her skin. The rashes spread quickly and began causing extreme pain all over her body. Ken and Sabrina have worked hard to sustain their home and provide for their two children. Both working full time jobs, juggling football practice with cheerleading and softball, and still finding time to be with one another. Sabrina’s fight has forced her out of work, turning a dual income household into a single income household. As Sabrina’s battle has progressed, Ken has been forced to take time from his job to care for his loving wife and their children, further reducing their household income. We are asking that family, friends, and anyone willing to help please donate to the Girard family in their time of need. Between paying thousands of dollars for treatment alone, along with travel expenses, care for the kids, food, hotels, and so much more – the Girard family needs our help. There is no donation too small. Words of encouragement and a small donation can go a long way at a time like this.

This year was to be my final year at the University of Central Florida for an electrical engineering degree. I had an internship at NASA's Kennedy Space Center working with Atlantis Education Services Space Trek summer camp program. I was able to convince Space Trek to sponsor my senior design project which was to be completed this spring. I proposed to my girlfriend of three years and we now live together. In June of this year I weighed 170 lbs (77 kilo) and decided it was time to get into shape. By September I had lost 10 lbs (4.5 kilo) and noticed a lump in my abdomen. By November it became a bulge and I decided I needed to see a doctor. I had two scans, a CT and an MRI, and by Thanksgiving week my doctor referred me to an oncologist for a potential caner diagnosis. I had a biopsy on December 4th and my doctor was able to confirm that I have a desmoplastic small cell sarcoma in my pelvis which has spread to my lungs, lymphatic system, and liver. I have spent the past week (12/18-12/23) recieving my first regiment of chemotherapy at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa Florida. The doctors here are confident that they can save me this time but my future is pretty bleak.To give some numbers:Sarcomas make up 1% of all cancer diagnosis, abdominal/pelvic sarcomas make up 20% of all sarcomas, and 40% of those are stage IV. The survival rates for this cancer, the chance I have of this disease recurring after remisssion, are bleak. There is a 40% three year survival rate and only a 15% five year survival rate. I have been told I will see 30 only if I'm very lucky.My luck has been pretty horrid in regards to my diagnosis but I'm not giving up. My family and my fiance's family are both dedicated to helping me beat this disease in the immediate future so I can live the remainder of my life to the absolute fullest. If there is a physical way I WILL return to school and finish my remaining classes. Once I'm well enough I WILL return to Kennedy Space Center.  To make this happen I need HELP. The only way I will survive is to focus my entire mind on staying well. I'm currently extremely healthy (except for the cancer ha) which gives me a much better shot at getting at least one good year of limited pain. I want so much more but if I can get that one year I think I can do everything I need to do. I have had an amazing life but I wanted to do so much more. I'm an inventor and hobbiest in my spare time. I've built several guitar effects pedals, a 1-watt laser, and most of a portable Nintendo 64. I still have so much to offer to the world but without assistance I will be swamped with bills. I have always earned my own way. I have worked steadily since I was 14, have always had good grades in school, and overall wanted to remain self sufficient. I hate this disease. It stole my future from me. Here are more awful numbers:I have $37,000 in student loans that I have to start making payments on in 6 months.I have already accrued $8,000 in medical bills in the past month.My living expenses are $1200 a month for now but I will have to change my diet to reduce the chance of bacterial infection. That number will rise to $1300-1400.Medical supplies to keep me alive during my treatment will cost me another $200 per month.I don't even know how much my prescription medication will cost.Any money raised from this campaign will go directly to saving my life. $5 will buy me one meal, $50 will cover the cost of traveling from Orlando to Tampa for treatment, what I'm trying to convey is that every dollar removes extra stress from my life. If getting better is the only thing I have to worry about, then I am confident that I will survive this round. I need any donations as soon as possible because medical bills are already pilling up. Once I'm well enough, I will complete my degree and can use that experience to find a job. Without my degree, I have tons of debt and no way to start paying it. If I had my degree this would be an entirely different situation. It is just not possible for me to pay off this amount of debt without a degree, but I cannot get my degree without at least starting to pay the debt off. Donating to my campaign will help ensure that once I'm well I can get back on my feet. There is no point in getting chemotherapy, potential surgery, etc. if once I'm done I will neither afford to live nor have the degree to make a decent living. Please help me. My family and I cannot do this alone.",66ab459132020377f5f55165a8838dcb,44,0.6198,1110.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Amy has worked in the social welfare field for 20 years+.  She has dedicated her career to helping others.  We have lived a happy normal everyday life as most others.    Amy has always been pro active with physicals, mammograms and lived a healthy lifestyle until one day last year, around April 2018 she started feeling rundown and had chest pains  We immediately saw doctors ruling out any heart issues however; the pains kept occurring and they continued to be no explanation for the high blood pressure and other symptoms. The next test was a colonoscopy and endoscopy.  During these procedures her blood pressure was in the 200s.  The Colonoscopy showed polyps.  She was diagnosed with an Esophageal ulcer as well as stomach ulcers. We were disappointed but relieved to have answers.  Her blood pressure remained high. After many more tests they finally ordered a 24 hour urine test to check her Cortisol hormone level, blood pressure, blood glucose and many other important bodily functions.  I believe normal range for  Cortisol  levels, for her age is about 10-20 micro grams per deciliter.  Amy's were pushing over 700!!  Doctors diagnosed her with a disease I had never heard of, Cushing's Syndrome.  We did a lot of research and Amy had so many of the horrible symptoms which included extremely high blood pressure, Cushing's related diabetes, low potassium levels, weight gain and the list goes on and on.  Cushing's is caused by overactive Adrenal gland located on Kidneys or Putatary gland.  I suggest Googling to learn more about this disease which many men and women suffer for years not knowing what's wrong with them. Moving forward she had a scan performed on kidney and to our horror there was a Cancerous tumor about 3 inches in size.  We were devastated to say the least.  We worked side by side with many doctors. She had surgery on November 1st, 2018.  After surgery we got more bad news as we learned part of tumor was on a critical Vascular vein and was to risky to try to remove.  While they were exploring other organs they found that her liver was compromised with  stage 4 cancer, a very aggressive and rare form of cancer called Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma or ACC. As you can imagine this was absolutely devastating to us for the second time.  We knew we had a long battle ahead of us with the Cushing's Sydrome alone, but didn't expect what was to come.  After a week at UCI Irvine California,  Amy was able to come home. She was feeling strong and ready to battle this.  We knew Chemotherapy was to come but with ACC Chemotherapy has little effect on this type of cancer, but we were ready.  At this time the  Cushing's symptoms escalated.  Everyday she has to take medication, including  blood thinners due to a Pulmonary Embolism she suffered on top of this due to Cushing's. She has to be on Insulin to treat the high blood sugar from Cushing's.  Her body has become a pin cushion with  so many daily labs, shots and tests.  Her stomach is one huge bruise from yet another side effect of Cushing's, where body easily bruises.  She is taking so many different prescriptions to keep all of her side effects in check and they just make her feel terrible everyday.  We are currently doing chemotherapy to battle the cancer on her kidney and lungs but due to yet another set back her liver levels and white cells dropped to a dangerous level and had to postpone chemotherapy again.  The Cushing's symptoms also cause setbacks, as also it affects her mobility, and can't left her self up & down on own, and  her feet become very swollen.Just a few short months ago my wife was active and living a normal life and now she cannot go upstairs and is basically confined to wheelchair and bed and needs assistance with what we take for granted.  Normal things like walking, standing, bathing and for someone who was active and self- reliant is absolutely devastating to her. Amy rarely complains about anything even though I know deep down she is so scared. I love my wife more than anything and my children who need their mother.  We will do whatever it takes to beat these horrible diseases.  We need everyone's help in any way possible, small or large, even a simple thought or prayer would be wonderful for this long journey ahead of us.  All donations will go directly towards medical expenses. We are now finding that we need to start home health care for her which is quite costly.  It takes a village and together we can make a difference.  We thank you from our hearts for your generosity and positive thoughts and much needed prayers.  Please share to as many friends or family.  Thank you again for taking the time to read this, we know it is a lot of information, but we wanted to make sure to provide with as much details as needed to understand the complex of this.    Please free to to reach out if you have any questions.Sincerely,Steve Fujikawa",55ff865f95ad41840ac93c63c3556319,50,0.5092,22.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

We first donated to the cause a few years ago. Through a contract with Baptist Children's Hospital, the CCCC was able to turn a  $3,000 donation into $12,000 worth of treatment for a family in need of help. ""During the past 51 years, no family has ever received a bill, and no child has ever been turned away"". The CCCC works with Baptist Hospital to not just treat children with cancer, but care for them.Our goal is to help in whatever way we can.

It's been eight years since my original colon cancer diagnosis; two years ago I was diagnosed as terminal. Cancer does not discriminate and while I have gone through many chemo and radiation treatments, along with other alternative treatments, I still continue to fight, but now in a different way: I have been placed on at home hospice care. I will no longer be doing treatments or possible surgeries. Unfortunately, my financial support for living and medical expenses have run out and I find myself once again having to rely on the generosity of others. My hope is that by sharing my journey transparently, you have been blessed in some way. For me, I have been tremendously blessed by the encouragement and support I have experienced by all of you. The added expenses of planning for a beautiful Celebration of Life is accutely upon me now; I could definitely use some help with that.It is with a humble heart that I reach out and ask for help, once again. I am thrilled with my ability and strength to fight, but the financial strain this has placed on me and my Three Little Birds is starting to take its toll. As I have progressed with my new Medicaid insurance in Nevada, I have found that the biggest issue with medical expenses are the prescriptions and drugs I must take. I have consistently been paying about $800 out of pocket, which causes my living expenses to take a huge hit. My goal with this GoFundMe is to save up money that I can save and draw from as I need it for living expenses, to plan for future Celebration of Life expenses, and (every once in awhile) be able to travel to see my daughter in Las Vegas as she embarks on her first year at UNLV and their nationally renowned debate team...health permitting.Basically, I need help. I want to spend as much time as I have left not worrying about money to live and to enjoy every second I have in this world.If you can give, I would appreciate it. If you cannot give but can pass this link along, it would be a huge help. As always, please follow my journey on Facebook by friending me at ""Emily Fay Reese "" and on Twitter at @mlereese . I love using my journey to help others be encouraged and to know that they are not alone.Thank you for caring for others. As I continue, I will keep fighting for health care and to save Medicaid, Social Security, and Medicare. Using my story to help others is a goal of mine while I can still do it, and by supporting me, you are also supporting others out there who cannot fight for themselves.Live Life, Love Life, Impact Others,Emily Fay Reese",beb7186a20586ce15123eb8e1b0db096,18,0.15572,180.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Kirsten’s colon cancer has become difficult to treat because of the specific mutations her cancer has adapted after 2.5 years of therapy. Standard of care treatment options are no longer effective. Kirsten is just 39: she and her husband John  have two teenage children who still need their mother. We are running out of optionsOver the past 2 years, Kirsten has spent hours upon hours trying to find clinical trials. At every turn, she’s run into heart-breaking roadblocks and has spent thousands of dollars traveling to top cancer centers in search of a clinical trial to save her life, only to be told that she doesn’t qualify.  Furthermore, the chemo treatments she is now battling through are not shrinking her tumors and she cannot do them forever due to cumulative toxic side effects. The amount of time, energy money and effort effort to sift through all the research, the treatment options (while going through brutal chemo treatments!)  and then even getting in contact with the people from the various clinical trials is nothing short of a herculean task. Until you go through cancer treatment to the point of considering clinical trials, you would think that a patient’s oncologist would have all the information and knowledge about these various clinical trials. They don’t and they cant. It’s almost impossible for one person to be up to speed on all of this. We’ve tried doing this on our own, and we now know that we need help.Kirsten recently connected with a start-up company, called Driver . Driver’s pioneering service will match her with treatment options at the most innovative cancer centers in the United States. They will evaluate her for treatments at each of these cancer centers and Driver’s team of experts will give her high-touch, personalized support along the way.  The largest barriers that Kirsten has faced while pursuing trial treatments on her own - evaluating the trial, getting in contact with them, seeing if she qualifies, getting records back and forth, setting appointments and evaluating the information - are all things that Driver’s team will help her with. We are launching this Go Fund me campaign to help cover the cost of the service from Driver.Please donate and share!Kirsten has been reluctant to ask for help until she absolutely needed it.  She is Butte-tough to the bone, but today, she needs your help! Please donate to this campaign, share it with everyone you know over social media, email, text message and phone calls.  Cancer is a tough SOB, but we are tougher.  I know, with the help of Driver, that we will find my sister a cure. My family and I are so grateful for your love and support and appreciate any contribution that you can make.About this CampaignThe funds from this GoFundMe campaign will go directly to Driver to pay for their service.

She has endured many painful rounds of chemotherapy and has underwent many surgeries which have included a complete hysterectomy, a double mastectomy, numerous spinal taps, bone marrow aspirations and removal of her right kidney. Lisa's cancer is unusual and unexpected, a very rare and aggressive form that many doctors have not seen. However, unfortunately, this cancer can find just about anyone and change the course of their life. Over the past 6.5 years, when Lisa's cancer first metastasized; thanks to her wonderful friends and family, she was able to raise enough money for medical bills. Now, Lisa needs your help again. Since January this year, Lisa's cancer markers have been rising, and recent scans show widespread metastatic disease in the brain, right lung, and intestines. Lisa is suiting up for battle once again, changing her protocol (with her oncologist and naturopathic doctors' help), and have already begun new, more aggressive treatments. The estimated cost for the rest of the 2017-2018 year (that is not covered by Lisa's Insurance) is $100,000 plus. While chemotherapy has been undeniably tough, she has the same positive attitude, strength, and determination to beat this disease, a feat equally as inspiring. Lisa asked Cody, her oldest nephew, what he wants for his birthday, and he said that he wants her ALIVE more than anything. Won't you please help Lisa give her nephew Cody the best birthday present ever? Please feel free to share this fundraiser widely with others who know Lisa, know you, or would support this cause. God has recently given The Basler family a little too much to deal with on their own. And anyone who knows Lisa and her family already know that if the roles were reversed, they would be the first ones to lend a helping hand. Would you consider donating to better Lisa's chances of survival??",cd170d74b0102c96875161afc20e49b9,18,0.3556666666666667,1170.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

She had lower abdominal pain all summer long, and just before going back to finish her final year at Covenant College in Georgia, she went for a check up at her gynocologist to check for orvarian cysts. During a laproscopic procedure the cancer was discovered. After meeting several oncologists, Hanna felt strongly that she needed to pursue a natural approach to dealing with the disease. She was able to enter into the care of some of the best alternative doctors available who felt confident they could help her. And so, over the past 6 months Hanna has pursued every avenue of homeopathic treatments, traveling to doctors around the tri-state area every day of the week, sometimes two in one day. We found out two weeks ago that the the tumors in Hanna's abdomen have grown from 3 CM to 17.5 CM - and have englufed her bladder, uterus, ovaries and affected part of her liver. It was made clear to her and my family that surgery is required immediately.WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:Hanna met with THE top surgeon for this type of cancer in Washington D.C. and he has an opening available to perform surgery this Thursday, March 8, 2018, before he takes a leave of absence. But, our insurance will only cover procedures within the state of New Jersey. We need to raise the funds to get this procedure done this week. We have no time to waste chasing down the insurance company. All donations will be put into the bank account of Hanna's mom - Hope, as she is sparing Hanna the financial burden as Hanna fights for her life. Throughout this entire experience, Hanna has remained steadfast and hopeful, which we credit to God and the immensely supportive community of friends and family who have come alongside her, prayed for her and sent notes of encouragement to Hanna. We recognize this is an incredible amount of money to try and raise in such a short amount of time, but her life depends on it. We believe that God is bigger than cancer, and that everything is possible through Him. So, we are hoping and believing for the impossible - and would be so grateful for anything you can do to help financially and by sharing this page.",a4772bb3dc4bb7abf0c49828c32c4170,16,0.898872,300.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I've been told I'm funny, sassy, good-natured, caring, empathetic, quick-witted, open-minded, carefree, loving and very appreciative of life. At the beginning of 2016, I was living a normal, productive life and so excited for the year ahead of me. I was celebrating such things like finishing my education, my nephew Marshall's 1st Birthday, and my Dad's offical retirement. These memorable occasions were definitely the finer moments in life. Little did I know that my life, my health, and my world were about to be flipped upside down.Many people ask me, how did this whole situation all begin? In January of this past year, I was having some digestive issues. At first, I thought it was just the typical growing pains, eating the wrong foods, or a stomach bug. After taking some over the counter medications that did not work, I decided to visit my Primary Care Physician who was concerned. He ordered a CT scan of my abdomen and the results had shown some sort of mass or tumor in my recto-sigmoid colon.  I was then referred to a Gastro-intestinal Doctor who had ordered a colonscopy. During the colonscopy, the GI doctor biopsied a part of the tumor. I will never forget those words ""You have stage 4 colorectal cancer"" on March 3rd, 2016. I was at my follow up appointment with the GI doctor with my Dad when I had heard those life-changing words. My Dad of all people. Let me explain...he had lost his Father, his Brother, and his Mom all within the past 2 years. He hid it well, but I'm sure this was the last thing he ever wanted to hear: now his oldest Son was sick. From this point forward, I began the most difficult journey I have ever been on.  I got to know my Oncologist, his staff, and Nurses very well. He said ""the next year of your life will be the most difficult., but we'll get through it."" I have had multiple CT Scans, multiple MRIs, mulitple PET scans, and many other procedures that aren't exactly comfortable. I also had a chemotherapy port installed under my right clavicle so that I wouldn't have to have my chemo injections done through my arm veins (for fear of collasping). My treatment plan since last March consisted of the following:1- Chemotherapy2- Radiation 3- Surgeries (There will be 2)4- Final ChemotherapyI am currently at step 3, and my first surgery is Friday, 12/2. This will be the most difficult and challenging of all the steps, both physically AND mentally.  After I am healed from the surgeries, I will then begin my last rounds of chemotherapy. Hopefully, when that is completed, I can be pronounced ""Cancer free"".My purpose of starting this GoFundMe account was to create awareness about my health through updates on my treatments and progress.  Regretfully, I will not be able to work for at least 2 months due to the nature of the first surgery and the recovery time involved. I am hoping by starting this account, it will help ease the financial burden by missing so much work. My goal is set to raise money that will assist me with my health and medical bills. We all know that even with insurance, healthcare costs can accumulate over time, especially with someone battling Cancer. After reading my GoFundMe page and you are considering donating, please remember that no donation is too small and anything is very much appreciated. I want to thank everyone in my life for their kindness, love and phenomenal support throughout my Cancer journey. The good in people really shines in someones' time of need. I am so blessed to have such amazing family, friends, and coworkers by my side. I especially want to thank my Partner Angelo, my Parents David and Janice, my Brother Matt and his wife Kayla, my niece Lexie and nephews Marshall and Graysen for being the best support system anyone could ask for!

I would like to share a small portion of it in hope that you can find it in your heart to help him during these trying times.  


In 2010 at the age of 24, Jacob was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He was living, volunteering, and teaching in Africa at the time and returned to the U.S.A. to recieve treatments at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City. After multiple surgeries over the course of a few months, including an RPLND which removed all of his lymph nodes throughout his entire abdomen, he was declared cancer free. He was left with astronomical medical bills, but he never once asked anyone for help. 


Jacob then went on to celebrate his remission by bicycling across the entire width of the U.S.A. Afterwards, he spent a few months learning how to build eco-friendy earthen homes and took this newly found skill back to Africa where he helped many rural families and communities to build affordable shelters. 


After returning home from Africa, Jacob fostered his passion to keep helping people by deciding to enroll back in school to become a nurse. He remembered how much of an important role the nurses played in his recovery and he wanted to have that impact on other people's lives as well.  


Along with being a full time nursing student at Rutgers University, he still found time to give back to other cancer patients and the staff at Memorial Sloan Kettering by volunteering to be a guest speaker and conselor to both new incoming hires and patients. 


Unfortunately, with only two semester left into finishing his goal, Jacob felt two lumps in his throat and his battle with cancer began again. 


After 7 years of remission, Jacob was diagnosed with testicular cancer once again. This time his cancer has aggressively returned and has spread throughout his body in multiple locations. This has left him in a 'high-risk' category and his treatment will be very difficult. 


Jacob will be undergoing 4 rounds of chemotherapy that includes 5 days of 5.5 hours of chemotherapy followed by 16 days off per cycle. If the chemotherapy responds well, he will then have to have multiple major surgeries to cut out the remaining cancer after a few months later. During this entire time he will not be able to work and his student financial aid loans have also been stripped away from him. This has left him with previous medical bills and zero financial support at this time. 


Jacob is such a prideful person that he would never ask for money, but as his brother, I am reaching out to the world to ask for any small donation that you could offer to help him during these times. I ask that if you cannot give yourself that you at least share his powerful story.  


My brother is an incredible man and there is so much more to his story that can't be written in such a small space. I ask that you support him during these times and know that any donation will be going towards a man who has spent his entire life giving to those who have needed it and is pledging to do so again as a nurse once healed. 


Thank you and I wish you all nothing but love, peace, and good fortune.",7259969d3d59ee8983b3181992261ae9,24,1.7310666666666668,450.0,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

WE NEED YOU NOW!

It is with a massively heavy heart that I have to tell you that this beautiful little beacon of love & of light has been dealt an incredibly cruel blow.


Last week, Jack was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. (High Risk Neuroblastoma).


For the past week, I have struggled to find the words to describe this, and every time i think i can, the words just get stuck in my throat. In the end, I have had to concede that there are simply no words; none at all.


Over the next several months, Jack will need multiple rounds of Chemotherapy, Immunotherapy, Two Bone Marrow Transplants and Radiation Therapy. And that is what we know right now. 


TWO WAYS THAT YOU CAN HELP:

1. DONATE - 
As much or as little as you can - It will all help and it all matters to Jack! 


""All"" funds will be used to offset any treatment costs not covered by medical insurance and to help Jack and his family manage additional financial concerns such as ancilliary bills/expenses related to his care and potential loss of income while he is being cared for. 


100% of any funds left over will be donated to a child cancer (Neuroblastoma) charity - to continue the fight for other children.


2. GO VIRAL!

Share this page with as many people as you can! 


By ""Going Viral"", you will radically increase the odds of Jack getting the help that he needs. There are many good people out there that may care enough to help - we just have to let them know that they can - and that it will make a difference! 


Go ahead - Spread the word!


MY THOUGHTS:

While our world has been so harshly upended, I will also tell you that I believe, in my bones & in my heart, that we will get through this...that ""he"" will get through this.


I will also tell you, that while Jack's life has suddenly become a life of hospitals & of change, that he has demonstrated resilience, courage & a tolerance for his situation that most likely, you or I could not.


The road ahead will be long. The fight ahead will be very hard; fraught with danger and with challenge. But I earnestly believe, that with an optimistic heart, that with kindness, prayers and community, and above all, with an ""indomitable"" will to win, that we will get through this...that ""he"" will succeed!


MY APPEAL:

As friends & as ""Jack-Fan's"", I ask each of you to join us and to help Jack in the coming weeks & months ahead. With your faith, by supporting us however you can & by sharing in our ""indomitable will"" to win!


Together, let's keep this beautiful little light shining strong for all to see!


Thank you so very much! ❤

Because it is so rare, there is minimal research or treatments for it. The government and pharmaceutical companies have no interest in investing their time or money for a rare disease, since there is no financial gain in it for them. This clearly makes my family and I feel abandoned. Despite these feelings, I refuse to let them cripple me. I have learned to advocate for myself and I will fight vigorously to live the long life I deserve.   I will fight for others who are diagnosed with this awful disease to have more options. Luckily there is a team of doctors at the University of Michigan that is lead by the amazing Dr. Gary Hammer, who have been researching cures for Adrenal Carcinoma to help people like myself. For my birthday on November 20th, there is no better birthday present than for my friends and family to help me raise money to present to Dr. Hammer when I go meet with him on December 11th for my next appointment. I believe this man will save my life and others like me, but he can’t do it alone. Here is a link to learn more about this rare disease and what Dr. Hammer and his team are doing to find a cure.

Violet is fighting Stage 3 Cancer.   It started a long time ago. Violet was going from doctor to doctor and Jaime was variably told that her daughter had a virus; that a 105.9 fever was nothing to worry about; that she had tummy troubles; that some kids just vomit when they smell things; that she was constipated; and, that a large lump on her side was just some poop stuck in her bowels. She was told to just give Violet some Magnesium.Jaime had brought Violet to several doctors over the years. It made no sense to any of us that an active child, who ate an incredibly healthy and mostly sugar-free diet should appear to carry so much belly fat (which turned out to be a tumor). The doctors, one after the other, dismissed the very tangible lump on her side, insisting it was stool despite Jaime's protestations that the child was not constipated. When Violet developed rashes, they were dismissed as allergies. Unexplained fevers were met with instructions to take Tylenol. Vomiting after meals was attributed to eating dairy. When Jaime insisted that extensive bloodwork be done, inflammatory markers were off the charts. Still, Jaime was told that this was nothing to worry about and it was just something she had eaten and the yet undiagnosed food allergy. Although the vomiting stopped, the random fever spikes worsened; Jaime insisted that Violet be seen by the head of the pediatric practice. That doctor sent Violet to the ER.   Things progressed quickly...Violet has just undergone surgery to remove a kidney and a massive watermelon sized tumor that had taken over her entire abdomen. When she awoke from the surgery, she signed, ""I love you"" and fell back to sleep. A couple of days later, she announced, ""I have never felt so good!"" Unfortunately, that feeling was short lived as she has just begun chemo therapy and radiation. The treatments are aggressive and Violet is scared, but she has been incredibly brave throughout the last couple of weeks. She knows she will experience side effects such as nausea and that she will lose all her hair. She spent New Year's Day vomiting from the side effects of her first day of Chemo.  Violet is preparing for six-months of treatment, and then recovery from the tolls of her treatment. During this time, she will be immuno-suppressed and isolated to avoid contracting any illness that might interfere with her treatment. Jaime will have to leave her job to provide Violet with the constant care she deserves and will need. Jaime is a single-mom, who has always found time to help her friends and family. Now she needs our help. We can continue to give her emotional support and all the time we can afford away from our own families and jobs. We can assist with preparing meals that cater to Violet's current needs, and run errands. But, what Jaime will need most in the year to come is financial support to cover her monthly expenses while she remains at home caring for Violet. So, we created this Go Fund Me page to help Jaime. Your support is very much appreciated and will alleviate some of the stress Jaime faces in the year to come.

On April 28, 2017, Tim Groller, his family and friends were devastated upon learning some shocking news. Tim was diagnosed with Stage 4, Non-Small cell lung cancer.  ~Son~Brother~Friend~Officer~Father~ To sum up 1 Amazing man with 5 simple words is not an easy feat but I’ll try my best. Tim Groller, only 34 years old, is the oldest son of Tim and Lenore Groller and the brother of Jason Groller. Tim was born and raised in Easton Pa, he grew up on the wrestling mat and spent many weekends participating in Tournaments in and around Pennsylvania. Tim’s Senior year of high school was spent as member of the Easton High School Wrestling Team. The RED ROVERS rose to Greatness that year, winning the State Wrestling Championship in 2001. He went on to graduate from Bloomsburg University in 2005 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Criminal Justice. With a desire to serve, Tim applied to and was hired at the Carlisle Police Department in July of 2007. Tim’s natural leadership abilities, intelligence and keen sense of justice, allowed him to rise through the ranks within the department quickly. In 2012, he was promoted to Corporal. His desire to lead from the front afforded Tim a coveted position within the elite Cumberland County Special Response Team from 2009-2015. During this time, Tim was also a Trainer for his fellow Brothers and Sisters within the Police Department. While Tim’s career was taking off, so was his personal life. He met a beautiful woman, Gabrielle, who would soon steal his heart and become the mother of their first child, a beautiful daughter they christened, Ava, in 2010. They married in front of all of their beloved family and friends in August of 2011. In April of 2012 they welcomed their second Baby Girl, Ella, a fiery redhead. Finally, after much deliberation, Tim and Gabrielle decided to have one more baby. On April 10, 2017, Timothy Paul was born and their family was now complete. This is where Tim’s life takes a dramatic downturn. On April 23, 2017, Tim was taken to the ER for severe pain initially thought to be related to appendicitis or kidney stones. Blood tests led to X-Rays. X-Rays led to Cat-Scans. Cat-Scans revealed tumors. The tumors were found on Tim’s lung, liver, spine, sternum and rib. On April 28, 2017, the final diagnoses was worse than what all who know and love Tim could have ever anticipated, he has Stage 4, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. As anyone who knows Tim can tell you, his Can-Do spirit and Warrior Mentality came roaring to the surface. His treatments will take him to U of Penn in Philadelphia. His treatments, although covered by insurance will still be costly. Travel expenses, food, and unforeseen expenses will add up quickly. On behalf of the Groller Family and his many friends, I am asking for donations to make the expenses anticipated during Tim’s epic battle, be the least of his worries.

This is the story of our beautiful little girl Gabriella. October 1st 2017. It was the day that changed our lives forever. It was a beautiful fall Sunday morning and there she was: running around and playing as all three year olds do. We had to calm her down to get her dressed and ready for the day, when we felt a concrete like lump on her abdomen. We didn’t really know what to make of it since she showed no sign of discomfort or pain. We thought it would be best to take her down to urgent care to get checked out as it was Sunday and her pediatrician was closed. We took her there thinking they would just tell us it’s a milk allergy or a bad case of constipation. An X-ray of her stomach showed a large mass but they couldn’t really tell what it was for sure. They wanted to do a CT scan on her stomach to further tell what it could possibly be. After we took her in for the scan, we went back to the room and waited for the results. What seemed like hours had passed when the doctor working that day came in and told us what she believed it was. She told us it looks like a massive tumor and we needed to go to Boston Childrens Hospital IMMEDIATELY. Our hearts sank. We were overcome with confusion and fear. Without hesitation, we rushed her to the emergency room at Children’s and they took her back right away. What came next was a barrage of testing and scans. They needed to draw blood. They needed urine samples. They needed to do an MRI and another CT scan. By this time it was close to 10 pm when the doctor came in and told us they sent all of the images and blood work over to Dana Farber and a couple of oncologists were on their way to speak with us. They sat down with us and confirmed every parents worst fear. It was a 3 pound tumor growing off her adrenal gland. Neuroblastoma. Cancer. They would be scheduling surgery immediately.To say that Gabriella has been through a tough time is an understatement. At a time when most young kids are enjoying school, playing outside, spending time with family, Gabriella has spent the better part of a year in the hospital for a major surgery, two bone marrow aspirations, and countless doctors visits for checkups, blood tests and urine tests. She also has an MIBG bone scan and injection every 3-6 weeks. We thought she was in the clear as we approached the one year mark of her diagnosis, the doctors noticed a small mass on a routine ultrasound. Her catacholmine levels have started rising above the normal levels. She has her next MIBG scan and bone marrow aspiration in a few weeks, and we are praying that our worst fears won’t be confirmed again. There’s a quote that reads “when someone has cancer the whole family has cancer” and that couldn’t be any more true. Yet we remain as positive as possible. Gabriella will need follow up medical care for the foreseeable future. We already have mounting medical bills from the life saving treatment she has received and continues to receive from Children’s and the Jimmy Fund Clinic at Dana Farber. No child should have to endure what Gabby has. She has shown us what true strength is. She in the fight for her life and continues to amaze us with her sense of humor and her ability to laugh and smile during every one of her pokes and procedures.Any money raised from this Gofundme will be used to pay for further treatment and ongoing expenses related to Gabriella’s fight against this horrible disease.

To family and friends, Summer is the light of our lives. She is a character. She is smart, funny, caring, always happy. She is so much like her mother April, with her big blue eyes and a laugh that makes everyone smile. Like her dad Clint, she loves fishing, nature, the outdoors. I write this with a heavy heart that my niece has a long journey ahead of her.  Throughout last year, my sister April expressed strong concerns to several GPs and hospitals of Summers ongoing health issues. April ensured to receive second and third medical opinions as her intuition was telling her something was wrong. Each visit, Summer was overlooked and misdiagnosed for weight loss, snoring/sleep apnoeas, dyspnoea, and altered speech. On the 20th of December, Summer was transferred from Sunshine Coast University Hospital to Lady Cilento QLD Children's Hospital by ambulance and placed in an induced coma in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit for 6 days in a critical but stable condition. During this time, we received the devastating news that Summer has  a rare form of childhood cancer.  Summer awoke from her coma on Boxing Day and the Oncology Services Group began chemotherapy immediately. She is currently undertaking this intensive protocol chemotherapy treatments on a weekly basis that is expected to last approximately 12 months. Thereafter, she will be in remission for 2 years. As Summer progresses through treatment, she may experience a series of side effects associated with treatments including: nausea, vomiting, constipation, alopecia, increased risk of infections due to suppressed immune system functioning, weakness and muscle deterioration. Summer's care needs will escalate above the care needs of a child her age. She will require extensive support with daily activities such as showering, walking and dressing. These side effects are expected to worsen over the coming months as her treatment intensifies. Summer will need specialised care for the entirety of her treatment. This is a full-time responsibility that April will be required to prioritise. April will be unable to return to work or continue her educational studies. The next 12 months, Summer will be reliant on receiving her nutrients via a nasograstric (NG) tube attached to a feeding bag. Radiaotherapy will also commence some time during this year.  It has been confirmed that Summer will suffer from infertility. We have created a Gofundme page to raise awareness, and if you feel that you would like to share your support in whatever way possible, please feel free to do so. Her diagnosis was unexpected and this treatment will strain the family finances significantly. As I am sure you can understand, this is a very difficult time for April, Clint and both families as we adjust to Summer's diagnosis and support her through treatment. Funds raised will go towards living expenses (accommodation, transport, food, parking etc), medical costs (medicine, NG feeding material, syringes, port-a-cath patches etc) and general support costs for Summer's fight against cancer.  Other ways that you can support are through giving blood via the Australian Red Cross Foundation  https://www.donateblood.com.au. Food vouchers, fuel vouchers, in-home support services, early learning programs and experiences for Summer will all help contribute to her healing and recovery. April's sisters Natalie, Gemma and I will be hosting a fundraising event called ""Sounds for Summer"" filled with music, markets and prizes.

In July 2016, at the age of 28 he was diagnosed with stage three colon/rectal cancer . He has been in and out of hospitals from October 2016 to September 2017 following the traditional route of chemotherapy, radiation and colostomy .We thought the worst was behind us as TJ was adjusting to his new life with a permanent ostomy bag,when we were dealt a heavy blow this Christmas. Suffering from unbearable pain, he was rushed to the Hospital and 2 surgeries later, his doctors confirmed our worst fears...his cancer had returned.Radiation is no longer an option as TJ has been given his lifetime quota of radiation. Also, his chemotherapy options are very limited, too limited to give us a good prognosis. Doctors have recommended surgery, however it has not been approved by the insurance and TJ is very weak. This 4th major surgery is going to be very difficult on his body, especially since he's done 3 major surgeries in less than 12 months.  The recovery period has become very difficult and painful for him with no guarantees of success.We have however, been handed a lifeline through an alternative therapy option called ""Ozone Therapy"" and believe it's our best chance at saving TJ's life. In addition to being a natural alternative to eradicate cancer, TJ will be educated on how to follow a healthy diet to maximize his chances at a cancer free life. The ""Ozone Therapy"" will be 3 times per week over an 8 month period and is geared towards creating a hostile environment within the body that makes it impossible for cancer cells to survive. The total cost of therapy, special diet, minerals and supplements will be $34,000 which unfortunately TJ's insurance company will not cover either.We believe that this is our brother's best chance of beating his cancer and we ask for your support in reaching our Goal.Nicholas and Alicia",efa7189919661077ff3c86da3d198d4b,14,1.0074117647058825,330.0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0.0026109660574412533,0.0,0.9580188679245283,2.76582813998647,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

In fact, it is said that you can feel her wonderful energy before she even enters the room.  Her heart truly made of love, without a spec of hate. Summer has always been the type to give, give, give. She's never asked even when she's the one in need. August 2017, is when Summer started to feel symptoms such as pain in her left upper leg. With being an athlete in the past years, she stated that it was as tense as a charley horse,  but she had no idea why this type of pain would come back with no type of physical activity. The pain in her leg continues to get progressively worse over the next three months. November 2017, Summers leg gives out as she carrying her baby, and the pain that once felt like a charley horse has now gotten worse and is now unbearable. Summer decides to go to the Emergency Room. They diagnosed her with sciatic nerve pain, suggested that she get a MRI, and sends her home with pain medication. She gets a MRI, and starts to see a chiropractor for her ""sciatic nerve pain"".   The pain continues to get worse, now making it hard for her to play with her son, or continue physical activity as she wishes. She ends up in the ER numerous times because the chiropractor and medication that was prescribed is not helping at all. June 2018, Summer decides to move back to Arizona hoping to get a better answer for the uncontrollable pain. Summer goes to the ER in Arizona with her mom, where they referred her to a Sport Medicine Doctor. This new Dr diagnoses her with IT Band Syndrome. This leads Summer to start physical therapy. After two weeks of physical therapy, the pain has not subsided and is constantly keeping summer up all night.

This leads to extra test because of the shocking x ray results.On December 31, 2018, Summer Brown is diagnosed with Stage lymphoma.

We became more than close friends, he is my brother. I know him to be an incredible man with a huge heart. He is a family man, a man of the community, a wonderful father, husband, son, and friend. His loyalty and character are undeniable. Always genuine and kind, he has always put the needs of others in front of his own. He is a hard worker who maintains a positive attitude and never complains or asks for help. Many of his friends don’t even know what he has gone through over the past several years and I want to share it now. ASH’S FIGHTAsh was always very health conscious. He was a regular to the gym who followed a healthy diet and life. In November 2011 he was in peak physical condition when he developed a virus which was diagnosed as the mumps. Unlike any virus he ever had, it lingered for about 6 weeks inflaming his immune system. He developed swollen lymph nodes all over his head and neck. Although the virus subsided, he constantly felt lethargic and significantly weak. Follow ups with his doctor resulted in being told he was just getting older. After beginning to vomit on a daily basis, he visited doctors again who felt it was just stress and nervousness. He and his wife, Amani were expecting the birth of their second child. By spring of 2012 Ash had lost over 20lbs. In June 2012 he noticed sagging on the right side of his cheek which developed into a gum ball sized lump. After getting checked out again, he was told it was possibly a submandibular tooth infection and put on another course of antibiotics.  In July 2012, just a month away from the birth of his beautiful daughter Sara, Ash woke to a lump in the back of his neck and incredible pain. His doctor immediately scheduled him to see an ENT specialist. Ash missed that appointment which coincided with the birth of his daughter, but Ash’s sister, a radiologist who came to visit their newborn in September immediately took him to the Cleveland Clinic. Just one month after the birth of Sara, Ash was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma. Further testing revealed him to be Stage 3s Hodgkins Lymphoma. A regimen of ABVD Chemo Therapy began November 2012. The doctors and data indicated Hodgkins to be a “good” cancer, with approximately an 85% cure rate. Having completed his regimen in March 2013, Ash rang the cancer bell at the Cleveland Clinic believing he had beat his cancer. A year and a half later, in October 2014, a fear that always lingers was realized. A CT Scan confirmed that a few lymph nodes were enlarged again and needed further treatment. This relapse threw out all the “good cancer” thoughts and cure percentages. The next course of treatment would involve ICE Chemo Therapy treatment for 3 months followed by scanning for progress and then an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant. Basically, completely nuking him with chemo for 10 days and attempting to restart his immune system with the transplant. March 11, 2015 was Ash’s new “birthday” with his transplant. He slowly recovered and made it out in time for his son’s birthday March 22nd. This time, the road to recovery lasted much longer. He didn’t begin to feel like himself until around January 2016. Although Ash was frightened with each scan he took, his remission lasted much longer. Confidence growing, Ash celebrated his three year clean transplant date on March 11, 2018. This three year mark is a very important one, indicating high probability that the cancer has been beat. Once again Ash’s hopes and outlook were very high.In June 2018, Ash felt a hernia in his abdomen. Testing confirmed not only the hernia, but also some enlarged lymph nodes on his left Iliac region. An Imaging Guided Biopsy of the Retroperitoneal Lymph Node was inconclusive, so Ash had to wait a few months for another CT scan. This revealed another enlarged lymph node near his spleen. They were able to biopsy this node and on October 5, 2018 Ash learned the results of his second relapse. Going forward, Ash is currently undergoing GDP Chemo. This will last for two to three months depending on his progress. Afterward, he will be hospitalized for 6-10 days of salvage chemo and an Allogenic Transplant. He will be closely monitored for host vs. graft disease and be administered major anti-rejection meds to suppress his own immune system. ASH’S SITUATIONAs I mentioned earlier, Ash has always been a hard worker. He and Amani had great jobs, insurance, and savings. This seven year (and counting) fight has stripped them of all of that and more. Even with his family’s support, they are in a dire situation. They need help. HOW YOU CAN HELP ASH:SHARE HIS STORY: This is perhaps the most impactful thing that you can do for Ash! The more people who know about this wonderful man and his fight the better.

Sweat drops under her eyes. you could take a towel dry her off and when you were finished with that first swipe, she was wet all over again.)  not only did Bridgette have the sweating to deal with but she started sleeping a lot losing her appetite. Bridgette went from being over weight to dropping pounds on the scale. Only when the dr weighed her, you saw she didn't lose anything.  :( We had to start buying smaller diapers and getting out her smaller clothes.  She started getting dark circles under her eyes. Her belly started to bulge. she started eating again in BIG portions like she was starving but never gained a pound or showed it. I then made a appointment with Bridgette 's dr they ordered to have some lab work done, little did we realize what a long tough road Bridgette had I front of her.  She went threw blood work lot of blood. she had a ultra sound, allergy tests, parasites, all kinds of testing for a whole year! Still no answers and we were no closer to finding out what was wrong with Bridgette.  But Bridgette has developed a huge fear of the doctors. As a parent and trying to find out what is wrong with your child and seeing nothing being found, when as a parent do you say enough is enough? Well for me it was time, my husband and I made the choice to bring Bridgette 3 hours away from home to Boston Children's hospital. Knowing this was going to be a hard trip ahead. We packed our things with high hopes to find out once and for all what was wrong with Bridgette .When we got there she needed lots of blood work again and this didn't make poor Bridgette happy. She shakes cries and so scared I have never seen such a fear of doctors as she is. Then came the MRI of her brain, that was cleared but they did find abnormal test on Bridgette, she has a thyroid problem they found. Then more abnormal test made them find more. We still are not sure exactly what is wrong with Bridgette.  But they told us she needs to be tested for a cancerous tumor. New MRI,pet scans, lab work and ultra sounds. We are in a bind all these medical expenses have brought us to a painful halt.  The thing about Bridgette is she is a rare kid event tho she is very sick and she is still so happy and sweet.

My mother Aricia Caivano (49) was diagnosed with myeloid dysplasia syndrome in 2013. Although she was on an ongoing chemo regimen, her MDS progressed into acute myeloid leukemia in September of 2017. It was then that her doctors began searching for a bone marrow donor. She, my brother and I then all got matching mohawks. Her oncology team at the hospital at the University of Pennsylvania then began a more aggressive round of chemo. At this point, she was admitted to the hospital where she would receive daily blood and irradiated platelet transfusions. In October of 2017, my mom developed a brain bleed, and woke up to find herself in the neurological department of the Intensive Care Unit without the ability to talk. Her speech finally returned a number of rest-filled days later. After her first round of aggressive chemo she was allowed to return home for the week of Christmas 2017. Before the new year rolled in, she was back in a hospital bed for chemo round 2.  With the onset of February, she contracted CDIF (clostridium difficile colitis) while in the hospital. CDIF is a highly contagious bacterial infection that spreads rampantly throughout hospitals killing roughly 14,000 people annually. not only was the CDIF torture, but an infected host stays contagious for the rest of their life. For this reason, although her immune system has since recovered, she remains in a state of quarantine to this day.  Months had gone by, and no marrow donor had been found. She was out of time. She was treated with full body radiation to kill all of her bone marrow, cancerous or otherwise. Thereafter On April 20th 2018, stem cells from the umbilical cords of two little girls were transplanted instead of bone marrow. Her rainbow Mohawk finally fell out.  Things were starting to look up for the cancer free 4'11"" ball of faulty blood cells. Her blood cell counts were recovering steadily, then came a startling realization. She jumped out of the frying pan, straight into the fire. Aricia's body began rejecting the stem cells, causing GVHD (Graft vs. Host Disease) in her skin. This disease manifested as a dark red raised rash. To combat the GVHD, she was started on a constant stream of the steroid Prednisone. While subduing the rash, it went on to cause a plethora of side effects. These side effects include a few heavy hitters like diabetes, scoliosis, osteoporosis, and severe edema. Before leaving the hospital one long month after the transplant, her bones had deteriorated so much that she can no longer stand up straight and three compression fractures developed in her spine simply from lying in a hospital bed. Countless doctor's appointments, and numerous hospitalizations later, October came. My brother Nicholas was marrying his number one gal, and my mom couldn't be more excited to attend the wedding. At this time she was in a rehabilitation facility coming off of a long stint in the hospital once again. She was hitting the physical therapy with everything she had in her, but she wouldn't be able to dance with her eldest son at his wedding, or even make an entrance without someone pushing her wheelchair.   At present day, my mom is back in the hospital in Philadelphia on a ventilator.  I've put my personal life and professional life on hold to be full time care taker of my mother, driving her to doctors appointments, hospitals, making sure her meds are giving in proper doses, and speaking on her behalf when she is out of it on so many pain killers.  In addition to all this responsibility, I have also taken over my mom's role of full time caregiver to her mother, my mom-mom Minako who has Alzheimer's disease.  I visit her daily to cook her meals, help her with day to day tasks and make sure her home is filled with essentials.  These jobs are passionate and exhausting for me.  Yesterday I found out my mother's cobra insurance has been terminated. I'm very nervous because my mother's disease has put her into hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt in medical bills and now its really going to begin to get beyond overwhelming. I need help and support.  I feel helpless but I am feeling better already creating this gofundme page. I am really hoping that the kindness of the world will help us prevail.  If you have been through a battle with cancer and you can relate to the struggle please share this story.  If you have been a caregiver please share this story.  taking care of families takes a village.  if this story touched you in any way please share it.  Any donation is welcome & will be so greatly appreciated. No donation is too small.       More photos coming soon.",00556158b7cce0f9210a61e1c6b756c1,52,0.0232,6.0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Unfortunately, after a year of chemotherapy and 33 rounds of radiation, it spread to her bones and she was diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer.Within 6 years she has gone through non-stop series of complicated and traumatic treatments, tests and procedures, such as double mastectomy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal treatment, biopsies, PET scans, MRIs, multiple ER visits, which have often left her in excruciating pain, absolute despair, and overwhelming fear.  In 2017, she suddenly started to feel much worse as it turned out that metastases spread to her liver and their amount increased in her bones and spine. In October 2017, she had a serious fracture in her right arm because her bones were weakened by metastases. She had to undergo a surgery to install a metal rod into the bone of her right arm. The surgery lasted 5 hours and anesthesia caused significant complications, so that Lyubov had to spend a week in ICU.  Her arm still doesn't function properly.In December 2017, she went through 10 sessions of radiation of tumors in her spine, left leg and right arm. It caused severe side effects: extreme weakness, vomiting and rapid weight loss. In February 2018, she underwent another surgery to insert a metal rod into her right leg and left arm. This was done preventatively, to avoid another fracture. At the moment, she is undergoing intensive chemotherapy. Lyubov is having very hard time walking because a spine tumor pushes a nerve and causes severe pain while moving around. She needs to do another round of spine radiation. Almost every day she has doctor appointments and treatment procedures. Her husband is the only one working in their family and he often has to take her to appointments during his work hours. He is not able to make enough money to pay the bills and keep the family afloat. He cannot work full time because he also has to be her only caregiver.Despite all of Lyubov's extreme health challenges and life hardships, she is fighting cancer in order to be with her 11-year-old daughter, Eva and is staying optimistic that she will prevail and go into remission. The young girl needs her mom and she is very scared of losing her. They don't have anyone else to help financially. Luba's parents died from cancer not long before she was diagnosed herself. The only hope is generosity of caring people around them. At the moment, we are collecting money for alternative treatment to boost Lyubov’s immune system, recovery after chemotherapy and radiation and hopefully a stay in one of alternative clinics for further treatment.",c856ef41b34e41af364e071f78778b29,22,0.39016,240.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I've called all of you here to help me help one of our own, Judy Lendsey Snyder, as she continues, along with her new husband Dane, to fight the big fight and ""Kick Cancer's Ass!"" Sadly Judy has been down this road twice before and has always found a way to come out shining. She is extremely tuned in to her body and what works and what does not. Unfortunately the insurance companies do not agree nor are they willing to pay for any type of treatment that they don't deem standard. As I said she's been there and knows first hand what works for her however that isn't enough to have it funded by insurance. So many of you have been generously helping on another Go Fund Me page set up to help and as of today she is more than a quarter of the way to her goal of $40,000 which will allow her to have the treatments in the manner both she and her doctors know is right for her. This brings me to the light bulb above my head. I have a WIN-WIN-WIN idea thats nothing but positive for all involved. What is the ""Tie That Binds"" us all together? Bruce, of course! I wonder if he knows just how much his music and our love for all things E Street has strengthened all of us at one point or another. He continues to give in so many different ways always reinventing himself and sharing it with us. What if we could thank Bruce & help Judy at the very same time? Interested? As so many of you know I have started a business called Audrey Hunn Designs. I make personalized photo gifts that are as individual and special as the recipient they're for. With that said I am donating my time, my art & the cost of making Bruce a ""Thank You/Birthday"" blanket for his upcoming birthday which also just happens to be right before the start of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The blanket will consist of pictures of Bruce & his fans from all different periods of his career. If you've had the good fortune to meet Bruce at any point whether it be at a book signing, outside the Broadway show, on the street, in an airport or maybe even on stage with him I want your photo to be a part of the blanket. A $25 donation will get your photo on a small square.  A $50 donation will get it on a larger square. Last but certainly not least a $100 donation will get you the largest sized square and you can also send me a personal birthday card for Bruce that will accompany all of this along with a description of this project and how our love of all things E Street has helped yet another one of our own. I will furnish those with my mailing address later to send a card. What I can promise is delivery of the blanket.  Anyone who knows me knows when I set out to do something I don't rest until its done! Every single dollar raised through this project will go directly to Judy and her fight to get healthy. I have set up this Go Fund Me page, which is different from the other set up by a friend of hers a while back.  This is just for the blanket project and I know so many of you have so generously donated prior to this project but this is the only donation location that is connected to the blanket. After donating please email me your picture along with your name to aud425@comcast.net and put ""Bruce Blanket"" in the subject line. Please do not post your picture you'd like to use here unless you email it as well. The deadline to get your picture in is SEPTEMBER 1st!

She finally went to the Emergency Room on the third day of pain.  She was sent down for a Cat Scan thinking maybe it was a kidney stone. It ended up being a tumor the close to the size of a football on her right ovary. The following Monday she followed up with her Doctors office and was told that her blood work had come back. Her CA-125 was 509, normal range is 0-35. She then went to see Dr. Michelin at the Cowell Cancer Center at Munson Hospital in Traverse City. He’s a Gynecologic Oncologist and one of the best Ovarian Cancer Surgeons. He wanted to get the surgery scheduled the next day, but due to scheduling the earliest Bren could get in was October 29th. He did not want to wait even longer for a biopsy to come back so he scheduled the surgery to remove the tumor and also do a full hysterectomy. He was confident he could get the cancer and put in a chemotherapy port if needed at the time of surgery.Bren had the surgery and it ended up being a rare Appendix Cancer in later stages and it had metastasized to the ovary. This is a rare form of cancer and only see 1000 cases a year in the United States.  The Surgeon removed the appendix, the tumor and did the full hysterectomy. Unfortunately this type of Appendix cancer, called Mucinous CystadenocarcinomaTumors produce a jelly like substance that cannot be removed with a scalpel. So several biopsies were taken and Bren is going down to a hospital in Detroit to see  an  Oncologist surgeon who specializes in Appendix Cancer. In November the new surgeon is going to do a fairly new chemotherapy and surgery on Bren. Since it’s an advanced -stage appendix cancer, liquid chemo for gel like Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) will be done.  If the biopsies show the cancer has metastasized even further, he will remove those cancer tumors and begin administering the heated, sterilized chemotherapy solution . It is delivered to the abdomen to penetrate and destroy remaining cancer cells. The solution is 41 to 42 degrees Celsius, about the temperature of a warm bath. It’s circulated throughout the abdomen for approximately 1 ½ hours. The solution is then drained from the abdomen and the incision is closed.  This will destroy the cancer cells in the stomach and stomach lining.We are all trying to stay positive and praying for Brenda and her two young sons.  This is going to affect Brenda and her sons, emotionally, physically and financially. She will be out of work to recover after these surgeries and it is unknown at this time what other treatments along with chemo therapy she will have. Brenda is a single Mom to two boys and is worried about them and how they will handle this. She is staying strong for them and is going to stay positive and beat this.If you can please. consider donating to Brenda, so she can concentrate on her cancer treatments, healing and time with her boys instead of stressing about living expenses.Above all, I’m asking for prayers for Brenda, her sons and family during this difficult time.I wil keep everyone updated as Bren goes through her surgery and treatments.Please share this with family and friends.Thank you,Arrielle MonroeBrenda went to see Dr. Michelin on November 13 and found that her Appendix Cancer Is stage four! The   pathology report showed That as we know the cancer Started in the appendix and went to the ovaries Fallopian tubes cervix and uterus. As you know Brenda had a full hysterectomy and now he is have to deal with the cancer tumors that were jelly like and the surgeon could not get. She will be seeing Dr. Richard Berri at St. John’s Providence Hospital in Grosse Point Michigan.  After her consultation she will be hopefully going forward to do the HIPEC Procedure as soon as possible.  Brenda has a long  road of treatments and healing ahead of her.

When going to the doctor, she was told it was just tendinitis and given inflammatory's and that it would resolve itself. After a month of on going pain, she returned to the doctor and was now told it was a torn bicep tendon and was recommended to physio therapy. Juliana did the therapy for a while and found no results. She went back and was referred to Ajax shoulder center, and was told now that it was a frozen shoulder. They administered cortisone shots and informed her that the frozen shoulder would resolve itself. Juliana then continued to try alternatives at home such as, acupuncture, heating pads, ice packs, stretching, tiger balm and voltern and still found no results.  After 9 months of pain a friend referred Juliana to another physio therapist who upon seeing her right away sent her to the hospital and scans done. Once Juliana did the tests, she was informed by the doctors that she had Osteosarcoma. Which is an aggressive bone cancer, which had metastasized (spread) to the lungs. Due to being misdiagnosed for several months, several times. The doctors informed Juliana that the cancer was incurable and inoperable. Juliana was given a 30% chance to live , which is 3-5 years. Juliana was put on chemo therapy right away, and did 2 sessions. With no results, the doctors advised her the chemo therapy was not working. Juliana has no chosen to try an alternative route. She has started O-Zone therapy which has costed her $5000 in just blood tests. Her O-Zone treatments, which are 3 sessions a week along with Vitamin C injections are costing her $1000 a week. Juliana is also trying to go abroad and receive treatment that is not available in Canada or the United States, which is costing her 18, 955 USD for 3 weeks and that is assuming she would only need 3 weeks. Our goal is to raise as much as we can to aid Juliana's battle. Doctors have informed Juliana that she is incurable and left her with little hope. Our intention is to try and find a way to beat the odds or at least have Juliana live a comfortable life with the cancer.

Aggie saw the Celebrations of Life as an opportunity to help others who were battling breast cancer, and decided to use future events as fundraisers, and started her own 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization to do so.The next event was bigger, more ambitious–a full production fashion show featuring breast cancer survivors that included makeup artists, hair stylists, and a news anchor emcee from the local CBS News affiliate. It was called the Denim and Diamonds Breast Cancer Survivors Fashion Show Gala, and it was a hit. The fundraiser was a huge success, and the Morgenthals gave away every penny. Part of the funds went directly to the Memorial Breast Cancer Center in Hollywood, Florida, where Aggie first underwent treatment. The rest went to La Liga Contra El Cancer, an organization that helps Latina women who do not have insurance or critical funds to aid in their battle with cancer. In the years that followed, Aggie continued to plan and execute silent auctions, dinner events, raffles, and more to raise money for these causes so dear to her heart.Her own cancer returned in 2012, after 9 and a half years in remission. This time, she underwent a radical mastectomy and reconstruction surgery. She remained hopeful throughout her procedures and the recovery process that followed, and continued to be a rock for her family and friends. Her husband has, on more than one occasion, summed up Aggie’s toughness throughout the ordeal with two simple words: “She’s nails.”In 2017, 15 years after her initial diagnosis, the cancer returned for a third time. This time, it was classified as metastatic breast cancer, stage 4. Less than two years later, in January of 2019, doctors determined the cancer had moved into her liver, and that brings us to where we are today.If you’ve ever met her, you know that Aggie is a very special kind of person. She is rarely idle, always working towards a new goal, whether at work or in her own life. She is quick with a witty remark and quicker to help a friend in need. Her friends and coworkers treasure her wisdom and her compassion immeasurably. She is a loving wife to her husband, Tom, and a wonderful mother to her 18-year-old son, Tommy. Aggie has always viewed her battle with cancer as a learning experience, an opportunity to grow, and most importantly, a reason to help others, and her indominable spirit is a constant inspiration to everyone around her. Aggie has continued her giving back and helping vision, she’s been very active in her local market with raising research dollars for the South Carolina Susan G. Komen affiliate in Greenville, SC. Friends of Aggie and the Morgenthal family started this GoFundMe in honor of that spirit. Aggie is a helper, and now, we hope that you will consider sending her some help. Money raised from this campaign will be given to the Morgenthals as relief toward their critical medical costs.

I just got out of the hospital yesterday. My white cell count fell below a 2 and dropped again below 1. I was there for several days and have now accumulated more hospital bills. I have started with Texas Oncology up in Dallas area, (but continue to see my Oncologist in Austin as well) in the beginning of February going back on treatments again. Anything will help: prayers, words of encouragement and any financial contribution. This is our first time reaching out for any help, but we are at a very difficult and critical time. My situation has become more than we can handle at this time. As of right now we have reached $10,000 of our $25,000 goal. I was diagnosed with cancer back in November of 2011, the day before Thanksgiving and 2 days before my birthday. I have kept a positive outlook for both my son and I. As well as for my whole family. I've been battling Cancer for over 7 years and was deemed terminal in 2012 giving me 2-3 years. Well I'm a fighter (going on 6yrs strong) and won't go down without a fight. I've been battling Crohn's disease now for over 13 years. Recently over the past few months I have been hospitalized 6 times and in and out of the ER 2 to 3 times weekly. My insurance has been a constant battle and has told me that most of the expenses are going to be for me to pay out of pocket roughly 80% is out of pocket. I have a lot of traveling back and forth 2-4 times a month to see my Oncologist and primary Dr. in Austin that puts me driving 4.5 hrs one way to see them for a total of 9 hrs in a day. My family has been strong for me but it is taking its toll on us financially. Treatments for me are costing on average $30k a year. We have had to put our family expenditures on hold (even groceries and necessities, including for our son). It has been financially and a stressful strain on one working income. I'm asking for your support so that I may continue this fight. I'm fighting for my family, but most of all because my ""SON"" deserves to have his mother around for as long as he can!!! Any donation at this critical time is very much appreciated!!! Thank you in advanced. Sincerely and With Much Love, Corrie and my Fam Bam.

She would eat some crackers or a few bites of a sandwich, then she'd start feeling full. She started losing weight and was fatigued, but she still kept babysitting her grandbaby whenever she was needed, and spent many of her weekends driving to Bryan, three hours away, to spend time with her widowed mother. All the while, she was feeling ill, but like a mama bear, our Mom is reluctant to let on when she's unwell. Finally, in August 2018, even Mom's iron will started to fade, and she began seeking treatment. For months, doctors prodded her. They ordered invasive and expensive tests, but couldn't figure out what was wrong. Finally, the Friday before Thanksgiving, she went to the emergency room in excruciating pain. The doctors performed a laparoscopy, and when she awoke from the anesthesia, they told her the news no one wants to hear: ""It's cancer, and it's everywhere.""Maribelle has a very rare form of cancer that strikes only one in a million: mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix. In a cruel twist, she had her appendix removed in 2007, which means this cancer has been growing in her abdomen, undetected, for 11 years. Hundreds of  tumors now encase most of the organs in her belly—her large intestine, gallbladder, spleen, liver and perhaps more.(Images from Maribelle's laparoscopy)Fifteen years ago, this diagnosis would have been a death sentence. This cancer, which is part of a group of cancers called peritoneal cancer, does not typically respond to traditional chemotherapy. But in the early 2000s, a new treatment called Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy, or HIPEC, began extending the lives of patients by as much as 10+ years.HIPEC will be one of the biggest trials of Maribelle's life. The surgery itself can last up to 16 hours, as surgeons remove any expendable organs and painstakingly excise tumors from what remains, then bathe the abdominal cavity in heated, high-intensity chemotherapy drugs for two hours. When the surgery is over, Maribelle will spend several days in the ICU, stay in the hospital for at least two weeks, and will be out of work for several more as her body recovers. The scar will run the length of her abdomen, from her sternum to her pelvis, and it may be six months to a year before she's fully recovered.Learn more about HIPEC here Maribelle has weathered a lot in her life. As a single working mom, she singlehandedly raised two children and two stepchildren. (That’s one mom and FOUR kids!) During the recession of 2008, she was unexpectedly laid off from her employer of 20+ years, and she went back to school to create a new career for herself in her 50s. Now, Maribelle is too young for Medicare but finds herself facing a daunting medical emergency. Although she has a good job and health insurance, she will be taking a great deal of unpaid time off, and she’ll be  reaching her maximum out-of-pocket limit twice, once for treatment in 2018 and again for 2019.  Your donations will go directly to her hospital fees and other necessary expenses.Fortunately, Maribelle has three things on her side:(Dr Patricio Polanco)1) A great surgical team. We're fortunate to be working with Dr Polanco at UT Southwestern. He is an experienced provider of HIPEC, and we are confident he and his team will give Maribelle the best care in Texas.(Maribelle and grandson Tom)2) A great attitude. If you've met Maribelle, you know she is 100% a  steel magnolia. She's loving and warm, but also highly determined. She  would do anything for her family.  She has four young grandchildren and another due this spring, and Maribelle is not going to let anything get in the way of playing with her precious grandbabies.3) Loving friends and family. Maribelle comes from a family that's as tight-knit as they come, and is surrounded by friends and a church community who are ready to help her through this difficult time. We are already planning to spend weeks of our own time off—paid and unpaid—helping Mom as she heals. She will initially need assistance with all the small tasks of everyday life—dressing, bathing, etc—and will require a special diet for many months. For this reason, she won't be needing meals, but if you'd like to find another way to help her, please send us a message. It's likely she will be needing help with driving, errands, lifting and other tasks for months after the surgery. Thank you again for your help. Together we can get through this difficult moment and help the woman who's given so much, so lovingly, to so many.",e34b4bddb83f38d358152dc78756f43a,38,0.6888125,8.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Or, rather, we rescued each other. The Navajos have a serious stray dog problem, and the crippling poverty of the Reservation creates less-than-ideal living conditions for their dogs, many of whom become abandoned. Such was the case with Tucker. He showed up at the front step of my house to drink from the pot of water I put out for the homeless dogs on my street, and looked at me through the screen door with the saddest eyes I had ever seen.Since that day, Tucker and I have become closer and closer, and have developed a bond that is hard to describe. I know that sounds magical and, if you saw how scared he was when I first met him, you would know that word is very appropriate. He quickly became my best friend in a place of desolation and loneliness. This was my first time truly away from all family and friends, and I was bored out of my mind and struggling to connect with people. I was working for DNA-People's Legal Services for an unpaid internship, but I spent my free time (and a good deal of time at work) being a dog whisperer of sorts. It was hard for me to make friends in such a short time there, and although my little 9 year old neighbor Dinesha and my roomate Chad were around most of the time, the one who laid by my side the whole time was Tucker. My constant companion, Tucker was there for me this summer, and I became his source of food, water, shelter, and most most importantly, love. Unfortunately, Tucker's story is not filled with all sunshine and rainbows. Before he arrived at my door, he had been roaming around the streets and hunting for his food after his owner abandoned him. He had accumulated about 40 ticks engorged all over his body. The process of removing all the ticks was painstaking; Tucker didn't like the flea and tick spray, and he ran away if I made any sudden movements. Tucker was very distrustful at first, and he still is with strangers and little kids. However, slowly but surely, I gained his trust, through food and affection, and as I moved the food bowl further and further into my house, Tucker began to trust me more. Then, one day, I turned around and he was gone. He had snuck into my bedroom and laid down on my bed. That day, Tucker decided that I was going to be his home, forever. Although many Navajos care for and love their dogs much the same as I do, it was definitely a different environment concerning dogs on the Reservation. Most of the dogs are not house pets and some are not pets at all. Estimates vary, but there are about 5,000 stray dogs on the Reservation alone. So, although Tucker may be unique in many ways, his predicament was quite common. Unfortunately, while roaming the Reservation, Tucker had his fair share of sexual encounters. As most of the dogs on the Reservation do not get spayed or neutered, there is a high prevalence of canine coitis, and it has serious repercussions, as I found out months later. I decided to bring Tucker and his brother Red back to Wisconsin to give them homes. I took them to the vet in Chinle, Arizona and paid to get them neutered and all of their vaccinations so they would be healthy and ready for a new home in Wisconsin. After my time was done on the Navajo Reservation, my brother and I brought Tucker and Red (his brother)back to Wisconsin on a weeklong road trip that brought puke, diarrhea, and some amazing moments as well.Zach, Red, Me and Tucker at Monument ValleyRed and Tucker snoozing and cruisingHiking through the canyons of Moab, UtahOnce back in Wisconsin, I was worried that Tucker wouldn't get along well with out dog, Koda. Tucker quickly dispelled any doubts that I had, and soon him and Koda were running around the yard and cuddling together in my bed. After the fighting, ticks, and other obstacles all seemed to fade away, I thought Tucker was home safe and sound.However, in September, he started to bleed from his penis. The bleeding got pretty bad, and he was making a mess in the house, so we had to put a diaper on him at all times. The veterinarian diagnosed him with a Transmissable Veneral Tumor (TVT), an unusual cancer, one that is uncommon in this part of the country.Fortunately, we learned that this is actually a very treatable disease; at this stage there is a 90-95% rate of successful removal. The treatment will cost about $300 per visit, and it usually takes about 6 rounds of chemo to cure this type of tumor. The tumor is highly contagious, and he is currently living with my family and other dog, Koda, so we will be starting treatment right away on January 19th. I am currently a fourth-year student in college and don't have the money to pay for thetreatment. I work two jobs on campus and already have sizable student loans waiting for me when I graduate, so any help would be greatly appreciated. You should also know that any help will be paid forward inthe future. I have already found homes for three dogs on my own this summer, and a big thank-you goes out to my cousin Nick and his wife Carly (and their dog Jasper) for taking my beloved Red into their hearts and home, as well as the woman who adopted my little friend Shaggy. I volunteer regularly at the Poweshiek Animal League Shelter. I put more time in this summer as a dog whisperer than a law clerk, and I have no qualms about it. Those of you who know Tucker know that he is usually terrified of meeting new people and as a rule does not trust strangers. So, if you could give him a reason to put his faith back in people by helping out his cause, he would greatly appreciate it.I wish everyone could love someone the way Tucker loves me. The unbridled joy with which he greets me every time I walk in the door, no matter how long my absence, fills my heart with joy every day.

Je venais de vivre une séparation déchirante puisque j'avais un petit garçon âgé de moins de 2 ans... Le 5 décembre, je faisais la rencontre d'une femme merveilleuse, un coup de foudre, qui s'est révélé être mon âme soeur, la flamme de ma vie. Cependant, le lendemain, alors que je suivais une formation de pilote, mon rêve professionnel, une nouvelle terrible tombait, j'apprenais que j'avais un cancer des testicules. Tout s'est bousculé très vite ensuite: le 23 décembre suivant, je subissais ma première opération et la chimiothérapie débutait en janvier 2011. Ce traitement a duré jusqu'au 31 mars et j'ai été extrêmement malade. Ma conjointe, que je venais tout juste de rencontrer, était présente et me soutenait malgré les difficultés et les embûches sur notre chemin.  Je me relevais tranquillement, mais sûrement. Par la suite,  en tentant de reprendre le cours normal de ma vie, j'étais engagé chez Skyjet, une compagnie d'aviation, afin de me rapprocher de mon emploi de pilote que j'aimais tant. Par contre, je n'ai jamais pu obtenir le certificat médical me permettant de reprendre à voler. Je n'abandonnais pas et je continuais d'avancer en occupant un emploi de bureau temporaire. Au moment où je devais obtenir la permission médicale afin de recommencer à piloter, le ciel m'est retombé sur la tête: le cancer était revenu, encore!! Mes ganglions lymphatiques étaient de nouveau inflamés et je devais être opéré encore... Une opération majeure qui a duré près de 10 heures et qui comportait un lot de risques très élevés. Nous apprenions au même moment que ma femme était enceinte... Enfin, nous avions l'impression de pouvoir respirer et nous pensions que la maladie était derrière nous.J'ai retroussé mes manches, encore une fois et je suis retourné au travail au printemps. Ma femme et moi n'avons eu quelques mois supplémentaires de répit, mais à l'automne 2012, une ombre revenait planer sur notre famille: je n'étais plus en rémission.Les émotions s'entre-mêlaient et avec la maladie, ces moments qui auraient dû n'être que du pur bonheur étaient déchirants et difficiles, un combat de chaque instant. Le cancer était plus fort. J'ai donc décidé de demander ma conjointe en mariage afin de ne pas laisser ma famille dans le besoin, si jamais le pire venait à arriver. Pendant ma nuit de noces, ma fille venait au monde, plus tôt que prévu. Ensuite, les médecins ont donc décidé d'y aller avec une chimiothérapie de pré greffe et deux chimiothérapies agressives nécessitant une greffe de cellules souches afin que mon système immunitiaire redémarre. Malheureusement, la première greffe n'a pas eu l'effet escompté, cela ne fonctionnait pas... Une nouvelle qui fût plutôt difficile à comprendre et à accepter. Les médecins m'offrent alors de m'opérer à nouveau, avec tout le lot de risque que cela comportait. Mai 2013: la chirurgie arrive enfin, mais on doit m'enlever un rein afin d'accéder à la tumeur. On a aussi dû m'enlever une partie importante de l'intestin et j'ai eu un nerf d'écrasé dans la jambe droite. Évidemment, les choses n'ont pas été aussi simples: post-opératoire a été un véritable cauchemar. Les points de sutures faits à l'intestin n'ont pas tenus comme prévu. J'ai fait de multiples infections qui m'ont amené à faire plusieurs séjours à l'hôpital pendant 8 mois, pour finalement me faire réopérer en décembre 2013 pour les intestins pour réparer ce petit bobo. Tous ces évènements ont été difficiles au niveau financier et m'ont obligé à faire faillite.En mars 2014, j'ai enfin pu retourner au travail dans une quincaillerie. Moi et ma femme tentions de reprendre une vie de famille normale et plus équilibrée. Nous avons réussit à maintenir ce fragile équilibre et nous avions espoir d'avoir laissé tout ça derrière nous. Nous avons donc reconstruit notre vie pendant un peu plus d'un an. BOOM!!! En mai 2015, il est de retour, petit et à un seul endroit. En août 2015, une opération préventive est alors effectuée et une nouvelle chimiothérapie, très agressive, est recommencée, afin d'être sûr que cette fois serait la bonne. La chimiothérapie s'est terminée en février 2016, mais encore une fois, nous n'avions pas les résultats escomptés. Les médecins du Québec ne peuvent plus m'offrir de solutions et ma meilleure option devient la recherche et les traitements expérimentaux. Je n'ai pas abandonné et je suis parti à Toronto pour essayer des traitements expérimentaux de phase 1. Ça a duré encore quelques mois, où je devais voyager entre ma résidence de Québec et l'hôpital de Toronto. Cependant, une meilleure option s'offre maintenant à moi: des traitements de phase 2 offerts à New-York que la Régie de l'assurance maladie ne couvre pas.Même si je reçois une grande aide de la fondation Nez pour vivre, je suis plus que conscient qu'elle n'a pas un sac sans fonds pour m'aider à payer mes traitements.Ces soins coûtent cependant très cher et ce, sans compter les déplacements que je devrai effectuer dans un autre pays. C'est ici et maintenant que j'ai besoin de votre aide. Vos dons me permettraient d'obtenir les soins dont j'ai grandement besoin et de couvrir mes déplacements entre Québec et New-York Ma course pour la vie est loin d'être terminée et je vous remercie d'avance pour toute l'aide que vous m'apporterez!***ENGLISH VERSION***In 2010, my life was turned upside down in many ways ... I had just experienced a heartbreaking separation and I had a little boy under the age of two. On December 5th, lightning struck me, I met a wonderful woman who turned out to be my soul mate, the light of my life. However, the next day as I was undergoing pilot training, my professional dream, I received terrible news, I learned that I had testicular cancer.Everything rushed by very quickly then: on December 23rd I underwent my first operation and then began chemotherapy in January of 2011. The treatments lasted until March 31st and I was extremely ill. My girlfriend, whom I had just met, was always present and supported me despite the difficulties and the pitfalls along the way. Slowly but surely, I was able to get back on my feet. Then, trying to get back to a normal life, I was hired by Skyjet, an airline company, to get closer to my goal as a pilot that I loved so much. However, I was never able to obtain the medical certificate allowing me to resume flying. I did not give up and I continued to advance in a temporary office job.When I had to get medical permission to start piloting again, my world collapsed: the cancer had returned again!! My lymph nodes were again inflamed and I had to be operated again ... a major operation that lasted nearly 10 hours and which involved a lot of very high risks. Finally, we felt we could breathe a little and we thought the disease was behind us. We learned at the same time that my girlfriend was pregnant. I rolled up my sleeves again and went back to work in the spring. My girlfriend and I had a few more months of hope, but in the fall of 2012, there was a shadow over our family: I was no longer in remission.  Emotions intermingled and with the illness, these moments which should have been pure happiness were heartbreaking and difficult, a struggle at every moment. The cancer was stronger. So I decided to ask my girlfriend to marry me so as not to leave my family in need, if ever the worst happened. During my wedding night, my beautiful daughter was born sooner than expected. Then the doctors decided to go with pre-graft chemotherapy and two aggressive chemotherapy treatments requiring stem cell transplantation to restart my immune system. Unfortunately, the first graft did not have the desired effect, it did not work. A piece of news that was rather difficult to understand and accept. The doctors then offered to operate again with all the risks involved. May 2013: the surgery finally arrives, but they have to remove a kidney in order to access the tumor. They also had to remove a large part of the intestine and I had a crushed nerve in the right leg. Obviously, things were not that simple: the post-operation was a nightmare. The stitches made to the intestine did not hold as expected. I got multiple infections which led me to have several stays in the hospital for 8 months, to finally re-operate in the intestines once again in December 2013 to repair a small tear. All these events were difficult financially and forced me to go bankrupt. In March 2014, I finally went back to work at a hardware store. My wife and I resumed a more normal and balanced family life. We managed to maintain this fragile equilibrium and we hoped to have left all that behind us. So we started to rebuild our lives. Well that lasted for a little over a year.BOOM!!! In May 2015, the cancer was back, small and in one place. In August 2015, a preventive operation is carried out and a new chemotherapy, very aggressive, is restarted, in order to be sure that this time it is the right one. Chemotherapy was completed in February of 2016, but again, we did not have the results we wanted. The Quebec physicians could no longer offer me solutions and my best option became research and experimental treatments. I did not give up but was obligated to go to Toronto to try an experimental Phase 1 treatment. It lasted a few months and I had to keep travelling between my residence in Quebec City and the Toronto hospital. Unfortunately, even though this treatment was very experimental and there wasn’t a big chance that it would work and it didn’t meet our expectations, it gave me a chance to meet the experts in research. A better option now exists for me: Phase 2 treatments offered in New York. Unfortunately, the Health Insurance Board does not cover these treatments. This is the reason why I decided to use GoFundMe to help me financially. I’m sure you can imagine the costs in the U.S.  It is for this reason that I am asking for your help. I wish to help those who are helping me. I am more than aware that the Foundation Nez pour Vivre does not have a bottomless purse.These treatments are very expensive, plus, I will have to travel to another country. It is here and now that I need your help. Your donations would allow me to get much needed care and to cover my travelling costs between Quebec City and New York. My race for life is far from over and I thank you in advance for all the help that you will bring me!",d85d85f21f09cf49fd38536092417029,90,0.594255,720.0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I have been staring at this blank screen for what feels like days. In this chapter of my life, I truly need your love and support. I am asking my expansive community to come together and please offer what they can. In 2018, I began feeling deep waves of fatigue which brought me to research Lyme and Autoimmune Diseases.  Everything then shifted in November when I found a lump in my left breast. What followed was multiple mammograms, ultrasounds, and 2 invasive biopsies. On December 21st I received the call and heard the nurse say the mass was malignant. In that moment I was diagnosed with breast cancer. The cancer is known as INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA. There is still much unknown simply because the mass is still within my body. Genetic testing is needed since breast cancer does not run in my family. Also, another chest MRI for more details and then the partial mastectomy. This will be followed by a reconstructive surgery and then 6 weeks of daily radiation. After this, hormonal therapy for 5 years. Chemotherapy is still in question until my first surgery is had and lymph nodes are analyzed through pathology. The tumor is a quarter in scale. The stage of my cancer is still unknown.I am presently trying to slow down and intentionally build my foundation for healing. This moment in life is guiding me to learn the importance of asking for what I need and allowing myself the gift to receive. A good reminder we are part of a larger whole. And so, this is where you come in. I want to remove as much financial stress as possible so I can focus on caring for myself. I do have insurance which covers part but the co-pays and unforeseen expenses will add up. I want to fully support my immune and nervous system through integrative modalities (e.g., acupuncture, massage, reiki, herbs, and nutrition). I want to afford a home I can have friends and family stay with me during recovery. Being a single woman living alone in New York City makes this a very creative project since it is one of the most expensive cities in the world. Being an artist, I am up for the challenge. The surreal aspect of this news has been like no other. At times the weight of this reality swings between a bag of bricks to a heightened state full of gratitude. Going through so many emotions with the knowing this chapter will forever change me. With this said, I thank you for loving and supporting me to live a full, creative life while I continue on this journey. Please know I am forever grateful for your contributions. Onward!Thank you.

Their normal day-to-day routine of going to school, work, play dates, family events, loving snuggles, and carefree giggles have been replaced with bi-weekly chemotherapy treatments, endless doctor appointments, scans, tests, hospital stays and some days of complete isolation.  Although each day brings new obstacles, my brother, Derek, and Jill have chosen faith to be more powerful than fear, and continue to look for the positives within each day.  They are especially grateful for the tremendous support from their caring friends and family.  We're all working together to fight this terrible disease and develop a new normal.How You Can HelpWith the loss of Jill's income, increasing medical bills and the challenging needs of their two children, ages 2 and 5, the financial circumstances are a cause for high stress.

The set goal will be a significant help in meeting their monthly family living expenses for this next year.

I am now asking you, who might have been touched by their story, to please lift them up during this difficult time.   Your generosity is so appreciated and we feel that with this financial goal, we can truly help the McClain family.Feel compelled to do even more?

He proceeded to buy a pack of donuts and a drink and went and sit down at one of the tables but, before he could get seated at a table, the owner, Donna Crosby, grabbed him by his shirt and pulled him into her office. She told him “IF HE WAS GOING TO EAT IN HERE HE WOULD HAVE TO COVER HIS FACE!!” He left and went home in tears to tell me what happened.My father is a cancer survivor he lost his left eye and nose to this awful cancer. My father was discriminated against because of the way he looks. He cannot help what the cancer did to him. My father is the strongest man iIknow but, as he told me what happened to him, I watched tears roll out of his eye. It hurt me to see him hurt like this, especially over something he cannot help. My father is also on a fixed income and can not afford the surgeries it would to take to fix his where his nose was. Just so you know, Donna Crosby, my father can not cover his face with an eye patch. It rubs the eye socket raw and where his nose was. It has to stay open and nothing is to touch that area that might rub it raw. I thank GOD every one is not as small mined as Donna Crosby! I promise you he will never ever set foot in that store again! You should never judge a book by its cover until u have walked a mile in his shoes Donna Crosby. You discriminated against MY farther (Kirby Evans) for the way he looks. Here are some words of advise for you.

We do ourbest to see to his every day needs. However I can not afford his medical bills and he is on a fixed income.   I or my Dad would be using your kind donations to cover his medical costs for Dr. visits and surgery's/recovery he may need. We also would like to look into getting him a prosthetic nose. When dad first had his nose and eye removed do to the (basal cell carcinoma) they had to remove a lot of bone from his face and aroundhis eye. They had to get clean margins.I am sad to say it looks as if his body is rejecting some of the material  that they used to reconstruct around his eye.So this is one of the major things we need to have checked.   I would also like to have him checked from head to toe to make sure he is still cancer free. He has a spot that I am worried about on top of his head and it needs to be checked asap. Dad also has a few other health issues that I am concerned with he has high blood pressure,diabetes and his eye needs to be checked,as I can see that his eye sight is failing. Last time he had his eye checked he could not afford the special glasses he would need made.The Eye Dr. would have to make him something like a eye monocle that would clipto his hat.     Dad and I set up a joint account at a bank here in Walterboro to receive the funds that you all so generously donated to him.Kirby Evans is the primary and I am the secondary on this account we set it up together.

I was also found to have pre cancerous cells in my cervix. Since then I have undergone numerous and various procedures including the freezing and invasive scraping of the cervix as well as multiple rounds of radiation. I am now in my 3rd and God willing final round of radiation and this treatment has been blessedly effective  and my Doctors are confident in my recovery and say its time to begin the steps needed in order to finally undergo the  surgery to remove both the right ovary as well as the right fallopian tube. I had hoped to under go the treatment and the surgery without having to involve my loved ones and hoped to avoid, at least to my mind, bringing them unnecessary worry or unintentional burdens caused by an unavoidable and unforeseen situation. I can only hope that my decision to deal with this in the only way I knew how hasn't caused anyone to be offended. But as my treatment has progressed it has become near impossible to keep it quiet because it has become increasingly more evident that i am not well and that im hiding the fact that there is something wrong. Kevin and I have managed to keep our heads slightly above water by putting in extra hours at work and taking side jobs, but after my last appointment I've been forced to take a leave of absence to avoid the risk of getting even something as simple as a cold. I have almost no immune system right now and a cold could set me back.  My insurance only fully covers 2 pet scans in a 12 month period. I've reached that limit. Unfortunately I am unable to proceed with surgery without another PET scan. And while im lucky that they cover a  portion of the test the remaining balance is still way more than we can come up with. No matter how I've worked the numbers it is financially impossible for us to come up with the amount  while still managing to pay for rent, utilities, food and my medication. . I NEED HELP.

Busy raising her 6 beautiful children, and thrilled about the arrival of her 7th blessing from God, due to arrive this summer!  In late January 2016 a biopsy of a swollen lymph node on her neck led to a discovery of a rare head cancer.  At the time of diagnosis Joline was 17 weeks pregnant. News of this discovery at this stage of her young life is unimaginable! Her doctors are very limited to treatment options because of her pregnancy. But Joline is not letting this obstacle shake her faith in God and His divine plan for her life and her family.For those of us who know and love Joline, she is a selfless giver! In addition to doting on her kids she is a devoted wife to her husband Ray.  A loving daughter and sister,  a loyal friend to everyone who knows her.  Dedication to her family has led Joline to choose to work a home based business.  This business model is not only a way for her to contribute to her family's financial support but it allows her to be an example of possibility to her kids as well. Her entrepreneur's spirit and flexible schedule has afforded her the opportunity to homeschool and be a significant presence in the daily lives of her family. When I asked Joline what she wanted or needed from her friends, she simply asked us to PRAY! I am confident that we can do that and so much more!FOOD is her MEDICINE! Joline is immediately doing EVERYTHING in her power to FLOOD her body with the best nutrition money can buy.  At this point, if it is healthy, organic and nutritious, cost should not be a concern. This has got to be a FAMILY MISSION to get healthy together! Feeding a family of 8 (almost 9) is a costly feat on any budget.  We'd like to raise enough money to hire a professional to help completely revamp the family's diet as well as shop and prepare meals for Joline and the family.  Joline also expressed a desire to purchase an alkaline water filtration system because of the enormous health benefits it provides.We are at the beginning of this fight and we want Joline to focus all of her energies on getting well! Worrying about money and meeting the needs to come (seen and unforeseen) is not where we want her concerns to be!Please honor Joline's simple request to PRAY FOR HER HEALING!!  She is deeply grateful to you for that! If you feel that you'd like to help us lift her up with a donation we've made that easy for you here.Do you believe in MIRACLES?? If you do, we ask you to join your faith with Joline's and we will see the Hand of God move in ways we could have never imagined!!If you want to connect with Joline  click here to send her a personal email message.Please help us spread the word about  this campaign by sharing it!

My dad is the strongest and most fearless person I know. He has been battling Brain Cancer for 7 years now, as of February 2,2018 he went under for his Third open Brian surgery to remove another tumour. Our Neurosurgeon Doctor Matt Wheatley in Edmonton Alberta has been fantastic with our family. He got what he went in for on the second. After surgery my dads left side had a bit of deficits, after every other brain surgery he was out of the hospital and fully mobile within 3-7 days. This time it was a bit different. U OF A Hospital released him to Fort Mcmurray Ab Hospital. In that mean time my father remained in the hospital and starting physiotherapy to regain strength of his left side. February 16,2018 he had his first day pass where he got to go out with myself and his father Harvey. We went to his favourite restaurant Eat Clean then got to come home for a hour to be in his own home. On Saturday February 17,2018 we went to pick him up for another day pass, when we got there things weren’t exactly as planned.. he had taken a fall at 4am, as we got there they were taking him for a CT to make sure there was no new brain bleeds. He slept that entire day and was having a hard time responding to questions, unless they were one worded answers. The CT results came back that his lateral ventricle has enlarged producing a extra amount of fluid, and the drain to release this fluid is obstructed, because my dad isn’t able to go under for another surgery they gave him only a few weeks to live... they started him on a high dosage of steroids to reduce the swelling and prolong as much time as possible. Due to the swelling it was pushing the right side of the brain over line explaining why there was left side deficits. Since the steroids (started at level 6) he is now able to walk little distance at one time on his own. They have now dropped steroids to a level 4. I’m asking for your help because we found our last option... We have found a Advanced Cancer Clinic In Scottsdale Arizona. They have a IV treatment that is known to work for this situation my dad is in. A man in Saskatchewan was in the same boat and went to them for this treatment and 16 years later he’s still doing good. The clinic this is offered at is Envita medical Centre . What they offer is a aggressive treatment threw IV, they can track if it’s working on a daily basis. As well as can trace back to what keeps reoccurring the cancer to come back.For my dad they recommended 6-12 weeks of treatment. This treatment is 8000 USD A WEEK. Plus you have to stay in a Hotel and your meals (Hotels do have special rates for outpatients) .If you personally know my dad you know that he is not willing to go without a fight. He’s not ready to stop fighting and has his heart set on doing this treatment. My dad was a firefighter for 10+ years and worked in the smelter in our home town, Flin Flon Manitoba for 15 years. Our family then relocated to Fort Mcmurray Alberta where he then started with CNRL.He enjoys baseball, hockey, and going to his fly out fishing camp him and his father have built. He has the kindest heart, and always helps everyone the best he can when they are in need. From the bottom of my families heart I am reaching out for help. All proceeds will go directly to my father. Thank you for your time reading this, for your thoughts and prayers and simply all the extra love towards our family.

The family is requesting donations to help with mounting medical bills and out of pocket expenses. Please read Teresa’s story below:Early in May of 2017, Teresa Sensinger was diagnosed with Glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. She underwent surgery but due to the tumor’s location, total removal was not possible. From there, Teresa underwent vigorous physical therapy along with high dose chemo and radiation therapies. Her surgery had left her with some physical deficits, but her positive spirit was unwavering. By August, Teresa was able to come home from the hospital just in time to celebrate her seventh birthday with family and friends. Through the summer and fall, her doctors continued with the most aggressive treatment options possible to prevent the reoccurrence and spread of the cancer cells. Unfortunately, by fall of 2017, the doctors found that the tumors had returned. Through the help of the “Make-A- Wish Foundation”, Teresa was able to walk the beautiful beaches of Florida, visit Sea World, Disney, the Kennedy Space Center, and visit with family in Georgia.After returning home from her trip, Teresa continued with her chemo treatments. In January, a follow up scan revealed several new tumors extending down her spine. Her doctors determined that as aggressive as the chemo was, it just wasn’t working. The medical team decided to discontinue the chemo, and began a palliative course of radiation. Teresa completed this last course of treatment on February 20th, but was readmitted to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) just two days later with nausea and uncontrollable headaches. Her doctors have worked tirelessly searching for treatment options to give her relief. At that time, Teresa was experiencing severe balance deficits and had lost most of her hearing, and later her ability to speak, but the hope was that these were side effects of the radiation and would subside with time.This past Friday, Teresa’s parents, Andrew and Michelle, sat down with their team of doctors and received the worst news any parent could imagine. The latest scan showed the tumor had now wrapped around Teresa’s brain stem and there was nothing more they could do. This coming Tuesday, the hospital will be transporting her back home under hospice care, where she can be surrounded by her family and loved ones. Due to mounting medical bills and out of pocket expenses not all covered by insurance, the family is requesting donations to alleviate the financial burden on Andrew and Michelle. Remember, every little bit helps and no contribution is too small as we read in Mark 12: 41-44.The family also requests your prayers during this difficult time. All donations will be given to the Sensinger family, Michelle and Andrew.￼￼￼￼￼￼",7fa215518537e35ce1aa60aa31e93c1e,21,0.86248,300.0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.00211864406779661,0.0,0.02718717323109097,1.8380028954348202,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

At this point, the tumor is too extensive to remove surgically and they have started chemotherapy at Miller Children's Hospital to try and shrink the tumor small enough to remove safely. The chemotherapy is projected to take at least 9 months and there is a possibility that they may need to do additional chemo or radiation therapy before they can operate. Caleb won't be able to go back to school for at least a year and Jordan will be staying home to care for him and do home school, while Christine works as a school teacher.  With only one income to support the family and the uncertainty of medical expenses, the last thing they should be worrying about are finances in this difficult time. I wanted to help in any way that I could, so I asked them to create a GoFundMe account so that I can spread the word and share. Help support this awesome family while Caleb fights cancer.Thank you so much.Sincerely,John-Eric Gabagat",bd0b44896473d005439018a3ec3049f7,9,0.864875,1200.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Whilst shoveling, I let Pancho and Holly ""help"" me out. By help I mean run around the yard playing in the snow and saying Hi to all the neighbors. This is something I always do with the dogs, but unlike all the other times when the dogs and I went back in the house, I noticed Holly limping. She was still her joyful, energetic self so initially I didn't believe it to be an issue. Fast forwarding to now, she is still limping and also had an open wound on her opposite leg which we thought was a spider bite that had gotten worse. My wife and I decided it was time to go to the vet. Unfortunately, the wound is not a spider bite. Her joyful and energetic demeanor are poor indicators in regard to how Holly is really feeling. Holly has a cancerous tumor on her left paw and a torn ACL in her right leg. This is absolutely disheartening to my wife and I because to some they are just dogs, but to us they are our kids. They are essential members of our family. They add value to our day to day lives and our family is not whole without Holly. Anybody who does know Claudia and I also know that everything in our life includes Holly. People who have seen us interact with Holly understand that we do not treat her like a ""pet"". So what are we doing for Holly? We got this news today and 2 hours later I have two applications in for a second job and more to come. So I am going to give every minute of my free time to ensuring that her life can be continued and the quality of her life can continue to be great after she overcomes this obstacle. So you can rest assure that I'm not just asking for a handout without putting forth all of my own effort as well. For those of you who do know me, I don't ask anybody for anything and I always take care of my family so for me to do this is very humbling. Holly's first surgery, to remove the tumor on her left paw, is the 23rd of November. Exactly 10 days from today. We're hopeful that it will only require one surgery and that the cancer has not spread. This surgery is going to be $1,227.98. Her ACL repair surgery is going to be after she recovers from her tumor removal. For her ACL, we were quoted $5,000. We are hopeful that we can get her in immediately after the tumor removal so that she can rest and recover during the long winter months and then be back to her normal self for the summer. Whether you contribute $1.00 or $100, I appreciate even the slightest consideration. I wish the circumstances were different and that I didn't have to ask, but we really do need help to get Holly the medical attention she needs.

Ashton with Mom, Dad and little brother Grayson. Happy, healthy and and full of life. Every day was a joy to watch our children grow; excited for the life that we were going to create together….Something is not rightOn November 16, 2017, life as we knew it, as Ashton knew, changed. Ashton had recently been complaining of headaches leading up to that day. We didn’t think much of it because he was still “Ashton”. Happy, inquisitive, ready to learn something new and ready to play. His condition suddenly worsened. He began to vomit, lose his balance and his eyes were starting to go crossed. We immediately took him to the local hospital where we were told that there was something seriously wrong and that we needed to take him to Vanderbilt Children's Hospital right away. The doctors performed an MRI and they discovered multiple tumors growing on his brain. In an instant, our worst nightmare became a reality. Ashton has brain cancer.                           The long road to recoveryOn November 20, Ashton underwent brain surgery to remove a large tumor on his cerebellum, as this was the immediate concern to his health.

The doctors determined that the remaining tumors can be treated with high dose chemo and possible radiation for the next 7-8 months.

Life was moving along for us - certainly we had some bumps along the road, but never did we expect to receive the news we did.  On December 3, 2015, I experienced what was thought to be a seizure or stroke. I was rushed to the hospital, put through many tests, and by the end of the day was being transferred to Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix with what was determined to be an aggressive brain tumor called Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). In an instant, my thoughts went from the joy the holidays bring to “what do I need to do to fight this and WIN so I can see my four beautiful children grow up?” I was told to prepare for the worst and given 10 months as a projected time to live. How did this happen? It really doesn't matter. What matters is my wife Aimee and I fully reject it, and we’re committed to fighting.  On December 14, 2015, I had a successful extended surgery where the doctor was very aggressive in removing the tumor. Now, we prepare for phase two which is to heal and get ready for chemotherapy and radiation. My diet and mindset have completely changed and we are going straight ahead at this. I came home from the hospital on my oldest daughters 12th birthday- what a blessing that was to be home to celebrate with her.  Just two weeks before my diagnosis, my company had to go through lay-offs, and unfortunately I was on the receiving end of that cut. With word of the lay offs, I had been proactive in a job search and fortunately had a final interview set up in New York for a very good position with a great company.  As it turned out the Friday before my surgery I had to contact the person I was supposed to interview with and take my name out of the running. Going through any unplanned disruption in a career is a severe blow to a family of six, but coupled with the news on the 3rd of December, we knew that we needed to reach out to those who love and support us, and ask for some help. This was not easy for Aimee and me. But through many discussions we know that there are good people out there looking to help, people who have asked what they can do to help, so here we are. We are asking you to consider helping us financially; so we can get through some tough roads ahead.   There is a large financial component in our immediate future and your financial support would go to our medical and family costs. We have also decided that the best thing for our family is to pack up our house in Arizona and move to Washington where we have the support of family to help during these difficult times ahead.  Adding a move to our lives right now is a huge undertaking both financially and mentally, but we know it’s the right thing to do. I have been told after insurance, the costs are substantial.  I have already had over $100,000 worth of treatment expenses, and have been told to expect over $1 million in costs. We have been in touch with some doctors and people throughout the country who are helping us gain valuable information on how we can go at this aggressively. This includes traveling to different hospitals to see specialists for clinical trials that are out of state and very expensive. I also need to keep my current health insurance which is an important factor for me maintaining a great level of care, but the premiums are extremely high. Any contribution you can provide will help more than you know!  From the moment we got the news, Aimee and I believed there was a bigger reason that this was happening to our family. We do not question why, but say HOW are we going to use this to help others? I have had great satisfaction helping many people financially in my career, and to be a long-term cancer survivor I envision helping so many more! Our hope is that one day we will be sitting across from a family who has received devastating news as we did, and tell them that there is hope. We believe this with all of our hearts, and our faith has never been stronger. I am used to being on the giving side, but we find out life unfolds in ways we can never imagine. I am now in this role – one of needing and asking for help. I accept the fight and your help will allow me to cover heavy costs to do this. For those who are able to donate we will never be able to put into words how much we thank you. For those who aren’t able to donate, but hold us up in prayer we can’t thank you enough for that too. We are putting together a team to beat this, and we want every single person who reads our story to be on our team. It's a team that is dedicated to beating this, who believes in the win, and the glory that will come. We will pay this forward one day... it's our mission and we will not quit.  We remain faithful.

We are going to win… day by day we win each day! Thank you so much for your support and your prayers. The Staudt Family-Jeff, Aimee, Chloe(12), Madeleine(10), Frances(6), and Jack(4)WTD- “Win The Day”#wintheday",523307dd6502b071eae523227ad59c9e,47,0.7201,1110.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Any donation is greatly appreciated and will be a huge help to Sarah, Richard and Charlotte in paying for medical costs throughout this process. She is currently doing weekly chemo treatments to kick this cancer's ass. THANK YOU for loving on our girl Sarah!Here is Sarah's story in her own words (from July 13th Instagram Post):I wanted to share this today because I think when things don’t go our way or we get those “holy crap!” moments, Satan tends to instill fear in us and keep us silent. I feel strongly about using my words and speaking Truth. For the last few months I’ve been in and out of the hospital with what they thought was a cervical ectopic miscarriage. After weeks of bloodwork and emergency surgery, I thought the craziness was behind me and I was on the road to recovery. On July 5th, a day I will never forget, about a week post-surgery my doctor called me into her office which I knew in my gut something wasn't right. I felt the Lord say I’m not done with you yet and to not fear. I braced myself for impact as I tried to read all the lines in her face. I heard those three words no one wants to hear, you have cancer. The words rang in my ears and I couldn’t swallow. Me? I am 30 years old, feel good, healthy I thought, a mom... me? Are you sure? .... I’m not sure this news will ever sink in fully or maybe I’m choosing to reject it but I already see God at work. It’s amazing the people God puts in your path and it’s a perfect reminder to me that God goes before us. I was sent directly to an oncologist…who ironically, I had already met. She was in my OR the time I had my initial surgery. She specializes in GYN complicated surgery’s and they just happened to ask her to be there in case I needed a hysterectomy (she was off that night and there to watch). How crazy was it now, that one week later, I was sitting in her office. She’s amazing. I know I’m in good hands with Dr. Nik. But even better hands with God my father, the ultimate physician. Of course, I’ve had my share of temper tantrums and I may never have all the answers. But God and the Spirit have been working in my heart the last week like never before. I saw fear so close I could taste and touch it. I spoke OUTLOUD to fear and asked it to leave and never return. You should try it! Jesus has given me a peace that’s so overwhelming. I’m holding tight to the mantra “faith is bigger than my fears” and I say that over and over. This week has been full of tests and a waiting game before I got my clear diagnoses. During this time, it’s crazy to say, I’ve felt more alive than ever. I’m clinging to the word of Jesus because I know that is the only way. I want to be vocal about my journey because God will be glorified, I wouldn’t have it any other way. Through all of this, things are moving, in my family, and in people’s lives around me…it’s amazing to see God at work in the midst (more on that later). I’m learning to let Jesus lead the way while faith and gratitude have my hands. I didn’t choose this road but I’ll keep my feet steady with my eyes on Jesus. If you’ve been recently diagnosed or you are just struggling with fear, I hope these verses below bring truth and healing to your day. It sure renews my spirit. It’s food! Although this week has been a tough one, we celebrate a few victories. My scans came back clear so no other tumors in my body. The cancer is contained, and we just have to focus on the one tumor wedged between my uterus and cervix. Never thought I would be jumping up and down celebrating my ONE tumor, but I am! I am thankful! I start chemo July 23rd. I’m not sure what’s ahead of me but ready to take it on!My Dr. said something to me I will never forget, she said “Sarah I know you feel out of control (and if you know me I’m a control freak, I like to have the say) but here are some things you CAN control: what you put in your body, your mind, and spirit.. and who you surround yourself with.” That resonated with me in so many ways. That gave me a job, I love jobs! ;) I’m making some radical changes to my diet (green veggies and plants heal!) but most of all spiritual food. God heals, and I have full faith in this process. Let’s see how God can move! I’d like to ask anyone reading this to join me in prayer for complete healing of every cell. I pray that over myself and others. I know there are millions out there battling diseases so I pray peace that passes all understanding. And that God will use me where I am. The sign in my Dr.’s Office is “bloom where you are planted”. Love that…what an amazing reminder that this life is short and fleeting but for those who know Jesus we get the ultimate ending!! I may not be healthy according to a scan, but I am well! I’m learning to love what is and not dwell on the questions. I’m also learning to be still. (not something I’m good at) and listening to God’s voice.Exodus: 14:14 “.“The Lord WILL fight for you, you need only to be still”. Let’s keep our eyes fixed on Jesus and gratitude for the days were given. Let’s make them count! Love these words: “I lean not on my own understanding, my life is in the Hands of the maker of heaven. I give it all to you God trusting that you’ll make something beautiful out of me” .2 Corinthians 4:16-1816 Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardlywe are being renewed day by day. 17 For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.18 So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.",1d3bed489c9a5d888bd07d505ed0a184,72,0.7018333333333333,90.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I am a recurrent osteosarcoma cancer survivor looking for money to help fund the medical expenses, travel fair, and lodging of an amazing study out at the University of California - Los Angeles. I am 26 with clear ambitions of what I want to do with my life, loved ones I would do anything for, and every reason to be here. My journey starts 10 years ago in 2006 when x-rays showed a mass growing in my lower tibia (shin bone) and pressing against my fibula. I remember leaving the doctor's office not knowing what this meant. I noticed that my mom was silently weeping, and I put an arm around her and told her, ""it's gonna be okay. We got this."" To be honest I didn't know what ""this"" was, but I knew right then that this journey wasn't about me alone: it's about my family, friends, dreams and ambitions, who I will become, and why it's worth it to go through hell to emerge victorious on the other side. Since that time I've had four relapses. I’ve undergone multiple chemo regiments, dozens of surgeries, both on my leg and on my lungs where the cancer eventually spread, and more adversity than a single person should have to go through. However, I've learned much about myself, why I believe I'm destined to be here, and what I can accomplish in this world.  Despite relapses, I received my undergraduate degree in Kinesiology and was accepted in the Doctorate of Physical Therapy program at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Because of my experiences, I have a passion to help others move and regain control of their bodies after injury, ailment, and disease just like the amazing physical therapists of my past retaught me how to walk, how to exercise, and showed me all the things I could do after my various leg surgeries. I can’t wait for the opportunity to give back to others and help them regain their movement abilities.Three semesters into my DPT courses, and four and a half years of no sign of disease, routine scans showed a tumor at the bottom of my right lung. I had surgery to remove the tumor, but a month later, five nodules popped up in its place. Since then we have explored and undergone many different treatment options. While some treatments were successful for a time, we need to seek state-of-the-art treatment to take care of the cancer for good.  The University of California – Los Angeles has an advanced study that uses my own modified cells to kill the cancer. It does this by engineering my cells to attack protein markers which my cancer highly expresses. While there are no guarantees in the medical world, we believe this is the missing link to curing my cancer. It is extremely difficult to get into these clinical trials and I am beyond fortunate that my cells, blood typing, and protein markers match perfectly with the study.Due to travel expenses, lodging, food, and the medical expenses, this treatment could cost 50,000 dollars or more. That is why I am looking for your help. This treatment is the next (and hopefully final) step in curing my cancer. I’m set to begin treatment December 12th of 2016, but will be asking for donations all December while I undergo my trial. Thank you so much for your love and generosity.I have much to do in this world, and my destiny is to be here for a long, long time. I look forward to the opportunity to get back to school, become a physical therapist where I can help people suffering from medical ailments as I have every day, marry my girlfriend, and so much more. Thank you to everyone who believes in me in these endeavors, my friends I have made along the way, and to those who can help me to reach my aspirations. I love you all so much, and couldn’t do it without you.-John KeimigTo read more about my story, visit my blog:   https://johnsdestructionofcancerplan.wordpress.com/2016/12/07/the-jist-of-it/",6762723641d90f0431d68c1e4838d658,29,0.6706,750.0,2,1,0,0,2,0,1,0.0,0.0028208744710860366,0.09521331945889698,0.0,2.0,0,1,0,0,Journey,gofundme

My husband and partner of over 33yrs, Glen, was recently diagnosed with colon cancer. Unforunately, cancer is no stranger to us. We have both been battling cancers of various degrees for the past 17 years. Although we have fought and survived thus far,  it has taken its toll both emotionally and financially. Unbelievably, this makes our 4th fight against a major cancer since October, 2000. While Glen and I have the love of God and our family helping us endure this emotional nightmare, we are financially drained & DESPERATELY NEED NEED YOUR HELP! I am, and have been, Glen’s only caregiver and he has been mine. At this point, we are the walking wounded trying to hold each other up. We need help financially so we can fight and win this battle. The co-payments and medical bills keep piling up, as Medicare only covers so much. Social Security is our only income, and that barely covered our basic necessities before this new cancer. Our Savings is gone. The financial burden has just become too much. We are not in the habit of asking for help and feel embarrassed to have to ask for your help now, but we are at a loss of what to do or where to turn. Gofundme.com is our last resort. We have a long road to travel, and we are very tired. I am hoping that the kindness and generosity of others can help us survive and  lift us from this overwhelming situation and show us that we are not alone in this fight.

Mum will begin her first chemotherapy session in a few weeks, followed by many others over the next 6 months.This disease has rocked a family that never saw it coming, and has touched so many friends and family who surround them.

Pineoblastoma is an aggressive, cancerous tumor that can spread to the spinal cord through the spinal fluid. This cancer is both responsive and resistant to treatment. So the doctor's plan is to fight it aggressively.Because of its aggressive nature, they will also need to do Chemotherapy and radiation in an effort to eradicate the remaining tumor and to rid her body of cancer.  Sydney, her husband Matt, and her family are in good spirits and are faithful they are in good hands, but this process is in its very beginning stages of a severe diagnosis. They are at the start of a battle that is going to be very difficult.She will have another spinal tap and an MRI of her middle and lower spine to make sure it hasn't spread. Then they will begin treating her entire central nervous system through both cranial spinal irradiation and chemotherapy. She will have the radiation and one type of chemo once a week for six weeks, as well as another type of chemo that will be administered 5 days a week over the same six week period. Then, after a 4 week break, they will re-scan her neck and spine to reassess. But for now, the plan is to administer three different chemo treatments every 6-8 weeks back-to-back for six months. Hopefully she will be done with treatments about 10 months from now. Then follow-up scans every two months for a while.As help to Sydney and her family I am beginning an effort to help irradiate any  additional stresses from their lives. The most immediate and pressing challenge is an attempt to preserve her eggs before the chemotherapy begins. Her endocrinologist explained that trying to conceive a few years after the chemo treatments, it will be possible but there are more odds against successful conception and her fertility window will be about 10 years more narrow. In other words, menopause will be expected in her early 40’s rather than her early 50’s. By preserving some healthy eggs now, she will have a better chance of having a few children later. Unfortunately, insurance does not cover fertility expenses of any kind. She qualifies for financial assistance through the LiveStrong Foundation, which covers the cost of the medications in this process. However, the balance of the cost is $5,500 which is expected to be paid right away.The additional funds raised here will help pay for medical procedures, any bills Sydney and Matt have including school, apartment, etc., and will help fund them in a time where Sydney will obviously not be working and Matt will be limited in the amount of time he can work as he is by his wife's side. Sydney, Matt, and the whole family are incredible people who were there for me when I was diagnosed with Leukemia just as they have been there for anyone else who has stood in need.

He was 18 years of age at the time. The CT scan immediately after the seizure showed that there was an area of calcification in the brain. He was told that the calcification was probably caused  by a vein that had burst when he was a child, and that this was the likely cause of the seizure. A MRI scan a few days later revealed that Greg had a brain tumour which must have originated from the calcification. On the 1st of June 2018 Greg had brain surgery. The tumour was debulked and sent for pathology analysis. The pathology results revealed that Greg had a grade 3 Anaplastic Ganglioglioma. Greg started radiation and chemotherapy on the 11th of July 2018 for a period of six and a half weeks. After a break of 4 weeks, he commenced the next round of chemotherapy.  On the 13th of September 2018, a MRI scan was done to evaluate the effectiveness of the radiation and chemotherapy treatments. The scan revealed that it looked as if the tumour had increased in size, but he was advised that it may be a false progression because of possible swelling post Radiation treatment. It was decided to wait 2 months for another MRI scan. This scan was done on the 12th of November 2018 which verified that the Radiation and Chemotherapy treatment had not worked and that the tumour had increased significantly in size.Greg underwent aggressive brain surgery on the 23rd of November 2018 (a day after his 19th birthday) to remove as much of the tumour as possible. Despite the surgeons best attempt to remove the tumour in its entirety, because of the nature of the tumour, not all of it could be removed.With few options, and no guarantee that other Chemotherapy treatments will work, and after much research and talking to other people who have overcome or are fighting Cancer, it has been deemed that the best course of treatment, would be for Greg to attend a Cancer Clinic in Thailand where he will receive individualised integrative Cancer Treatments enabling him to fight the tumour from a number of medical and  natural fronts.The treatment in Thailand is envisaged to be 8 weeks in duration, and as such will be very expensive.",5c73ffc791b85b33e89d59fc314be43c,15,0.9740333333333333,23.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Kate left QPS a few years ago to work as an investigator for Education NSW and to be closer to her family.

There are a multitude of photos of Kate and her adorable Max on facebook all depicting a very happy little family living a very normal and busy life.However things changed very recently when Kate noticed a lump in her left breast in early December 2018.  She went to her GP who said it was unlikely to be cancer. Thankfully this doctor said “I don’t muck around with boobs” and Kate was very quickly referred for a mammogram and ultrasound.  Those scans showed that her GP was right, the lump Kate had felt wasn’t cancer, but another lump was found, but one which Kate could not feel. Later a biopsy showed it was cancer!!At that time the scans indicated the cancer was 1.1cm and at that size, Kate was told it wouldn’t have spread to the lymph nodes, and that after surgery she would only require radiation. But unfortunately that wasn’t to be the case as the cancer, once removed, was 3cm and the two biopsied lymph nodes showed .5 cm cancers in each of them.  This changed treatment drastically and Kate’s prognosis fell from 98% to 70% survival.Just last week Kate had a full lymph node removal, a far more significant operation and recovery.  She has had to obtain private treatment so far, as her GP couldn’t get her in to see a public surgeon until mid January (even with a diagnosis early in December).  Had Kate not had private health and some savings she may still have been waiting to see a surgeon. Where would that have left her?Anyway two surgeries later Kate is now recovering from the second surgery so that she is able to commence a 6 month treatment of chemotherapy.  All things going to plan Kate will hopefully starting treatment early/mid February. Once that is completed Kate needs 6 weeks of daily radiation followed by 5 years of hormonal treatment. This will bring on menopause and all those other fun symptoms!!Kate is now forced to take leave for most of 2019.  She does have income insurance, and will be paid 75% of her income, but as a part time worker (75% of 0.6), the reality is that she is going to really struggle financially.  The medication she needs as well as caring for Max and normal bills are more than she can manage. Her savings have been used to pay the excess of private health. Nothing comes cheaply these days.Max turns 3 this March and as a single mum Kate would be very grateful for any help, that people can provide.  We need to raise funds to take the pressure and worry away from Kate so that she can focus on her recovery, mothering, her treatments and getting well!!Please donate any amount you can to help Kate.",df4db750c6ae7d352aac984f026bd97a,28,0.3248333333333333,12.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

She is the most true and individual person I know. She never sugarcoats anything. She is the type of person that people are easily drawn to. If she cares about you, you know it and she tries hard to make those in her life feel loved and respected. She worked in the construction industry for over 20 years. Once her sons became adults and moved out, she chose to pursue a lifelong dream of becoming a Delta flight attendant.  A feat not many 44 year olds would take on. She moved out of the comfort zone of her small hometown of Goldsboro, NC to Brooklyn, NY rented an apartment there with another flight attendant and began the jet-setting stylish lifestyle that suits her personality perfectly! For three short years, she traveled the world, flying for Delta, meeting new people, making new friendships and enlightening the lives of those she met everywhere. On Wednesday, July 12, 2017, my sister went to see an ENT in Atlanta for what she thought was a persistent sinus infection that hadn't responded to antibiotics. This was not what my family considers abnormal for her as she has suffered from allergies and sinus infections all her life. An x-ray was performed of her sinus cavities and because my sister is a talker, her head moved and the x-ray technician saw something that troubled him. He called in a doctor and before 7 pm EDT, the doctors determined that she had a baseball sized tumor in her right frontal lobe. It was surreal and all of it was happening so fast! They started prepping her for emergency surgery almost immediately. Luckily they didn't have an ER available that night, which gave my mother time to fly with Julia's youngest son down to Atlanta to be with her. On Thursday, July 13, after almost 3 hours in surgery, the doctors told my mother that they were able to get the whole tumor, indicating that it was most likely malignant, however testing to be sure might not be complete until the next week. We knew that her team of doctors probably had in their mind the diagnosis before we heard it. These are men and women who do this everyday, but we all were on pins and needles all weekend wondering and worrying about what it might be. On Monday, July 17 we learned that my sister had the mother of all brain cancers, glioblastoma. What the heck?? None of us could even pronounce it, much less spell it, but look it up we did. Let me advise anyone reading this, don't do that. You'll lose sleep and precious time. It's bad. It's not curable, but we hope with every fiber that her lifespan is much longer than what is written on Google. We hope and pray that she is with the best team of doctors that will get her into every trial out there currently being used to treat this monster. She is special and an individual. I hope that they find an immunotherapy course of treatment that will make her the next medical miracle. The hometown hero that survives this. Meanwhile, she begins standard treatment of 6 weeks of radiation and 6 months of chemo. We have spoken with two patients that we have been put in contact with who have given us a heads up on what's next and what we can expect. Most of it is typical: hair loss, fatigue and then the scary ones: imbalance, instability, forgetfulness, slurred speech. Our family is spread out all over the world and every member is as individual and independent as anyone in one family can be, but we all share the same faith that Julia's steadfast resolve and attitude that this cancer will not get the best of her. What we also all agree on is that she's going to need help from strangers. For obvious reasons, she will not be released for work until after her initial treatments and she is required to maintain her apartment in NY because when she does return, she will still be based out of that area. Her first hospital bill showed up before she arrived home. $113K and that was just the stay alone. We expect more from all the different doctors she saw while at Piedmont. In addition, we know that her chemo is over $1000 a month. Her insurance will not cover everything that she is responsible for and we are asking for help to get through this burden towards healing and back in the sky on a Delta plane as soon as she can. That's where she wants to be and that's where she shines the brightest. Simply saying ""thank you"" to all of you reading this is not enough. It will never be enough. But knowing that you are helping a mother and grandmother through the most difficult thing she may ever face in her short 47 years is humbling. Our family is so grateful and thankful for everyone reading and sharing this. We will be forever in your debt and will strive to pay it forward in our own lives.",2ab2a115b316fa8605dbabd53e506023,48,0.11416,540.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

The doctor was concerned that it could possibly be her gallbladder so he sent her for a CAT Scan. He came back and told her that they noticed 2 masses on her Liver and needed another CAT Scan with contrast. The doctor confirmed that she indeed did have 2 masses and was going to send her home and refer her to a specialist . On Monday, November 6th the specialist called and wanted to see her. She was told she had Stage 4 Colon Cancer that had metastasized to the Liver. Her whole world was turned upside down, we were NOT expecting that news.

My brother, Dharam, now 23, has special needs. He has cerebral palsy, global developmental delay, seizure disorder, traumatic brain injury, Raynaud’s syndrome, requires 24 by 7 care, and has had a stroke. My father, mother, and I have cared for him for the last 23 years by ourselves, without any help.  My name is Nikita, I am 20, and a student at UCLA,  on scholarships, working to get my B.A. in Psychology by 2019. My dad, Ram, has had severe back pain for the last few months, (we thought it was regular back pain from carrying my brother), that had gotten progressively worse, with other symptoms manifesting. Due to our family's unique and difficult circumstances, we barely make ends meet each month, with help from family, friends, and our church. On June 1st, 2017, my father who is only 52, was diagnosed with Stage 3 Multiple Myeloma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer. His bone marrow is packed with malignant plasma cells, which caused a multitude of lesions and minute fractures in his spine and ribcage. He is presently in a lot of pain and can no longer help care for my brother, who he is very attached to. My father has always been the rock of my family, and without him, it would be hard for any of us to function. He has a very challenging road ahead of him with many months of chemotherapy and radiation.Because this type of cancer is aggressive, so is the treatment. To stand a fighting chance, my dad also requires high dose Chemotherapy, Radiation, and Auto Transplant in a hospital, and we are overwhelmed by how expensive the treatment can be. My dad is the most God-fearing, selfless, and hilarious man. He is my inspiration and surely a role model and mentor to many. Those that know him have had the good fortune to first handedly experience his kindness, generosity, and self-sacrificing nature. Our family really needs my father around and this diagnosis knocked the wind out of our sails.The treatment for multiple myeloma has advanced greatly in the past ten years. Doctors are optimistic that at my father’s young age, with this treatment, he has a very good chance at remission. You can help my father access this much-needed treatment and help him battle for his life, by donating and sharing this post with others. It doesn’t matter how small or large, every donation helps. It is with heavy hearts and utmost humility, that our family is reaching out to all of you for your prayers, love, and much needed support.All donations will go directly to Urs family to assist with uninsured medical expenses, travel and treatment, to allow our family to focus our energy on beating Cancer.

Thank you, everyone, for being so compassionate About two weeks ago now,  Tigre was transported from the Miami Dade Animal Shelter to my home in Connecticut. We had raised a significant amount of pledges for her through people in the various dog facebook groups, but she had no interest. Pleas were send out by MDAS to rescues but none stepped up for her. The next step for Tigre, who had been seized by Animal Control when they went to pick up the dead dog she had been living with for two and one half weeks because she was in such bad shape, would have been ""humane euthanization."" I could not let that happen to this senior girl.Tigre is being treated for a long standing yeast infection in both of her ears, so bad that the skin has toughened. She has a large area of bacterial infection on her chest. And,  she is  underweight. Her most serious issue is cancer of the the mammary glands on the right side of her belly. If these glands are not removed, just as in women with breast cancer, the cancer will most likely metastasize. In dogs, the most common area/organs to which mammary cancer metastasizes is in the chest. I have received an estimate from my vet for the removal of the glands. It is very high. I will post the estimate.  I am presently treating the yeast and bacterial infection and working to get Tigre's weight up. That is not difficult. I am not, however, in the financial position to pay the $2700 needed for the surgery. To forgo having it done means that in all likelihood the mammary cancer will spread. That cannot happen. She deserves a chance at a happy healthy life, especially after the horror and lack of care she endured at her previous owners. To have the surgery done, Tigre and I must rely on the kindness of dog loving strangers and friends.  As they say, it all adds up.

As you know, Pam has just completed her third bout with metastasized breast cancer. The chemo was brutal but it did its job. While it was so hard on her body, we are so very grateful that the chemo once again repressed the cancer. Your incredible outpouring of prayers, phone calls and blessings has been the most important part of her healing. They have helped her keep her radiant smile and tremendous courage.Now, she needs to build up her immune system, body strength and muscle tone. She’s on a very limited pension and my sisters and I want her to eat organic foods and vitamins and get some holistic health care to restore and rebuild. She has no savings, so we’d love to give her a fund that she can draw from to pay for these treatments. This fund will allow her to afford the food and treatments she needs in this next chapter of her life.Our goal is $7000. A gofundme account allows Pam to access the donations to pay for these much needed treatments. There is a $0.30 fee added to your donation to offset the cost of using credit cards. If you would like to add this to your amount, we would be grateful. Also, feel free to share this on your Facebook page, so it can reach others who might be interested in supporting Pam. Pam has been a pastor for 36 years, where she has always made it her mission to be inclusive in her ministry. She welcomed all and created a powerful community wherever she served.  She won an award for her work with human rights from the Virginia Beach Human Rights Council in 2015.If you have been inspired or touched by Pam the way her family, friends and members of her church have, please join us in this communal effort to support her. We believe she still has work to do on this earth, sharing her wisdom and love through her writing and through supporting and loving her family and friends. Her daughter and son-in-law have recently welcomed their first child.

https://www.gofundme.com/ian-stevens,Fund Ian Stevens Stage IV Lung Cancer treatment,2018-12-21,12.0,2018.0,54758.0,100000.0,478.0,114.55648535564853,949,"The headlinesHere are just a few of the things we had no idea about just three weeks ago, but sadly are all too acutely aware of right now:Ian has  Stage 4 Cancer – the really bad kind. There are drugs that can help him manage it – the really expensive kind.And that’s where you come in – the really, well, very kind kind.      The backgroundAll things considered, Ian’s 42nd birthday won’t go down as one of his best. Having been feeling unwell with bronchitis-like symptoms since September 2018, and being diagnosed with pneumonia a month later, that morning, November 28, he asked his wife, Nina, if she’d take him back to Urgent Care. The plan was simple: to get another round of antibiotics to finally knock this pneumonia on the head, so he’d be well enough to travel back to the UK for a Christmas spent with friends and family after spending the last two in their new home in LA. That was the plan. What actually happened would, in fact, turn both their lives on their head. Ian and Nina both now owe a great deal to Urgent Care’s Dr Monica Separzadeh who, after ordering another X-ray, insisted Ian go straight for a CT scan. She then called some hours later to say she’d seen a mass on Ian’s left lung and that he and Nina should go to ER immediately. Like we said earlier, this wasn’t exactly the direction Ian had seen his birthday going in...Five days later, the biopsies came back to show that Ian has Stage IV, Non Small Cell Lung Cancer. (The location of the lung tumor turned out to be in the centre of his lung, meaning it was blocking the pneumonia infection in his left lung that had been causing his symptoms all along.) A brain MRI then showed that the cancer had spread, to six tumors in his brain.The news came as a huge shock for someone as healthy and strong as Ian and they were completely floored.The causeAfter some molecular profiling of the tumor, it was discovered that Ian has a rare genetic mutation called ALK; a mutation that can cause lung cancer in non-smokers and young people and that also – because presumably it isn’t the world’s most stupid mutation already, or maybe because it’s going for some sort of special award for A**hole Mutation Of The Year or something – commonly means it spreads to the brain. Only 3% of all people diagnosed with Ian’s type of lung cancer have the mutation. The scienceThe ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) mutation is a rearrangement in a gene that codes an abnormal protein called tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinases are enzymes (proteins) that act as chemical messengers, sending signals to the cells’ growth centre and, in this case, dictate the growth of Cancer.The exciting thing about this discovery is that now some Cancers can be treated with drugs that block tyrosine kinase and inhibit the growth of the cancer by blocking the signals that tell the cell to divide. They essentially control the Cancer’s “on-off” switch. This is called ‘targeted therapy’ and is less destructive on healthy cells than chemotherapy. The drug Alectinib (Alecensa) has been recommended by Ian’s oncologist as an urgent first route as it has promising results in crossing the blood-brain barrier (unlike traditional lung cancer drugs) meaning Ian may not need radiation therapy on his brain. This would be the preferred route given all the potential degenerative side-effects from radio surgery.The PathIan and Nina have been seeking advice from leading experts in the UK as well as their adopted home in California. Ian is very lucky to have some of the best Doctors for his condition treating him and to live in a place at the cutting edge of lung cancer research.The moneyThis treatment is very new and is a positive step amidst a background of lung cancer treatments that haven’t increased survival significantly in the last several decades.However, it is also very expensive – $15,000 per month – and is not fully covered by insurance. This is something Ian will have to take every day for the rest of his life.The futureIan will be monitored every two weeks, with regular scans to check the progress of the tumors. Like all drugs, the cancer cells will become resistant to prolonged use. But, this is one of the most promising times in lung cancer and if and when they become resistant, Ian’s doctors are confident there will be new treatments and trials for Ian to try. The manLook, the truth is that he’s a Tottenham Hotspur fan. So it’s not like the guy is perfect. But if you know Ian, you’ll know why he’s so important. You may know him as The Steves, Eens, Cousin Ian, Uncle Ian, the Maverick, Big Bear, proud husband and Godfather.You’ll also likely know that he’d be the first person to help you if the shoe was on the other foot.If you’ve never had the pleasure to meet Ian, chances are you’ve probably loved his work over the years, given that he’s the multiple-award-winning Creative Director behind some of the most iconic magazine covers the world has ever seen, on magazines like Empire, Q, Top Gear and very many more. Today, Ian lives in Los Angeles with his loving wife Nina. He's the Patrick Star to her Spongebob and from tomorrow, with your help, he’s starting their fight back.

Both Maimoides and Sloan Kettering Cancer centers have said that a prostectomy is the only way to go.

At the moment I am dealing with getting my insurance to cover the out of network doctor. Once that’s done a date for the surgery will be picked. According to both surgeons I will be unable to work or work out for 6-8 weeks after the surgery. I am grateful and feel super lucky to have this doctor and recovery team helping me through this. Obviously it will be difficult learning to hold my bladder again and dealing with whatever impact this procedure may have on my loving abilities. I’m also pretty stressed about what I will be able to do about my bills during this recovery time, being that I wont be able to work as a camera man or actor. For this reason I am starting this second wave of donations to make it through this time. Don’t crazy everyone, Yes I acted in a TV show but that shit wasn't network, so I’m not rich or anything close to it. I have made it a bit more than halfway to my goal.

At age 35 this is extremely rare.  (Almost all patients are older than 45. About two-thirds are at least 65 years old. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 71).  We’ve seen 2 different oncologists through Kaiser and felt their treatment plan just wasn’t a right fit. After calling pretty much every major cancer center in the US we ended up meeting with a GI oncologist at Stanford and really liked what he had to say. So, we’re choosing to start a trial at Stanford that Kaiser does not offer. We feel that the best chance to beat this aggressive cancer is with the best, at Stanford. We’ve decided on a treatment plan and hope to get it started in the next week or so. The outpouring of love and support has been nothing short of amazing. I know we have a long hellish road ahead but he’s strong and with the strength of our village I know we’ve got this.

His ability to bring laughter to any situation is beyond words. If you need useless trivia or unusual facts, you can always depend on Kyle to inform or entertain you. ￼Kyle and Jenn met through a mutual friend and knew from the very beginning they were meant to be together. Marrying a short time later at the young ages of 20 and 21 the sky was the limit. Shortly after they were married Jenn’s mom passed away and being the selfless people they are, they took on the responsibility of raising Jenn’s little sister Destani (age 5 at the time, now 18) as their own. Just babies themselves they were determined to make it work together. Kyle started his law enforcement career with the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office, after 3 years there he transferred to the Pleasanton Police Department where he has worked to serve and protect and lay his life on the line daily for the last 10 years. Kyle has made many friends along the way but has said his favorite thing about his job is interacting with the community and making people laugh. ￼Zoey (11) and Cohen (9) are Jenn and Kyle’s biological children and their daddy is the light of their lives. But it doesn’t stop there. Kyle lost his brother three years ago to a heart condition and are now raising their niece Alyssa (17) as their own as well. Their hearts are as pure as gold.  ￼Most of their free time is spent with friends that are family. From camping and fishing, to Sunday BBQ’s or just random get togethers. Friends and family are always near. ￼The Henricksen family has always been very giving and put the needs of their family, friends, and loved ones first. It’s our turn to give back to them. There are many people who have asked how they can help, and we all know that medical bills will be very high. 100% of all monies raised will be given to the Henricksen family to be used wherever needed. Kyle is determined to beat this. And we know that the village that surrounds him will be there every step of the way. Here is a small video to make you smile. Zoey and Kyle staying positive. -and a true picture of his fun loving personality. ￼Jenn and Kyle are overwhelmed by the amount of love and support our village has shown them in such a short amount of time. The road will be long and hard, but we will never leave their sides.

A few weeks later she had it looked at and her doctor told her it was probably just a  torn muscle. Over the next couple months it grew bigger and became more painful. In November, her doctor decided they should do an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed she had a 2inch mass in her muscle. The doctor had ""never seen anything like it."" While her doctor was baffled, the mass grew even more. On December 24th, she had an MRI which showed a large mass entwined in the muscle. The radiologist was the first person to take it seriously and recommended she get this taken care of right away.  This led to a biopsy of the mass to see exactly what she was dealing with.After some hurdles Tiffany was then sent to see Dr. Hayden, a surgeon specialized in the removal of sarcomas. He is the one to initially look at the chest scans and is also the one to break the news that the mass in her arm was indeed cancerous. Dr. Hayden didn't want to waste anytime and scheduled the surgery a couple of weeks after the confirmation.The tumor in the arm was removed on January 29th and officially stated as a 'High Grade Undifferentiated Sarcoma with Epithelioid'. Everything went well and the doctor came back with clear margins (no sign of cancer). Considering Tiffany was pregnant still there was zero chance the doctors wanted to take the risk with chemo/radiation so this is all that was done at this point. She then went into recovery mode for the next 5 months healing up to the best of her ability. There was a decent amount of functionality loss in the arm and doing even the simplest of tasks are extremely difficult.This takes us to now, or about a month ago. Tiffany had to get scans done of her arm and her chest again. This is a pretty common practice when you have cancer as they just want to make sure it hasn't returned. It had. The arm came back clear, which is good considering it was the place of origin, but the chest scan showed a spot on the lung. Tiffany is now preparing for yet another operation, the surgery will be on July 9th and she along with her family will be gone for close to 2 weeks in Portland while she recovers.This fund is set up to help ease the stress of the financial burden that comes with the traveling 600 miles back and forth between Portland, the hotel expensives that come along with that, medical costs that may arrise, and loss of income that Kris will have from being away.

Cancer, to all of us is an ugly word that we sympathize with when we hear it, we cringe when we hear a loved one has it and we mourn if they pass. I have known Nona and Ovi Taut for the better of seven years, we have shared joys, memories, pain and blessings together. Over that time they have become some of my dearest friends and quite quickly family. Nona is my sister in law, my wife’s best friend and even happened to become my neighbor. She grew up a Christian woman, married her first love and endured 13 long years of not being able to have a baby. Five years ago, God answered their prayers and blessed them with a beautiful baby girl, Victoria. But, two years ago…. When life seemed to perfect, beautiful and simple…. Cancer came knocking. Nona is 39 years old, she was diagnosed with Stage 4 Adenocarcinoma, better known as stomach cancer that has spread to many other parts of her body. Through her journey she has battled and fought a valiant fight. She has endured Chemo therapy, radiation and even the removal of her stomach, pancreas and other organs. After endless months in the hospital, hundreds of tests, countless sleepless nights and a pain that one can only understand when this storm is truly upon them. Only God knows what his will is and how long our lives last. The challenge that they now face is more daunting than any person can truly imagine. The medical system in this country is so broken that an illness like this not only can take a person’s life, but leave a trail of ruin for all of those behind. THE MEDICAL AND LIVING DEBTS  WHICH THEY OWE AFTER INSURANCE AND THE BATTLE OF CANCER IS NEARING 250,000 THOUSAND DOLLARS AND GROWING WITH WEEKLY ER VISITS AND TREATMENTS.  DAY TO DAY LIFE IS HARD, BILLS DON'T STOP.OVI was and is the sole provider. He has spent his entire life helping those around him giving and extending hands of help with a heart of a true servant of the lord. Many of the people who may see this could attest for his heart. IN THIS TIME OF NEED, I am starting this GOFUND me to help them. This money will be raised to help with all of the mounting bills that have become so daunting one cannot begin to fathom AND TO SETTLE MEDICAL DEBT ONCE ALL GRANTS ARE APPLIED FOR…. We will fight to apply for different grants, programs and charity programs to help this family persevere through this time and the time to come. I pray that God helps us achieve a miracle with this page and at least conquer something we can control. If your heart feels pressed I ask you to pledge whatever you can.

The treatments have been keeping the Cancer at bay but this is a long-term fight.  Didi recently suffered an additional setback that resulted in the discovery of a brain tumor in which she had a very intense 5 hour brain surgery procedure.  We feel very blessed for the success of this surgery.  Modern medicine is amazing! But it took its toll on her and has led to follow-up focused radiation treatment.  In addition to the set back of her Brain Tumor, she lost her Kaiser insurance through Obama Care.  This delayed her continued treatment. She has since found new doctors and a new facility to administer her immunotherapy in Santa Cruz.  Didi continues to suffer from incapacitating headaches that have rendered her immobile. Her fight against Cancer has taken its toll on her ability to regularly work, keep up with the medical bills, and the cost of daily living.  Shannon, Didi’s husband has been working 6 days a week and doing what he can to keep things going but that isn't enough to cover the financial setbacks and ongoing medical costs.  They are both overwhelmingly grateful for the help they have received to date but, unfortunately, more is needed.Fighting this Cancer is a long-term battle. But with the help of friends and community, we are confident she can beat it!  So, with some convincing, Didi has finally accepted that it is time to reach out to all of her friends, family, and community. Didi is not only an asset to all of us who know her well, but she has always been kind, generous, and an inspiration to the greater community at large, including the homeless and the mentally ill. We hope that generosity comes back to her now in her time of greatest need.   So, we are reaching out to all of you and asking for your support.  Please do what you can.  In addition to any monetary contribution you are able to donate, your loving positive vibes are always welcomed and greatly needed.  Please share and pass on to others in your community as well.  We need you to help this amazing gift of life that is our Didi get through this every day!!

Just before my 50th birthday I was scrolling Facebook and I saw an ad for an upcoming free breast cancer screening event at St Joseph Mercy Hospital. Being self-employed my insurance history was spotty and I had not yet had my first mammogram. I saw the ad and was inspired to sign up for the event. At that time, I was the first participant where cancer was found since the event began 4 years prior. It was truly a blessing and I know that I would not have had that screening or learned that I had breast cancer if I had not responded to that Facebook ad. I truly believe that I have been touched by God's grace. 2017 was a whirlwind a year. I had a lumpectomy where the cancer was removed and it was determined that it had not spread to the rest of my body. I underwent six weeks of radiation. In the fall of 2017 I began hormone suppression therapy. 2018 was a different story  Since I was uninsured at the time of my cancer diagnosis my husband and I are responsible for the bills that were incurred. St Joseph Mercy Hospital was generous in reducing our bill by 74% this still left a remaining $30,000 that we were responsible for. A payment plan was set up and we were able to make payments through most of 2018. Unfortunately, I did not respond well to the hormone suppression therapy. The side effects of the medications were crippling and as a direct result my income has decreased by more than 50% for the year 2018. The next steps for my health require trying a different course of hormone suppression medications. At the end of last year I honestly considered foregoing any further treatment in order to reduce our expenses. We are still waiting to see if our unsubsidized ACA bronze insurance plan will approve the new therapies.  I remain hopeful, I am in the palm of God's hand. It is with great humility that we ask for help.  I continue to work, I've been on a ""medication vacation"" since October and my energy levels have tripled. I'm working diligently and I've taken on a second job in order to stay afloat. My husband works every available shift, sometimes working 15 days straight with one day off. He is such an incredibly wonderful partner. It has been very difficult this last year feeling that I was unable to equally contribute.

Her name is Rita and she is the biggest sweetheart. Her favorite thing to do is play ball and cuddle anybody who will let her. She howls when she's excited and wants nothing but love and affection.

Rita was my boyfriend's dog. His name is Dane and he had her since the day she was born and she was the biggest daddy's girl you could ever meet. Unfortunately, Dane passed in July 2017 and I have taken it very hard. I have had anxiety and depression my entire life and when Rita and Dane came into my life, they made things better and loved me either way. She is the biggest support to me in ways I could never put into words. She has a way of calming me that I could not imagine life without.

I have been making sure Rita is happy and healthy since his passing, but she has now been diagnosed with liver cancer. Something that could not have been prevented unless I had done an ultrasound on her, which there was no sign indicating that she needed to have one done. The vet is confident that if she has the surgery, it will add years to her life. If she does not get the surgery, it's likely that she will pass away or need to be put down before the year is over. At any moment, she could start uncontrollable bleeding, which will either cause her death itself or force me to put her down. Rita is in every other way as healthy as can be and you can't even tell by looking at her that she has cancer. She shows me unconditional love and strength. 

I have put down two dogs this year (due to diseases) and lost my best friend since 4th grade just three weeks ago. I can not lose another love. Rita is my registered emotional support dog. I am begging you to help me raise money for her surgery. 

The surgery is about $3,500 but I am asking for $4,000  to help compensate for the fees that come with GoFundMe. She will also need ultrasounds every 3-6 months to make sure the tumour doesn't come back. So any additional donations are immensely appreciated as well and will be used towards her health. I have spent $1,000 in the last 24 hours to get her diagnosed and I am unable to afford any additional expenses. The surgery needs to be done as soon as possible so I have no way of trying to earn that money on my own.

Please help me take care of my babygirl and keep her here with me. She is always right by my side. I can't even use the bathroom without her wanting to be right at my feet. I can not imagine life without her.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Alex is one of the most kindhearted, funny, beautiful and just an all around wonderful person. She's an amazing mother to 3 beautiful little kids! Adelin is 7, Adrienne is 6, and Deacon is 18 months. She's also a pretty awesome wife to David Obermeyer! She's also my best friend!Here is her story:On May 1st she started getting terrible migraines that could not be taken care of with any treatment she tried. They were so bad, that she couldn't even get out of bed most days. Finally on the 23rd her doctor sent her for a CT scan. The techs quickly informed her that she would be speaking to the doctor there and that her primary doctor wanted an MRI asap for a more detailed look. That was all before 10am. At 11:30ish on the same day she was being prepped for surgery to remove a ""large spot"" from her right frontal lobe. The surgery took 5 hours. She was monitored and released 3 days later with no information on what was really going on yet. A couple of days after surgery she got a notification of a test result on her hospital app. ( yes I said hospital app) From there is where she found out that she did indeed have a malignant tumor removed. She has what is called Glioblastoma IV. She is starting her treatment that will last 6 weeks and will be radiation and a chemo pill. The chemo pill alone is about $400 a piece. Anything you can do will be helpful! Obviously she can't work, so they are on one income, with 3 kiddos. This will help with medical treatment, groceries, and any other financial stress they will come across for the next however long it takes to beat this!

This rare form of cancer is often found in individuals who carry the sickle cell trait. Makayla had her kidney removed and has most recently been sent home today after a 4 week hospital stay for complications with swelling in her abdomen, a c diff infection and some other issues (the cancer is also in the lymphnodes of her abdominal area). Makayla has been very strong and is determined to beat this cancer. My sister Jessica (Makaylas mother) is an RN and has been very dedicated to her care. My sister Jessica and Makaylas father, Chuckie have been by Makaylas side every single day which means they have missed out on a lot of work and income. They also have two other children. Makayla will be requiring a lot of support while she is at home recovering and fighting this cancer. She will hopefully be starting the clinical trial Keytruda soon which looks promising.

I wish we could thank everyone personally but there is far to many but people know we are so thankful for every donation. I can safely say our fundraising goal has been SMASHED after The Green Eat  :)__________________________________________________________Yesterday was the final piece to the puzzle.Hannah will receive the highest dose of radiation to her skull and top of her spine. She will have to have 7 cycles of chemotherapy down in Brisbane.(one cycle is 4 weeks)-----------------------------------------------------------------------Final results from America have been confirmed today. Originally the lesion on Hannah's brain were considered to be one mass and was correctly diagnosed as Medulloblastoma.The third surgery confirmed the lesions were not connected and Hannah has two different types of brain tumor.1. A Medulloblastoma - this will not be removed and will be treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy commencing 7th of November.2 - Pilocyctic Astrocytoma (the tumour that was removed and is relatively benign but this will have to be monitered)Hannah is an amazing strong little lady to go through having one brain tumour, let alone 2.

I could not be more proud of her coming out 100% of all 3 surgeries and having a smile on her face all day everyday.I just want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart for the generosity, it is amazing.-----------------------------------------------We hadn't considered making this page but we have had several people enquire about us setting it up so they can support us, so here goes.This is a brief summary of story so far for those who don't already know.Hannah is a 13 year old girl from Rockhampton, who attends The Cathedral College, loves texting, McDonalds and going shopping.Hannah was suffering from bad headaches for weeks after several doctor vists and hundreds spent on medication, nothing was working.Hannah had an MRI on Friday 26th of August and there it was, our worst nightmare. A 2.5m x 2.5cm tumour in her cerebellum.Hannah, Leesa and Darren were all on a plane the following morning to meet Matthew & Myself in Brisbane. Hannah was admitted to Lady Cilento Children's Hospital.Hannah has now undergone three brain surgeries to have tissue samples and the tumour removed. This week she was diagnosed with a medulloblastoma, a malignant brain tumour. Hannah will be looking at 6 weeks of radiation in Brisbane, followed by 4-7 cycles of chemotherapy.Potentially 10 months away from our home in Rockhampton.A donation would help with expenses while away from home as several people have asked where and how they can donate. We would like to thank everyone who has helped us so far and will support us in Hannah's long journey ahead.Nicole Tarlington",386f824d1cbb4957b4096b4679256841,14,1.0351612903225806,840.0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Jess has gotten much worse in the last few weeks. She is incredibly weak, and has terrible double vision, vertigo, and dizziness. She has fallen a lot recently, and when she does, it is nearly impossible to get her back up. It has come to the point when I can no longer care for her at home. She is currently in the hospital and the plan is to move her to a hospice house where she can get 24 hour care. It kills me to do this since she hates hospitals, and Genevieve and I miss her terribly, but she is not safe at home anymore. I am in a no-win situation, but have to choose the lesser of two evils. I wish I had better news.”I’m posting this update on behalf of Tom & Jessica. I created this campaign last year for them, which has been incredibly helpful. As you may recall, with Jessica unable to work due to her cancer, they had to move to a smaller house. Last year’s donations were instrumental in letting them fix up their house to get ready to sell and to deal with all of the moving expenses. Unfortunately, as Tom has reported above, things have taken a turn for the worse for Jessica. She is now so weak, with vertigo, double-vision, and a host of other problems, that she can no longer live at home. As of this writing, she has been moved to hospice care. As you might imagine, Tom has had to take a lot of unpaid time off from work, and even with insurance, they are amassing a mountain of ridiculous medical bills. Like last time, they expect nothing, but are grateful for anything. Please share this link wherever you can so as many people see it as possible. You can donate anonymously if you so choose.Thanks again,Brett Lord*********************ORIGINAL CAMPAIGN STORY: Dear friends and family,This GoFundMe campaign is for Jessica Million, the wife of my old friend Tom Million, and mother of their young daughter, Genevieve.As you may or may not know, Jessica began a battle with breast cancer several months ago. She had surgery, and it was thought that the surgeons got everything.  Unfortunately, they recently learned that the cancer had metastasized into her spine, hips, lymph nodes and brain.  Although they are doing all they can, her prognosis is not favorable. Jessica currently has a lot of mobility issues, as well as nausea, dizziness and vertigo, so she can no longer drive. As a result, she has had to put aside her beloved landscaping career, so she and Tom are having much trouble making ends meet. They are definitely going to have to move to a smaller home, since they cannot afford their current one on Tom's income alone.  Of course, moving is not cheap. There are repairs that must be made before they put their home on the market and, despite insurance, the medical bills are piling up. They would rather not ask anyone for money, but they certainly need it.  Any amount is welcome, and they will certainly not think less of anyone who can't give at this time. They know they have the best friends in the world, and help doesn't always come in the form of money. You may give anonymously if you so choose. Please share this as much as you can. The more this goes viral, the more help they can get.

Bills are piling up as Richard (partner/father) has had to take a lot of time off. Britney had to give up her job to care for Zarah & has not been able to return to work since Zarah’s diagnosis. Please read their story below. “On October 18, 2016 our baby took a tumble off the bed and we were concerned about concussion or possible broken arm, little did we know it turned into something that would change our lives forever. We took our baby girl to the hospital to have X-rays done and to be checked over, that’s when I noticed a rash. I told the nurses my concern with the rash and the doctor came back in. It was petechia (which indicates low platelets). They did blood work and we waited. I can still hear the doctors that night “is this correct?!” And I heard her making hundreds of phone calls. “Should I tell them it could be that or should I wait for you”. The local peds doctor came in bright and early to explain to us what was found. Our baby had 10x higher amount of white blood cells and platelets were so low she was in a dangerous spot. That is when the Doctor explained to us my 15 month old baby girl probably had cancer. They needed to start iv fluids fast but her little veins were not cooperating, she was poked over 25 times that first day. We had to take the ambulance to Saskatoon right away and we were met with about 5 doctors. It was extremely overwhelming. With in days, bone marrow samples, blood work, platelets, blood transfusions etc. It came back our daughter was diagnosed with high risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and she started treatment immediately. The next days are a blur now, emotional, stressful, and depressing. Trying to figure out what we were going to do for our other children was one of our main concerns also. Where were we going to stay? How were we going to continue to pay for our needs? And the list went on. We are extremely thankful for the Ronald McDonald house here in Saskatoon, the house has became our second home, and most importantly all the workers and volunteers have became our second family! While Zarah had some of her harsh chemos we were not allowed to leave Saskatoon! Once Zarahs chemos slowed down we had finally got the ok to go home and checked out of RMH after 123 days! What a relief to get to our home! Life hasn’t been so grand, since Zarah was diagnosed she has faced many infections, viruses, and the latest appendicitis. But If can tell you all one thing, Zarah is one of the strongest, determined and so patient little girl I will ever know!Back in 2010 I was diagnosed with cervical cancer They did a LEEP surgery surgery, which removes the cancer cells from the cervics and I was ok just to go for my regular Pap smears up until 2016.I had missed my regular Pap smear as my main concern was my kids. September 2017, after fighting with my body with complications, heavy bleeding, blood clots and major pain I was able to get into a gynaecologist in Saskatoon! That is when we learned after my Pap smear, my worst fear, my cervical cancer had returned. My gynaecologist suggested that in my best interest, we should just do a hysterectomy...I’m 30 years old, having more kids wasn’t in my future, I just needed to be healthy for my family. So I waited for that surgery date. I’m now waiting to hear if I will be needing chemo treatments or the surgery did the trick and I will be ok! As a family we count our blessings every minute of the day because we just never know what is around the corner...”.

I know him since we were 12 years old. We grew up together in post-Soviet Union era, riding bikes over abandoned construction sites or fighting yobs together.Pasha is a man of heart, one of the most kind, caring and charitable person I ever have known. He has always been treating others how he wants to be treated. One of my few friends, who has carried our friendship through the whole life. Proud father of two adorable kids (Masha, 4 and Vanya, 7), beloved husband, brother and son supporting his aging parents. He is a worthy man, who deserves a life.4 years ago he was a successful entrepreneur running small-size trucking business in Moscow, Russia. 3 years ago he had to sell out most of his fleet, because Russian economy collapsed. 2 year ago he was diagnosed with a rare type of pancreas cancer with multiple metastases in liver. He committed to fight. Pasha underwent surgery (almost entire pancreas removed, except it’s head) and was prescribed expensive medication for conservative treatment of metastases. Surprisingly, all that helped beyond expectations: he has been feeling ok for 1.5 years and remaining tumors are growing very slowly. Pasha is “lucky” - his cancer hasn’t been as aggressive as usual.His family is spending $2000-3000 on monthly prescriptions. Pasha has been strong enough to master a new skill in construction: he sets up heating systems, but in spite of some income his family has run out of money. My friend is losing hope. He is about to give up. In fight with cancer giving up is the worst path.My goal is to raise $20000 to cover a year of continuous treatment and put together a plan for the next surgery.I will immensely appreciate your re-posts, as well as donations. Your help will let my best friend to continue the fight and not give up. My appreciation of your help goes beyond words. Thank you very, very much!----------in Russian------------Мой лучший друг детства борется с раком поджелудочной. Ему нужна сейчас финансовая помощь, чтобы купить себе немного времени и надежду. Его зовут Паша Оноприенко, мы друзья с 12 лет. Мы вместе росли в эпоху перестройки, катались на великах по заброшенным стройкам, отбивались от гопников, учились жизни.Паша - один из самых добрых, отзывчивых и душевных людей, которых я знаю.  Он относится к другим так, как хотел бы, чтобы относились к нему. Один из немногих друзей, для которых дружба - не пустой звук. Отец двух замечательных детей (Маша, 4 года и Ваня, 7 лет), любящий и любимый муж. Успешный предприниматель, который много лет давал работу десятку сотрудников. Достойный человек, который заслужил того чтобы жить.Четыре года назад у него был процветающий малый бизнес (грузоперевозки в Москве). Три года назад ему пришлось продать автопарк и закрыть бизнес из-за экономических проблем в России. Два года назад у него диагностировали рак поджелудочной со множественными метастазами в печень. Он прооперировался (вырезали всю поджелудочную, кроме головки), ему назначают дорогие лекарства для консервативного лечения метастазов. На удивление, все вместе помогает - Паша чувствует себя сносно уже больше полутора лет, метастазы растут медленно. Врачи сказали, ему “повезло” - рак не такой агрессивный, как обычно.Семья Паши тратит 200000 рублей в месяц только на лекарства. У Паши хватило сил открыть новый бизнес, он налаживает отопительные системы, но деньги нужны огромные. Я не хочу, чтобы мой друг сдался из-за денег.

Chuck is not only a brother, but he is also a hardworking and loving husband of 45 years to my sister-in-law Vicki, a father to four beautiful children, a grand-father/Poppy to twelve, a son, an uncle, a cousin, a nephew, and a faithful friend!

     Chuck has ALWAYS gone above and beyond to provide for his family, even if it meant going without himself. Chuck is a very talented artist, who is known for his woodwork in carpentry; most recently he served as a Superintendent for two major business buildings in Port Jervis. If you know Chuck, you know he is a very outspoken person, but at times like this he has ‘to much pride’. Due to this unfortunate circumstance, Chuck is unable to work and provide for his family. Chuck and Vicki don’t like having to ask for help, but if there was ever a time they need it, this is it. Those who know Chuck and his family know that they are still struggling with the devastating and unexpected loss of their 32 year old son Dominic.  Even at that most trying and tragic time, they did not seek help.

    Chuck was recently admitted and remains hospitalized three hours from his home at The West Chester Medical Center in Plains, NY, where he recently underwent emergency surgery to remove a large amount of fluid buildup around his heart. We all know that money won't change the outcome of  God's will, but unfortunately Chuck's battle has resulted in a huge financial cost including traveling cost, lost wages and daily living costs. These costs will only continue to accrue in the coming weeks and months. We are seeking your support during this challenging time in our much loved Chuck's life.

    Thank you for taking the time to read this. Even if a donation isn’t possible, please send prayers and positive thoughts to Chuck and his family. It would mean the world to me if you would share this.

    We know medical professionals do not decide our fate and that God is in charge! 

    Meanwhile Chuck WILL continue fighting this cancer!

Thank you again,

Lisa and the entire family of Chuck",ae55c077028157dd4b5a26e87166ef79,19,0.165,780.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I have been reading the comments and the names from this page to Jim and he has been so surprised at the out pouring of love and support from those he spent so much time with in the past. I know what a great person he is but sometimes it is hard to see it in ourselves. It has allowed him to go back and remember everyone with fondness and take his mind back in time. A time where so many friends and colleagues shared a common bond, I see now how strong that bond was and still is. Please post on the page a very big thank you to all.

Then we noticed a swell on her left knee, which after some five months of investigations was diagnosed to be a cancerous tumour – osteosarcoma. This is apparently a rare form of bone cancer and the paediatric form affects only a small group of children during their teenage growth spurts. We are blessed to have learnt that it is early stages yet and the tumour has not spread beyond the localised area.Due to its rare nature treatment options in Ghana, her home country, is limited to chemotherapy and amputation and so we are hoping to get treatment for her in a country where there is a lot more experience at managing Sarcoma. The least estimate we have received is $380,000 and this is what we are hoping to raise between our employers, our own resources, friends and any other kind-hearted persons or charities.We are so far overwhelmed with the support of friends and family by way of prayers and kind words and we are hoping that we can raise as much as we can materially to support her treatment as well. As you can imagine, as a family, we have no greater desire than to see that she gets the best treatment possible and restoration to a fully functional life. We are hoping to raise as much of these funds by end of the year to start the treatment.Please hold our hand and walk with us on this journey by donating as generously as you can.

Eileen was recently diagnosed with stage IV cancer. She is waiting to see a cancer specialist at the City of Hope Hospital which is scheduled for July 25th. Until she is able to see the specialist and learn more about what treatment options are available she is unable to work. As some of you know Eileen has 4 children whom she provides for, she will need to pay someone to care for them as we anticipate she will have many doctor visits in the near future. To better her health she has switched to an all natural organic diet with the help of her mom who visits our local farmers market and cooks her meals every week. Eating organic and purchasing all natural holistic remedies has become a financial stress on her entire family. With all of this being said please consider helping us raise funds to assist Eileen and her family with all the unplanned expenses. No gift is too small; please join us to get her the care she needs.

While I recovered from them, the unfortunate truth is that it will probably occur again at some point, but I digress... Today's concern is that we have just received nearly $7000 in ambulance fees that my insurance has determined they will not cover. We've already attempted to negotiate a lower amount with the ambulance company, but to no avail. So, once again, as much as I hate to, I turn to you for help.Anything that can be offered would be greatly appreciated, and a huge thank you in advance!----------------------------------------------Hi Everyone, It's StephanIt is with the heaviest of hearts that I post this update.On 2/17, my beautiful soulmate, Heather, had a seizure while we were attending a Doctor Who convention.After rushing her to the hospital, it was determined that the breast cancer we thought we had beaten has metastasized into her brain.None of us knows how much time Heather has left with us. But barring a miracle (which we are all praying for), it is the horrible truth that her time with us is limited.Before I ask you to help us again, I want to make something clear. Heather and I are not destitute, but we are by no means wealthy. Her treatment will be expensive, no doubt, but we can most likely handle it.The purpose of my appeal today is two-fold.1) Helping me give Heather the best days of her life. While are are going to be ok financially, we certainly don't have the kind of free capital to do much aside from getting her treated. If you know my wife, you know shes got a hell of a bucket list, and I would like to knock as many things as I can off that list.2) Giving people who want to do something, a meaningful way to contribute. When facing this grim reality, there isn't going to be much that any of you can do for us directly, but I know you all want to. Contributing to this fund would give you a clear and meaningful way to ""help"". Every single dollar contributed will go toward making sure we can make the most of the time we have with the love of my life, regardless of how long that might be.This is by far the most difficult thing I have ever had to write in my life. Please help me give my wife the future she deserves.----------------------------------------------Hello!First off, thank you for looking at our GoFundMe page.Our little family has recently received some bad news-Heather has been diagnosed with breast cancer. There are more tests to be done, but the doctors have identified malignant tissue in a breast lump and a lymph node, so she is definitely looking at 6 months of chemo, surgery, and radiation therapy. We expect the treatment to start within the next three months.Upon announcing this news, many of our friends and family have been asking how they can help. While it is too early to really know what kind of emotional/daily support we might need, we can say with certainty that, even with decent insurance, our finances are about to change significantly. Also, some of you also know that we have been saving our pennies for a down payment on a house (that we were hoping to buy early next year). Unfortunately, it looks like not only will our savings plan be put on hold, but the savings we have will have to be reallocated to keep us afloat while Heather is unable to work.Funds donated to us will first be used to pay medical bills, then living expenses/provide for our baby girl. Anything extra will go back toward refunding our home savings.  Any help that you can give will be greatly appreciated and a huge thank you in advance!",854c8118651b960a0460c0ac7002982e,20,0.46485714285714286,1080.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

These last few months have been nothing less than a parent's worst nightmare. Mike & Becky's only child MJ was just diagnosed with bone cancer. This comes shortly after Becky was let go from her job of 19+years, leaving them to solely rely on Cobra Insurance Coverage that ends in 16 months time and runs $2200 a month. No parent should ever have to worry about the cost of their child's medical expenses. We would like Becky and Mike to be able to concentrate 100% on MJ and his needs by easing some of the financial burden. Many people have asked how they can help. The best way to help at this time is by making a donation. Any amount will be greatly appreciated. We would also like to ask you to share this page with your family and friends...church groups, etc. Becky & Mike are the kind of people who will go out of their way to help friends and strangers alike. Let's join together and be there for Becky, Mike and MJ. ￼MJ's Last Few Months (shared by his mom Becky) In mid/late October 2017 MJ was experiencing pain in his thigh that got progressively worse throughout each day and then started fresh the next morning. Eventually it reached the point that even when lying down, he was in excruciating pain - literally screaming. That night even though we felt silly we took him to a standalone ER for thigh pain. I told her that he had a fever before we came if that was relevant and she said he did not have a fever, that body temp goes up at night. They moved his hip around, did an X-ray, and reported that they couldn't see any issues causing the pain. They offered a CT scan and blood work but said the CT scan would be a lot of radiation and if it were something that would be caught on a CT scan there would be other symptoms. So we agreed not to do the CT scan but I requested blood work. The doctor said that if we weren't doing to CT Scan there was no reason to do blood work. So we were released and told to follow up with our pediatrician, which we did the next day. Our pediatrician checked MJ over and since she didn't find anything concerning she ruled the problem to be small muscle tears. She told him to take it easy. The pain did pass in a few days, for about a week, but then returned. We called the pediatrician who referred us to an orthopedic doctor. The ortho moved him around, took an X-ray, and said it happened because he needed to stretch before physical activities, and diagnosed him with tendinitis of the knee (yes knee?). After a week or two of no improvement and in fact worse pain, and after multiple calls to the ortho asking if they were sure, they referred us to physical therapy. We owe so much to the physical therapist. It was fairly obvious to me that she knew something more serious was wrong throughout her examination. When she finished her evaluation she tactfully told us that there was something more going on and that we needed to go back to our doctors for more scans and blood work. So the next day she called the ortho for us and we called the pediatrician. We went to three appointments that day. Pediatrician, blood work (ordered by pediatrician), and the ortho. The ortho took another X-ray, charged me for my visit (yes I'm bitter) and told me he wasn't qualified to help us because he saw nothing wrong and 'sees kids who have sports injuries'. So he referred us to a better ortho - the best pediatric ortho in Dallas. The new ortho got us in the next day (Friday). He ordered an MRI which we had Saturday and he reviewed it over the weekend. He called Sunday night and told us MJ had infection in his pelvic bone and that he would need to operate within the week. He operated the first time on 12/20 (Wednesday). They took cultures but nothing (no bacteria) ever grew in the lab. MJ slowly improved following surgery, but 10 days later (12/30) he had a night of terrible pain that woke him from sleep and couldn't be managed. We were out of town so went to an ER under our Ortho's instruction and had blood work and an ultrasound. Blood work hadn't improved so they changed our oral antibiotic but ultrasound looked normal. MJ started using his crutches 100% of the time and after not using the leg for a week or so it felt a little better but if he moved to much it resulted in hours of crying. Still nothing growing in the lab. After returning home we had a follow up appointment and did blood work to check infection markers - they were WORSE not better. So the doctor ordered another MRI which we did the next afternoon. The doctor called about 2 hours after the MRI to tell us the infection in the pelvic bone was worse/bigger than when he operated. We had to go back into the operating room for the same procedure THAT NIGHT. It was much more aggressive/invasive and he was in a lot of pain. They took more cultures but again, nothing grew in the lab. They put in a PICC line so he could get IV antibiotics at the hospital and then eventually at home for 6 weeks. Unfortunately a couple days later he was back in terrible pain in his thigh that caused moaning and screaming for long periods of time. Another MRI showed that he had infection/an abscess in his right thigh. Enter his 3rd surgery in a month on 1/20. More fluid taken for culture, but again nothing grew in the lab. Walking was limited to 25-50 steps and every time he got out of bed it resulted in an hour or more of terrible pain. He got mildly better and we were released on Wednesday 1/24 to home health. Home was hard too. He might be fine for hours but if he had to crutch-it to the bathroom it would result in hours of writhing in pain and often fever. Tuesday 1/30 returned disappointing blood work and Wednesday 1/31 we had another MRI. The next day we had a follow up appointment at his office. When he came in MJ was on the table crying in pain. He asked us to come back into the hospital to operate in the pelvic bone again. MJs 4th surgery was 2/1. They took a ton of bone and fluid and tissue so that they could rule things out and hopefully finally identify the root cause. MJ continued to have terrible pain. We all thought it was from the surgery but it got worse not better. His pain in his thigh was/is unbearable. They went through all the most powerful pain medications and nothing worked for more than a few minutes. He can't walk and can barely stand. And now I come to (believe it or not) the worst part of MJs tale. The surgeon came to us last night (2/5) and asked if we wanted him to speak in front of MJ or in private. I already knew the news would be unbearable. He started with the fact that there was more/new infection in the right thigh and some also in the left visible from yet another MRI that morning. He would probably have to operate again. But he hadn't gotten to the worst part. The pathology lab had returned results. Yes they saw inflammation in the bone (indicating infection), but also ""Small round blue cell tumor"" cells. We don't get know for sure which 'flavor' of cancer (yes, I just said that MJ has cancer). Our amazing orthopedic surgeon thinks it is one from a short list: Lymphoma of bone, Ewing's sarcoma, or PNET. He said it's aggressive, and its life threatening. And we can assume that if he had these cells in his pelvic bone that they are in all of his bones. We are moving to a Dallas hospital with an oncology department in the morning, and plan to get a second opinion regarding the plan to heal him either in Houston or New York. It's our understanding that for this rare form of cancer those are the most qualified hospitals. And tonight we tell our 12 year old that he has cancer.",d0acc31870556016b98a80588ac22941,86,0.44484,330.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

For the past several years, we have participated in charity events to raise money to help with humanity’s fight against cancer. In recent years, we raised money for the American Cancer Society via previous livestreams and by participating in the Relay For Life, a 24-hour relay walk. This year, we are once again streaming to benefit the Cancer Research Institute. The CRI is a non-profit organization that funds cancer research, particularly in the field of immunotherapy. Founded in 1953, we picked the CRI because of a couple reasons, including their more global scale (since we all can benefit from medical research), but more importantly because over 85% of their funds go to programs. If you’re interested in getting some statistics on them, I would suggest checking their page on CharityNavigator. Previous funds raised: 2016: $940 2015: $785 2014: $700 We’re very excited to try to break $1000 this year and we’re hopeful that the upward trend of donations will continue. We’re both grateful and inspired by the amount of support that has come to these events. This year, we’re very excited to : 1. We’re playing Bloodborne. No easy feat in itself. 2.

When he isn't ill, he never hesitates to answer a page.  He is also very passionate about his lighting designs.  He loves his jobs and the people he works with.   We need to raise funds for Erik to beat this cancer and to get his liver transplant.   He is usually the first to arrive at the cancer center and the last one to leave on chemo days.  He will be starting radiation 2 times a day which is a lot for three and a half weeks. The liver transplant is unbelievably expensive and a lifelong  endeavor.  There are medicines he will be required to take that are very expensive every day of life so his body won't reject his new liver.  We strive to live one day at a time.  Unforunately, we do know we have to raise money for these medical bills, which means planning ahead. I've been learning to accept help from others. I am so grateful.  We are especially thankful for everyone's prayers!!Any donation will be tremendously appreciated.  All we want is for Erik to beat this cancer and have a successful liver transplant.  His goal he shared with his transplant social worker was simple, ""I want to see my girls grow up.""Our beautiful little girls need him to reach his goal.  Erik brings something to this family that no one else can.

Doctors recommended chemotherapy as the only solution at first. We refused chemotherapy because of the  damage that it causes and the lack of guarantee that the patient will survive even with the treatment. Since we refused the treatment the hospitals and doctors offer no other solution but to let him die. However, we have found out the there is an alternative treatment to cancer other than chemotherapy. The treatment that we speak of is the infusion of Vitamin C thru an IV. The problem is that the hospitals refuse to use anything other than chemotherapy because it is the only standard procedure. Even though there is plenty of research showing that this alternative works. Since conventional hospitals will not give my dad the Vitamin C via IV. Herein lies our problem and where you can help us. His insurance will not pay for this treatment and therefore we must pay out of pocket all the expenses. We have found a clinic that provides the treatment but they charge $200 per visit. They recommended 3 visits a week for 4 to 6 months which add up to approximately $9,600 to $14,400.

El tratamiento del que hablamos es la infusión de Vitamina C a través de un IV. El problema es que los hospitales se niegan a usar otra cosa que no sea la quimioterapia porque es el único procedimiento estándar. Aunque hay muchas investigaciones que demuestran que esta alternativa funciona.Dado que los hospitales convencionales no le darán a mi padre la Vitamina C vía IV.

Our beautiful Mum Barbara, who everyone knows and loves as Barb, has been shocked by the diagnosis that she has Oesophageal Cancer - Stage 4 which is an aggressive and incurable form of Cancer. Barb is the most caring, loving person who loves to chat and always has a smile on her face and would do anything for anyone. We are all deeply saddened by this news and are asking for your urgent help. Whether it be donations, kind words or prayers, it will all be deeply appreciated from Barb and the Pavez family. We (Bianca, Suzy and Daniel) are running this campaign for our amazing mum to take some of the financial pressures off our family as she goes through this fight with cancer. You might be wondering what Oesophagael Cancer is - the oesophagus is a long, muscular tube that connects your mouth to your stomach. Barb has a large tumour at the bottom of the Oesophagus which stopped her from having the ability to eat and drink and caused her extreme discomfort, pain and vomiting on a daily basis. Oesophagael Cancer originates from GERD disease, which is a form of acid reflux that can form into Cancer. It has no screening detection method, upsettingly only showing symptoms of the Cancer in it’s advanced stages and usually too late for any cure. Barb’s Cancer has spread to her lymph nodes and metastasized to her stomach. More info on Oesophagael Cancer can be found here:  https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/oesophageal-cancer/ After many extensive tests before and during her hospital admission for a period of 2 weeks they were finally able to locate the Primary Tumour in the Oesophagus through an endoscopy. In December, Barb then had an operation to have an Oesophagael stent inserted to allow her to eat and drink. Unfortunately the stent had little to no effect. After being told the Cancer is incurable, she was offered 3 rounds of chemotherapy to try and prolong the time she has left but she has only been able to tolerate one. The chemo has left her extremely unwell and has further affected her immune system leaving her prone to infection and ongoing side effects of constant nausea, pain and vomiting and a further 2 hospital admissions. Barb has also had an extreme weight loss with the aggressiveness of this Cancer. She has dramatically lost 33kg over 3 months and still is losing weight daily. We have now been advised by oncologists that there is no further treatment available other than anti-nauseating drugs and steroids. The doctors have told us that the prognosis of time left is unknown due to the Terminal Cancer being so unpredictable it could be months or fingers crossed year/s. Barb is using alternate medications to combat the Cancer to alleviate pain and discomfort of nausea and the other effects. She is now at home with family under the care of the Palliative Care team.This GoFundMe page has been set up by her children/ family to help cover extra costs associated around alternative medicines, transport and other unforeseen costs associated with mum’s Cancer. Even though mum loves her work and is missing it immensely, her focus right now is solely on her quality of life and spending it with family and friends. Any donation big or small would really help ease some of the financial pressure in what is already a difficult time. If you are personally unable to donate, sharing this page on Facebook will also help us greatly.Your kind messages will also go a long way to help mum focus only on her recovery, so we welcome your thoughts and prayers in the comments below. We will also use this page to update you on the latest with Barb.If you would like to share your stories about any successful Cancer cures please do so below.Thank you for your support xoBianca, Suzy and Daniel

An avid 42 year old crossfitter, he brags about beating the “young bucks” in the Workout of the Day (WOD). He listens to nutrition podcasts, always eager to try to latest diet or supplement. He ran a half marathon in August. But after the October wildfires, he noticed he had difficulty breathing that wasn’t clearing up. By November, the young bucks were passing him up and when the medical insurance for his new job started on December 1, he went to the Kaiser expecting antibiotics for pneumonia. The chest x-ray raised concerns, and he was sent for a CT scan on Saturday, the 2nd.On Monday, the 4th,  I joined him at a follow up appointment with a respiratory doctor. As he showed us the CT scan, he said we should prepare ourselves. This looks like cancer. They are words that no one can prepare you for, that literally knock the wind out of you. He showed us the dark void in his right lung, which was halfway full of fluid. This explained the difficulty breathing. The Dr. offered to drain the fluid, a liter of it was removed there in the office. He sent it for testing. On Wednesday the 6th, we got the dreaded call. The fluid tested positive for cancer. With our 3 children, we hugged; we cried; our world was crashing in around us. Daddy has cancer. That night was the start of many difficult phone calls, through tears, in shock, helping your friends and loved ones cope with the news you have barely even begun to process yourself. Cancer. F Cancer.On Monday the 11th, we met with the oncologist. She explained that the blood work on his lung fluid appeared “disorganized”, meaning she could not yet determine the type of cancer, in order to set a treatment plan. She said the CT scan showed nodules in both lungs, a mass behind his chest plate and something in his abdomen, by which she deemed this stage 4. “It’s considered incurable”, she said. “Our goal is extending life.” Perhaps that is your goal doctor, but Matt is a fighter and our God is able! She scheduled a Biopsy, for Wednesday the 13th, of the mass for further testing. The surgery went fine, but by Thursday, the right lung was filling up again. His oncologist ordered surgery for a permanent drain to be placed in his lung, to remove the pleural fluid that she expected to continue to accumulate. This would minimize the risk of infection from constant piercing of his lung to drain. But, despite constant phone calls, he could not be scheduled for Friday. We were told to go to the ER to have it drained. This time they took a liter and a half. His blood count dropped. We had to stay for another blood count check in 2 hours, in case of internal bleeding. Off to Safeway for organic produce and oatmeal pouches. Blood count is up, we’re outta here! Praise God!Since the fluid had been removed, the drain surgery had to be put off until Thursday. On Wednesday the 20th Matt had a PET scan which illuminates the areas of the body where the cancer is found. We would get the results from Oncology the next day, prior to drain surgery. Thursday morning, we learned the biopsy revealed the same “disorganized cell” result. It was not a tumor behind his chest plate, but a thickening of the lining of his lung. Amen! She would send the tissue for further testing, but was able to determine that Matt has a form of Mesothelioma, a cancer linked to asbestos exposure. So that’s how a non-smoker gets lung cancer. PET scan results show the cancer is contained within his lungs. Amen, AMEN!Off to surgery to place the drain. About thirty minutes later, I’m called into recovery. That was fast?! Matt smiles, as he removes his gown. Where’s the drain? “Not enough fluid in there!”, he said. “Rescheduled to next Wednesday.” Praise God! Prayers, the Gerson method, CBD oil, alkaline water, rest and more prayer. He’s feeling better. His body is healing. God is Good!Today is 12/27 and Matt just rescheduled today’s drain surgery to Friday. He is breathing well and hopes to cancel Friday’s surgery. Tomorrow, we have a phone appointment with the oncologist, hopefully for a clear result on his diagnosis and treatment plan. Then a 2nd opinion on Friday. This is the raw, honest window into our December, 2017. We have started our journey as a family to heal Matt’s cancer. Jesus said “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” Matt and I have had the privilege to personally hold events raising thousands for those in need and friends battling cancer. Now it is time to focus our efforts on Matt’s care. Now we humbly ask for your support. To those who have asked “how can I help?”, we ask this: pray, donate, share.Pray for God to remove the cancer from Matt’s body. Pray that the fluid remain at bay. Pray for full healing, for God’s glory. Donate what you can. The reality is that fighting cancer is costly, and we are battling on all possible fronts, but we need your help. We have spent over $1500 in medical expenses this month so far. In order to give Matt the best results from the Gerson therapy, we will need to purchase a Norwalk juicer, which is $2400. Monthly organic produce is estimated at $1000 and supplements will be several hundred more per month. New employees don’t qualify for short term disability, so there may be living expenses as well, depending on how Matt tolerates his treatment. Your generosity will bless us beyond measure and give Matt the fighting chance he needs to beat cancer. Share this post, with a few words about how Matt has touched your life.

Van is in the music industry and freelances as a graphic designer, however pay is sporadic and now with helping Dore with her recovery, touring and performance opportunities will be extremely limited.  Going through this treatment will be quite expensive.  First there is a high deductible on the medical plan and the increased expenses for travel, but also the cost of her insurance premiums after May 1.  These items, coming together with their normal monthly expenses, spell out great financial difficulties for them.Here are some things you should know about Dore.  Dore lives in the Hudson Valley, NY with her husband and best friend Van and their handsome seven year old son Killian. Van and Dore have been together for 26 years. She grew up in the Hudson Valley (maiden name is Rhoades) and attended both Newburgh and New Paltz Schools.  She and her husband moved to Seattle Washington in 1993 and moved back to NY to raise their son around family 4 years ago.  Dore has spent the last 15 years helping others either as an HR professional or as an insurance broker.  She is accustomed to helping people navigate through difficult times such as these, however no one is ever truly prepared to handle it themselves.Please help us support Dore and her family.  She is a caring person loved by all of those that know her.  This entire event unfolded over a single week and there was no time to prepare for the trying times that are ahead of them. The amount we chose above is just a number, because we don't really know how much will be enough, so anything you can do is wonderful and amazing, and appreciated. Please spread the word and help us help her in this difficult time. Thank you for your donation, prayers, and words of encouragement.This fund was created by William Rhoades Jr., Dore's brother and family.

We are an adaptable family who have endured obstacles before. The father is a 14 year Technical Sergeant in the United States Air Force, with intentions of finishing his career with the military. Stephanie is 16 years old, enjoys spending time with friends, playing music, making arts and crafts, crocheting, and cooking. Tristan is 10, enjoys sports, playing Fortnite, playing with the family dog, and showing no fear when riding roller coasters at amusement parks.   In October of 2016, Stephanie was diagnosed with Stage II Hodgkin's lymphoma. She required 4 rounds of chemotherapy and quickly entered remission. Most of the appointments were outpatient, and was seen as a dramatic, but brief, obstacle to defeat.   Only 2 weeks before Christmas of 2017, Stephanie was in for a routine checkup and the doctors discovered that she developed Acute Myloid Leukemia (AML). This is a secondary cancer, which was caused by her chemotherapy while being treated for her Hodgkins. She was given a 50%-60% chance of survival.   Leukemia can multiply very rapidly, and Stephanie had to enter treatment within 48 hours in order to ward off the leukemia. Each round of chemo requires 3 weeks of inpatient hospitalization, with up to 7 days off afterwards. Thankfully, after only the first round of chemo, she was able to enter remission. This increases her chances of survival significantly. She has recieved 2 more rounds of chemo to maintain her remission status. AML will return if she does not get a bone marrow transplant. Transplant adds another 6-8 weeks in the hospital. This is where things get tricky. Prior to the transplant, her body will undergo intense chemotherapy like she has never seen before. This type of chemo has a high chance of permanately damaging her eggs. This is a tough decision to put onto a 16 year old girl, but she has chosen to freeze her eggs in hopes of being able to have kids in the future. Health insurance does not cover any of the IVF costs and is completely out of pocket.    There are several other expenses.  Transportation costs have reached almost $150 weekly while Stephanie is in the hospital, with the father trying to visit Stephanie during the day, and maintaining a home for his son at night. Toll road fees and parking fees are over half of the transportation costs. Food expenses are quite high as eating out has often been the only option.    Our family has overcome many battles, but this is the biggest one yet. While we have recieved significant help from different charities, family and friends, there are still expenses that need to be paid.  All money will go towards IVF, transportation, food, bills, Stephanie's upcoming birthday in May, and any other unforeseen cost.   Any funds unused will be kept aside to help pay for Stephanie's egg retrieval when she chooses to have children in the future.   Thank you, and I will continue updating.",d11cb8b2f6c0a3ecbc365c28fc7afbaa,32,1.0441666666666667,330.0,2,1,1,1,0,1,0,0.001996007984031936,0.0,0.8386770165372933,3.2528324553465233,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

My sister, Sandy, knew something was seriously wrong, but was dismissed and even blamed by doctors. It wasn’t until March that Emilia was, finally, formally diagnosed with Pediatric Acute Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS), an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation of the brain and psychiatric symptoms. Already feeling exhausted and desperate for relief, on the 4th of July they received the most horrific news yet; their child has cancer. Emilia was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, which is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow.  She is now undergoing chemo and steroid treatment and her PANS symptoms are intensifying the struggle. We are heartbroken and angry, but will stop at nothing to fight for our little mama. We trust that Emilia will return to her silly little self, but the journey toward remission has only just begun. Now on top of everything else that has been going on for the past several months, we found out at the end of September,  that poor little Emilia has severe mold toxicity. She will have to undergo a long term detox to hopefully remove the carcinogenic mold that has been triggering her PANS. That being said, the expenses just quadrupled as the family had to immediately be removed from their home and get rid of a majority of household contents due to the mycotoxins that get stored in porous materials. Although our family is strong, Sandy and Mark, a military family, could use your help. Their lives have been turned upside down. They have faced this terrifying reality with courage and have vowed to do whatever it takes to get Emilia through this. While Sandy has admirably persevered through the anguish of the illness, she has been unable to work for months. As funds were already tight for this family due to the extreme cost of homeopathic medicine and dietary restrictions for Emilia, the medical bills are reaching unthinkable amounts. Your donations will allow Sandy and Mark to focus their energy on providing the high level of care that Emilia needs. Your donations will cover costs for co-insurance payments for the weekly procedures Emilia needs over the next two years, the out-of-network physicians for her PANS and Mold Specialist (that charges $400/hour), prescription medication co-pays, homeopathic medications/supplements, specialized testing not covered by insurance,  and neuro-cognitive support to mitigate some of the effects the chemotherapy has had on her brain. Donations will also help support rebuilding their lives by funding their temporary housing, mold remediation along with allowing them to purchase the necessary items that they have lost. I genuinely thank you from the bottom of my heart for your generosity! Together, we will win this battle! Please keep our family in your thoughts and prayers.If you cannot make a donation, please share this post, so we can generate as much support as possible. Emilia's full story and updates can be found at: https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/emiliaerwin",03523280bb2be291c21937de74ed049a,23,0.46915,150.0,3,1,0,2,1,2,1,0.003838771593090211,0.0019193857965451055,0.3080824088748019,4.667886466148994,1.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

Two days before Thanksgiving, Paul drove himself to the ER, was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, and underwent a battery of tests. A cancerous mass was discovered. In the weeks leading up to his hospitalization, Paul endured sleepless nights, a constant urge to pee, severe weight loss, and feelings of hopelessness. Paul knew something was wrong, but was putting off getting medical help. Why? Because he is self-employed, his health insurance had lapsed, and he was waiting for his new medical insurance, California Care, to kick-in on January 1,  2019. Paul didn't make it to January 1.  Instead, he spent 5 days, including Thanksgiving Day, in the hospital after trying to tough-it-out on his own.  Knowing he had no health insurance, and because Paul is a fighter, he tried to manage the pain, infection, and invasive mass on his own.  Today he is living with a stent to relieve pressure on his kidneys, a nephrostomy tube to collect urine, a fistula connecting his colon and bladder, and a cancerous mass pressing on his bladder.  Surgery to remove the mass, repair damage to the colon, and hopefully reconstruct the bladder is planned for early January.  So far, hospital and doctors’ fees have totaled more than $20K. We don't know the full extent of procedures that lay ahead, nor do we know the extent to which Paul's new health insurance will cover these expenses, including chemotherapy and follow-up treatments.   Paul is a Veteran, serving in the US Marines from 1984-1988 and working on F-4 and F-18 Aircraft.  He grew up in Southborough, MA and is 1 of 8 children to John T. Mahoney, Jr. and Jacqueline (Trudeau) Mahoney. Since riding cross-country on his bicycle in his early-20's, Paul has spent most of his adult life in the San Diego area. Paul lives alone with his young teenage children and, although their mother lives nearby and is very involved, he's been trying to maintain a normal home routine for Zoe (14) & Liam (13) while managing his own computer technology company, and dealing with his failing health. It's been a struggle.   Paul gives and gives and gives to others. Now it's our turn to give to Paul. Mounting medical bills, a cancer diagnosis, and an uncertain future...Paul needs our help RIGHT NOW.  Please give - a little or a lot - every donation makes a difference. Thank you, Jim, Marie (Cornelia), Matthew, Annie (Cohen), Bill, Aileen (Jensen), & Jackie MahoneyIn Paul's own words: ""More than you are aware, I think of you all often in my prayers and my meditative mind’s journey across space and time.

And family means no one gets left behind.” - Lilo & StitchCALLING ALL OF THEO'S FIGHTING OHANA!!!!!!!!!!On Wednesday, April 18th, 2018 Theodore “Theo” Nathaniel Hucks was born with a rare pediatric cancer. If this rare diagnosis has proven anything, it’s that our Theo truly is one-in-a-million. Please donate, share, send a prayer, spread the word and join us in his ongoing road to recovery!THEO'S FIGHT AGAINST RARE PEDIATRIC CANCER:Shortly after Theo was born, the amazing doctors at St. Joseph’s hospital in Tampa, Florida noticed that he was having trouble breathing and swallowing. Several tests, an ultrasound and an MRI later revealed a large tumor extending from the base of his skull to his collar bone pressing on his trachea compromising his ability to breathe. At just two days old, Super Theo and his team of Super doctors went through an emergency and grueling 8+ hour life-saving surgery (that went until 9pm!!!) to remove as much of the tumor as possible. After many tests and a consult with an expert on the West coast, Theo was diagnosed with primary cervical neuroblastoma (a very rare pediatric cancer). The next 65 days of Theo's life were a blur of two additional major surgeries, countless MRIs, x-rays and constant prodding and poking. Shortly after he turned two months old, he got the green light and got his first breath of non-hospital fresh air!!!WHAT'S NEXT:Although the doctors were able to successfully remove almost all of the tumor during surgery, now the REAL work begins. Theo suffered major damage from both the tumor and the 8+ hour surgery resulting in paresis of his left vocal cord and diaphragm, muscle weakness on the left side of his body and the inability to take any food orally. Prior to leaving the hospital, a gastric tube was surgically placed to ensure Theo received proper nutrition. Each week he attends up to 6 doctors appointments including physical therapy, feeding therapy and more. Every three months he will also undergo anesthesia for an MRI to carefully scan and make sure his cancer has not returned. HOW YOU CAN HELP:Even with Theo's brighter prognosis, there's still a long and uncertain road ahead filled with an influx of medical bills and continued therapy. Theo's Mom, Mandy, has taken on the role of his full-time caretaker due to his extensive weekly doctor's appointments and thus can longer contribute monetarily to the household. Our hope is that this GoFundMe page can help prepare Mandy and Warren, bring them peace and prayers and let them focus as much of their attention as they can on their sons Theo, Colton (5) and Nolan (3).Each and every person that joins us on this journey will forever be a part of our family.

I am scared, but determined to beat it. I have too much to do, and too many cats to save, to give up now.  To complicate things even further, I broke my right foot while on tour in February. Now I have to wait until after I’ve completed the cancer treatment before they can operate on the foot.  ￼The treatment plan calls for 6 weeks of radiation and chemo, followed by 6 weeks to let the treatment work in my body. Then I will have two  surgical procedures, (not counting my foot,) to remove the tumor and follow up. While insurance will cover most of the medical expenses, without income, my major concern is for the animals that look to me for care. ￼I will be unable to work for at least six months, and without touring, I will have no income. I'm reaching out for your help to provide a supplemental source of funds to pay for food, shelter, vet bills and other operating expenses during my recovery.  I need to raise an initial $50,000 to handle the cattery, vet bills, my living expenses, and other necessary costs.

Prognosis is grim and experimental treatments that could extend life are expensive and not often covered by insurance.   Nick's tumor started in his right eye. Undergoing brachytherapy, a direct type of radiation, he was able to save his eye along with some of his vision. Unfortunately, the melanoma has metastasized to his liver. He will be starting an experimental treatment in August that will hopefully stimulate his own immune system to fight back the cancer.

She has tried three different cutting edge treatment therapies. All of which helped for a little while, but were not effective in keeping the cancer at bay.On October 16, 2018, Laura was admitted to the ICU at Huntsman Cancer Institute for a life threatening pulmonary embolism. Her doctors found the cancer had grown significantly. At this time she is very weak and the doctors are trying to stabilize her so she can begin Chemotherapy.

On the worst day of our life, (March 28, 2016), my brother Farhad was diagnosed with blood cancer (Acute Myeloid Leukemia).  After finding out about the doctor’s devastating news, Farhad showed pure bravery and positive attitude, giving hope to his wife (Azin) and pulling up all the family members together. So far, he has undergone three different chemotherapy treatments, none of which have been successful. His doctors are now suggesting clinical trials as a promising approach.  Farhad is a phenomenal, devoted father to his two year old daughter, Tina,  and his amazing wife, Azin. He has dedicated himself to his family and his community. He has been an active blood donor since his arrival to Vancouver back in 2010. It was just a few weeks after his diagnosis that his colleagues at RBC were inspired  by his caring and generous soul and showed their support by donating blood to the Canadian Blood Service (CBS). When he last gave blood in October 2015, he never thought that in six months time he would receive the live-giving transfusion of O+ blood, nearly every week from March until now. Farhad and his family have a long and hard road ahead of them. Farhad is hoping to find a clinical trial lab somewhere in the world to undergo newly developed drugs and possible intense radiation over the next few months. Farhad has not been able to work since his diagnosis day and will not be able to work for at least a year. His loving wife, Azin is taking time off work to be with Farhad through treatment and recovery. At the same time, Azin is also caring for their daughter – adding extra pressure on the entire family. This has put their family under immense financial and mental pressure that is only adding to the severity of the situation.  We want to raise enough funds to cover their living expenses and unknown costs. Hoping to take all financial stress away, so they can focus on Farhad’s recovery and health. Every little bit helps. Thank you all so much for your love, prayers, and support. If you can't give financially, please say a prayer for Farhad, Azin, and their beautiful daughter, Tina.  Note:●    Please see UPDATE page 2 for the details of the newly set goal limit.●    The description is prepared by Farhad's sister (Farnaz), and I (Farhad's cousin) manage the campaign.

Que apesar de que los médicos le habían dicho que no podía tener mas hijos luego de mi hermano, debido a su condición y lo arriesgado que fue su primer embarazo, pudo tenerme a mi.

Mi mamá  ha sido vivo ejemplo tanto para los doctores, para nosotros como para los que la conocen,un verdadero milagro de Dios, que nos enseña a todos que Dios nunca nos abandona, que hay que creer y pedir con fé. Recuerdo de niña junto a mi hermano, que en muchas ocasiones nos dejaban tiempo en casa de mis abuelos oh tios. En esos momentos que sucedia, simplemente pensaba que era que mis padres tenían que trabajar, pero ahora que ya soy una adulta puedo entender la realidad, era que cada vez que nos separabamos por temporadas mi mamá había recaído y se encontraba luchando, por nosotros y por mi familia. Apesar de sus recaídas, siempre seguia adelante cumpliendo con todos los deberes en el hogar, estudiando con nosotros y trabajando 30 años como Maestra de Educación Especial, profesión que desempeñaba con mucho amor, amaba y aún ama y recuerda a sus “estudiantes especiales”!Me encuentro escribiendo esto desde el hospital Md Anderson en Houston, Texas, ya que desde el 2015 cuando los médicos la refirieron a este hospital debido a su historial, aquí es ahora donde se tiene que atender. Con lágrimas en mis ojos, viendo a mi mamá pasando por esto nuevamente, pido ayuda. Ya llevamos una semana, semana que ha sido de muchas emociones y situaciones difíciles.

In 2015, I created a campaign to collect funds for the cancer treatment that my mother, Sandra Torres, needed. At that time, there were two types of cancer at the same time: she had one in the parotid area (on the right side of her neck) and in the right breast. Today, I´m creating an account again. I´d have never imagined that I would use this medium again to collect funds, much less that I am doing it again for my mother. Shockinly, but true my mother has relapsed again in such a difficult illness.Only a couple of weeks ago, we had taken her to her annual follow-up check-ups, when to everyone's surprise, ductual the biopsy was positive, this time again in the right breast, with an ""invasive  ductal carcinoma breast cancer"". If it's hard for me and my family, I can only imagine how difficult will be for her. All those who know my mother know that, all her life, has been struggling with such a terrible disease. Starting since she was only 17 years old and after that, in the course of her life she has continued to struggle, this time being the 7 relapse . Here I mention them briefly:• At 17 years of age, lymphatic cancer(Hodgkin´s lymphoma)• At 34 years thyroid cancer• At 45 years breast cancer• At 53 years old, cancer of the skin• At age 56, cancer in the parotid (right side) and in the right breast.• Now in 2019 (age 59), breast cancer for a third timeMy dear mother, the person I most admire and love above all things, whom, despite her condition, knew how to guide us, taught us morals, values ​​and to get ahead in life. She´s the one to whom we owe the professionals we are today and all the achievements we have had. The one who taught us that although not so good times come, we have to keep fighting and if we fall we get up. The one that during her second pregnancy, even though the doctors had told her that she could not have any more children after my brother, because of his condition and after the risk of her first pregnancy, she decided that she´ll have me. Always clinging to her faith, that faith in God, who has not left her alone. My mom has been a living example for doctors, for us and for those who know her, a true miracle of God, who teaches us all that God never abandons us, that we must believe and ask with faith.I remember that, as a child, my brother and me were left, on many occasions, at my grandparents' or aunts´ house. At the time, I just thought it was that my parents had to go to work, but now that I am an adult I can understand the reality. That every time we were separated by seasons my mother had a relapsed and was fighting, for us and for my family. In spite of her relapse, she always went ahead fulfilling all the duties in the home, studying with us and working 30 years as a special education teacher, a profession that she performed with much love and still loves and remembers her students.I am writing this from the MD Anderson Hospital in Houston, Texas. Since 2015, when doctors referred her to this hospital because of her history, here is where she needs to be treated. With tears in my eyes, seeing my mom going through this again, I ask for help. We've been here a week, a week that has been a lot of emotions and difficult situations. My mom didn´t want me to create an account and report her relapse, but I really have no other choice. I have asked for help from foundations, many of whom have given me their help, but it has not been enough. The operation will be on February 1, 2019, which is why I ask for help within what is possible. The costs of lodging, tickets, food, transportation are and have been very expensive. That is why I ask for help to help my mother, both monetary help and prayer for her.We will be grateful for any help you can give us.

This beautiful girl is 39 years old and is the loving mother of three energetic sons aged 7yrs, 5yrs and 3yrs - whom she adores.  In 2014 she was diagnosed with an aggressive, non-genetic breast cancer.  Over a 9-month period she endured 6 rounds of chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, the removal of her lymph nodes and radiotherapy.    Finally, after getting the all-clear, her life returned to normal and the little family flourished. But in November 2016, just 18 months later came the bombshell discovery that the cancer has returned in her bones.  This is called Stage 4 cancer, there is no cure and it will eventually take her life. Melissa's biggest fear is not being there to see her sons grow up, which is every mother’s worst nightmare.  Moreover, she fears for her husband, who would be left to try and work to support the family as well as raise the three boys on his own.   Family and friends are rallying to support her in every way that we can, and inevitably a lot of that support will come down to funds.  Melissa is determined to throw everything she can at her situation, including both traditional and alternative medicine.  Our great hope is to buy her more time, because one day there may be an advanced drug, or even a cure, that can help her.Your generosity will go towards Melissa’s continued medical treatments, and perhaps a family trip to Disneyland to make more happy memories.  We are trying to condense a lifetime of experiences into a shorter time frame, and to remove some of the financial stress that is inevitably affecting this little family at a time when they need to be enjoying each other as much as they can. Any support you can offer, no matter how small, would be incredibly gratefully received. Thanking you Amanda For transparency, funds raised will be directed towards the following areas: medical treatment costs (in arrears, current & future and includes costs associated with a drug trial), family breaks, reducing financial pressure through mortgage reduction, contributing to the ongoing cost of raising three children on one salary and the minimal admin costs (we are seeking goodwill wherever possible).",c87df5b73f6ecc38f2c86ed6e1eccdbb,15,0.7652866666666667,750.0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

While getting her routine chemo she had her 3 month follow up chemo scans and it showed new disease progressing. Since then she has had radiation again and now chemo. We travel to Jacksonville 3 times a week every week with one week break at the end of the month. It's very tiring, mentally and physically exhausting. We could really use some extra prayers for our girl & our family!! This is becoming so much to handle! Thank you for praying. **JAN 2017 UPDATE: Addison is still currently receiving Chemo treatments in Jacksonville Florida. We travel every 2 weeks and stay for 5 days while she gets her chemo everyday. As of now Addisons cancer is still there. We appreciate all the donations, and support! Thank you everyone for everything & always keep us in your prayers. **ORIGINAL POST 2014: Addison got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer (Rhabdomyosarcoma) on Feb. 27th 2014. Since then Addison has went thru many chemo treatments, 7 weeks of radiation treatments..etc.. She is currently done with treatments but still has to go to Jacksonville for port flush, and scans. On July 13th Addison had a CT scan of her chest abdomen and pelvis to check the spots that were on her lungs and spine since her last radiation treatment. We got the results today and unfortunately the spots on her lungs are still there. The place on her hip is also still there but has gotten a lot smaller over the course of time and the spot that was on her spine is still there but the doctors aren't sure if it's scar tissue or not. We are hoping and praying that is just scar tissue and the only thing left is her lungs and hopefully they will get smaller and go away. If not then in a few months she will need more radiation to her lungs. The doctor also said with the spots still viseable they have to be watched VERY closely to make sure the cancer does not return. But on a good note there is no new places on her and nothing has gotten bigger, everything has gotten smaller!!! On Sunday July 19th, we will have to travel back to Jacksonville for Addison to have an MRI, and bone scan to check the rest of her body. As you all may know traveling is very expensive and we also have to pay for our own hotel expenses because the RMH is currently full and won't have anything available until September/October. I was really hoping to update everyone today and say Addison was clear, but unfortunately cancer is a mean disease! But I know with God and all the prayers we will get thru this, and Addison will be cancer free!! Thank you everyone for the prayers, and donations. It really means more to us than anyone can think.

It was'nt until 2012  that she was diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Throughout the years she has made numerous hospital visits with no improvment.  The pain and the breathing just got worse.Over the years she has been on several different medicines, but none of them worked. In June of this year the pain in her leg along with her chest pains became unbareable. She took another trip to the ER. They treated her for pneumonia. She was sent to a specialist and hospitalized.  After realizing that her condition had gotten worse, the doctors ran several test. Weeks later test results revealed that she did not have sarcoidosis. They gave her the news that she has stage 4 lung cancer, with a life expectancy of 1 year.  Yes  a 36 year old non smoker developed lung cancer. The cancer has spread to other parts of her body.  She went in to work the day after her diagnosis, but could not deal with the physical and emotional pain. She left work before her lunch hour.She is unable to work becuase of the pain. This means no income for her.  After years of trying to get disability assistance  she has had no success.  I'am raising money in hopes to ease the stress of money in the next  few months. Her bills are still coming and she still wants to enjoy life with her 2 year old son as much as she can. For those of you that know her, feel free to send her positive and encouraging messeges.

With his fiancé Megan, they were planning so much for the future and day by day enjoying life’s simple pleasures.August of 2017 Matthew had begun to notice some abnormal things happening to his body. After some tests and specialist appointments Matty’s results were not good and was sent immediately to the Royal Melbourne for further tests. It was then that the horrific news was delivered to him and Megan. He was diagnosed with stage 4 testicular cancer that had metastasised to some of his lymph nodes and liver. The tumours were extensive.Matthew was then transferred to The Peter McCallum Cancer Institute where a plan of attack was put in place to eliminate this terrible disease. His chemo therapy begun and so did the side effects. The nausea, hair loss and body aches came along too, but not once did Matt ever complain and took it all in his stride to beat this son of a bitch! The tumour's began to shrink and his blood tests were showing positive signs but once the chemo finished a new challenge had to be overcome, surgery. On the 12th of December Matty had 60% of his liver removed, again he conquered this and was healing well with all things moving in the right direction.Matthew was beginning to embrace a normal life again, starting a fresh new year, 2018. He and Megan took a couple of short getaways together between doctor's appointments. Things were looking up, then one particular day in January he had been feeling a little off but was worried enough that he got Megan to take him back to the RMH to just make sure everything was OK. It was then that he received more terrible news, the cancer was back and was extensively spread throughout his peritoneal (cavity that houses the liver, bladder, intestines etc), just 5 weeks after his surgery. Matthew was admitted right away until another plan of attack was devised. This time the chemo, which began late January 2018 was going to be even harder hitting, the doctors harvested his stem cells whilst preparing him for chemo, some of which was administered 24 hours straight.This treatment whilst being administered kept the cancer at bay, however, as soon as it stopped the cancer regenerated so there was only one chance left, more surgery to physically remove the cancer. Matt had this surgery on the 18th of July and the news was devastating. The cancer could not be removed. Matt will now be on a low dose chemo now for as long as possible to keep him comfortable. We are not giving up hope though, we are looking into some alternative therapies and medicines. We hope our miracle cure is around the corner, if not we hope for time. This is why we have set up this page, if we can relieve some financial burden from Matt and Megan that is one less thing they have to worry about.

Blanquito Man Is In Hospital Emergency!Blanquito Man is in hospital emergency and needs your help! This past Friday May 26th, after his 10th chemo session, he suddenly got very ill with extreme abdominal pain and losing consciousness and was brought by ambulance to ER. Complications from the cancer have made things more serious and now requires more surgery to intervene. (In addition to the 10 surgeries he’s already had). The tumor is pressing on the stomach, liver and kidney causing distress to all the organs, making it difficult to eat or function, and he’s had multiple procedures to place stents, tubes, and drains to bypass the tumor which have all created other complications. He needs your help more than ever to pull through this and have expenses covered to get the additional care he needs. Please donate anything you can and also wish him a happy birthday this weds May 31st- he’ll be spending it in the hospital and needs your love and support!RECAP: WHAT HAPPENED?Jose Andres Blanco (Blanquito Man) was diagnosed with colon cancer in Dec 2014 when he had emergency surgery for a tumor that ruptured his intestine. Since then he has had many more surgeries, as well as complications, infections, blood transfusions, extended hospital stays and many painful moments.Last year we tried to get him to Mexico for alternative treatments as we were advised that chemo would be the only treatment offered here but it would  most likely make things worse at the same time it could help. When we tried to arrange to travel to Mexico for alternative treatment last August, before that could happen he landed in the hospital emergency again in October and almost died. His parents were flown in on an emergency flight because we thought we might lose him at that time. The tumor had completely blocked his stomach and he needed several life-saving surgeries. It was the scariest thing we’ve ever dealt with and are still dealing with.The doctors in Mexico told us he needed medical help here in the U.S. first to get stable before traveling as he would still have required the same surgeries before receiving alternative treatment there. Many doctors did NOT recommend chemotherapy, but some doctors did recommend it as an option in different forms just to get the growing tumor under control before adding alternative treatments, but with the warning that chemo will not cure and most likely further complicate things, but it’s the only thing that will reduce it. At that point in October with his life on the line, there was no other choice to reduce the tumor but with chemo, even temporarily until he can get additional treatment. After 10 chemo sessions, the tumor has been reduced slightly but has also caused all sorts of other problems (as we were told it would). That’s where we’re at right now. Now after 10 chemo sessions and back in hospital emergency with many complications, chemo is hurting more than it is helping and we need to afford other options. Any help is greatly appreciated as we try to get through this and get him the additional medical help he needs.Please send all your light and love to Blanquito in this difficult time, and any contribution to his medical expenses will help him immensely right now. THANK YOU to everybody for all your prayers, blessings and positive energy.

He had even started his own bait manufacturing business with the help of a government grant he received.Fast forward to today…17 year old Dustin is most comfortable spending  most of each day in the dark, on his bed, in silence.Early this year, Dustin was diagnosed with an EXTREMELY rare type of brain cancer, a rosette-forming glioneuronal tumour, which occurs predominantly in young adults.  There are only about 45 known cases world-wide.  There is no cure, and traditional forms of treatment are not an option and prove ineffective.Dustin’s neuro-oncologist in Winnipeg reached out to cancer research facilities world-wide for help.  Two experimental drug treatments were developed, one by a pharmaceutical company in Japan, the other by the Mayo Clinic.  The first drug was offered to Dustin at no cost.  However, the cost for the second drug is approximately $3,000 every 2 weeks, a total nearing $30,000.  Although Dustin’s Mom, Lynda Moncrief, has fought tirelessly on his behalf to have the drug publically funded, to date this has not happened.  To further add to their difficulties, Lynda and Dustin travel to Winnipeg on a weekly basis sometimes staying overnight, for medical appointments, and treatment.  Consequently, Lynda has been unable to work since early this year, as she continues to provide care and support for Dustin. Dustin decided to learn as much as he could about the beast that was affecting his brain and body function.  His research discovered a neurosurgeon in Mississauga who has performed a successful surgery on a young woman with the same type of tumour.  Dustin reached out to this specialist, and the two have corresponded about Dustin’s case, including sharing of Dustin’s MRI’s and medical files.Last week, the decision was made by Dustin’s neuro-oncologist in Winnipeg to stop the drugs that Dustin has been receiving.  He has been experiencing issues with his liver, his sight and increased dizziness…whether these are symptoms of the tumour or side effects from the drugs is unknown.Dustin’s hope now lies with the surgery, in Mississauga.   The past months have pushed Lynda physically, emotionally and financially to the limit.  As hard as it is for Lynda to ask for financial help, given her humble nature and her desire to provide for her son, on her own, she has realized that she can’t do it alone.  Help is needed as they prepare to travel for this risky but hopefully life-saving surgery, and whatever else they may have to face in the coming months.  Given this, Lynda and Dusty have agreed to let us share their story.  Please join Team Dustin and help support Dustin and Lynda.  Any donation will be accepted in Lynda and Dustin’s way, with humble gratitude and much appreciation.",b81af7f150b032f4a2f558582e789eae,20,1.1534166666666668,120.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

This would have been very accurate 4 months ago when my mom was working, competing in soccer leagues, playing with her grandson and independently leading her busy lifestyle. One of my mom's goals and dreams is to teach her grandson to play soccer, and to be his coach and mentor as he grows up. I too am excited for this to happen. There is, however, a mountain to climb.My mother's struggle started in early September when she began experiencing  pain in her chest which then quickly became intolerable when she was playing soccer. At that time, she stopped playing soccer thinking that the pain would soon go away. She continued to stay busy by working full time and any chance she got, she would drive 2 hours to stay with my family for the weekends. She continued to care for, inspire, and play with her grandson during her time with us. As time progressed, my mom experienced a hoarseness in her voice that would slowly shroud her normal speaking throughout October and November. Soon, anything she said was only as loud as a whisper.  We banded together and sought treatment, only to learn that she was suffering from Stage 4 Lung Cancer. My mom's laugh, loud and wild, which could be joyously mistaken for a cackle, was gone, and she could now only be heard by actively listening from within the same room. In December my mom stayed in the hospital for 3 nights. After more testing, it was decided that we would begin treatment. My mom experienced two painful rounds of Chemotherapy, and upon subsequent tests, we learned that the procedures were not doing anything to minimize or stop the growth of her tumors in her lungs. During this time, my mom quickly became weakened by the effects of chemotherapy and the slew of pain management medications. She lost many pounds and was nutrient deficient due to her loss of appetite.In early January, she stayed another 14 nights in the hospital, where we learned many things. As a result of her cancer, my mom lost her ability to speak properly due to a larynx nerve that was paralyzed by the growth of her tumors. We learned that because of this, she has been aspirating food and liquids that she was consuming. Last week we had the procedure to add a feeding tube in order for her to feed safely. This is the most shocking piece for me, knowing how much of a foodie my mom is, she can no longer eat by mouth and taste all of the flavors she was once passionate about experiencing. We soon decided it would be best for my mom to move in with me and my family to enjoy our company and especially that of her grandson.We continue to fight this cancer with new treatments of immunotherapy and a variety of physical, occupational, emotional and spiritual therapies. I have recently returned to work full time and with the help of my mother's sister and ""Mama Chapi"", her mother, who have arrived from Peru, we have made it possible for my mom to receive 24 hour care. However, my family will return to Peru, next week, 2/8/18 and I will begin to seek care assistance while my husband and I are fulfilling our other work responsibilities. I know it takes a village to raise and bring up a family young or old. Together we can help my mom bounce back! My mom is only 58 years old and we still have so much time to enjoy together, especially now that she's living with my family and I. Your generous donation will help my cover my mom's medical bills and the personal care assistance that she now requires. I know in my heart that my mom will live her dream of teaching her grandson to play soccer. Please please help my mother make her dream a reality. We are forever grateful to you!Love, Lilia",8d1d8fc3259b2f741c25824b08ccb003,31,0.2899333333333333,360.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I’ve been battling constant pain and symptoms in the form of debilitating migraines, seizures, TIAs, aphasia, vertigo, nausea and endured six weeks of Radiotherapy that gave no relief. We’ve been working on pain and seizure management and the far too common practice with a tumor of ‘wait and see’. Unfortunately the routine annual scan on 10.01.18 showed gross abnormalities of the tumor. This resulted in a needle biopsy the following day. The pathology report was shared on 10.10.18 with markers showing the brain stem glioma as malignant. Average Survival: 15 -18 months; as gaged by my markers with conventional treatment.  I’m still trying to wrap my mind around this. It is impossible; this can’t be real. And while statistics are against me, it hasn’t changed my determination to find a way to be the exception. The side effects of SOC (conventional treatment) will decrease my quality of life and not give a longer life expectancy. I need a long term treatment, something that is going to give me hope and quality of life. I REFUSE TO GIVE UP!Due to current FDA restrictions in the US, I’ve been referred for full Immunotherapy Treatment at clinics worldwide that are having incredible results.  (Wait listed for trials in the US) Using the Dendritic cell vaccine which is cultured specifically to me by using my own blood, it boosts my own immune system to eliminate/stabilize the tumor and is completely noninvasive.  Clinics have patients with my diagnosis still alive 8+ years later and I am in direct contact with many who are doing incredibly well with multiple stable scans. The downside to this is the huge cost that it involves.  It is just a rough estimate without travel costs and current basic cost of living. After the initial intense regime of 4 weeks to get the tumor stable, the vaccine is then administered 4 more times spread out 6 - 8 weeks apart. So the travel to and from the clinic, the loss of complete income and the basic cost of living while doing this is what we are up against. All of this is so promising though and I have to believe this IS within reach!! I’m so excited by the possibility of remaining here with my daughter.  My goal is to simply stay alive for her!Zoë is just shy of her Sweet Sixteen. She is the joy and love that keeps my heart beating.  I need the chance to guide her and help her through this world. She’ll need me to wipe her tears and hold her the first time she gets her heart broken.  I want to share her happiness and joy when she truly falls in love with a man worthy of her.  Be here for her on her wedding day and see her hold her own daughter.I am not afraid, but she still needs me. Zoë is my baby girl and would be completely lost without me. It’s just the two of us - our bond is more than I ever could have hoped for.  I may not be good at anything at all, but I am so proud of the young woman Zoë has become .... and I did that. I have so much more to give and share with her. She deserves more time .... this would break her.  Asking for help is so difficult. However I can’t do this on my own.  I will continue to be completely transparent and share everything implemented along the way.  My mindset is strong. I’m fighting this and I refuse to leave Zoë motherless and alone.  Thank you for your love and support as my journey continues.  I believe I can and will beat this! With love and immense gratitude, Michel xx",380bbfad850c115181dd34482a662859,40,0.315725,210.0,0,1,0,2,1,2,1,0.0030581039755351682,0.0015290519877675841,0.9421557562076749,3.176418581286331,1.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

Anyone who knows her knows the fun spirited, kindness, hard work, and strength she exudes as a person. She is a devout follower of Jesus and mother above all else. What I have also come to learn is this isn’t an anomaly in her family; strength, hard work, determination, and kindness are traits that run deep. These qualities radiate in the unbreakable bond Tesheka and her sister Tiffany have with one another and have instilled in their daughters Wysdom and Zyon. They all share a unique connection that is unlike any other. Befriending someone on Facebook allows you a glimpse into their lives, anyone connected with Tiffany and Tesheka are able to share in the sweet little life of Zyon. She has an adorable, fun loving, joyful sweet soul. The videos of Zyon from a young age singing, dancing, and praising the Lord bring a smile to anyone who views them. To say she is a special little girl is an understatement. She is a super hero for Christ and embodies the special qualities her mother and aunt have instilled in her. As I watch these videos I can’t help but think we can all learn from Zyon’s love for life and Jesus, it is pure and sincere.   Not only do Tesheka and Tiffany raise their daughters together, but they do so in Chicago where life isn’t always easy and has a unique set of obstacles. I have always admired how Zyon and Wysdom are still able to be kids, their mothers have worked very hard to ensure their girls maintain their childlike innocence. Yet no matter how hard you fight as a mother to provide for and protect your children, get them the best education, and keep them from harm’s way, there is nothing that can prepare or protect your child from illness. Last week I received a text message from Tesheka about Zyon that rocked me to my core. I can’t begin to imagine how scared, sad, angry, every range of emotion Tiffany and Tesheka must be feeling right now. Sweet little 8 year old Zyon was taken to urgent care not feeling well and immediately sent to the ER. The next day a rigorous series of tests were run and Zyon has been diagnosed with stage 3 Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL is extremely aggressive form of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma Cancer.  Zyon will undergo chemo treatments at minimum over the next 5 months. Compounding this issue Tiffany is working as a contractor and in between insurance. Nothing about this is fair, it sucks, it is expensive, time consuming, and shouldn’t happen to anyone- especially an amazing God loving little girls like Zyon and an amazing mother like Tiffany. No amount of planning can prepare you for such a horrible situation. Yet in the midst of turmoil, Zyon is joyful and fearless in her faith, she believes God has already healed her! Once again she is teaching everyone around her how to love God and have faith like a mustard seed or a small child faced with a difficult uphill battle most of us couldn’t begin to handle. No one is immune to adversities no matter how hard we work or try, it can happen in an instant, our worlds can be completely rocked and flipped on end, but it is times like this WE must show strength and rally around our friends and family. Like Zyon, I too have an amazing mother who taught me from a young age when you are faced with a situation where you can help someone in need- you do it. We never know when we will be confronted with an issue of own. Tiffany and Tesheka now find themselves in the beginning of a serious storm, an emotional rollercoaster that seems unbearable, and a financial burden many of us have never experienced. When a child is ill money should be the last thing a parent must worry about; doctor bills, travel, meals, parking, missed work; it all adds up very quickly! Thank Jesus for a website like Gofundme where we can come together and provide a blessing to our friends in need. At the end of the day it takes a village. Now is that time. I am asking you to give, give generously, and as often as you can. No amount is too small. We need little girls like Zyon to grow up, healthy and strong to show the rest of the world how to love.

All who know Sandy are well aware of her tenacity and zest for life. Initially she was told she had six months to two years...but they didn't know her at the time. she has no plan of leaving this life gently or quietly. She is a fighter. I, more than most, know this to be true because Sandy and I have been through the best and worst life has thrown at us for over half a century! She now needs our help-she need practical help more than just supportive prayers and encouraging words.Sandy and her amazingly courageous husband, Dick, are both retired and live on a very fixed income. The medical expenses for treatments are  putting a healthy strain on their diminishing savings. When I first  mentioned a GoFundMe account, Sandy immediately pushed back saying she could never ask for financial ""charity"". I assured her that EVERYONE who knows her wants to know, ""how can I help-what can I do? This is how you can help and what you can do! Help with medical expenses!  Sandy has chemo every three out of four weeks. There are regular CT scans, PET scans and MRI's.  She is on Medicare, which does partially cover a portion of the expenses. On average the ""out of pocket"" costs Sandy in the neighborhood of $800-1100 on a monthly basis. When discussing the goal for this campaign, it was challenge for Sandy to ask at all for any amount so I came up with a goal.  ANY amount you might feel motivated to give would be greatly appreciated to hopefully meet this goal. This would take some of the stress  off meeting financial demands that cannot be avoided. I want her to focus on fighting as hard as she can for as long as she can and not worry about the financial part of all this battle!

A journey that began with what seemed to be a manageable cancerous blemish quickly evolved into a rare and aggressive battle with high-grade Stage 3 nonmelanoma skin cancer. After initial radiation treatment and excisional surgery, it was revealed that Ian’s cancer had advanced at an uncharacteristic rate and dangerously spread beyond the skin to his soft muscle, cartilage, and nervous tissue—resulting in a high-risk and life-threatening prognosis.His doctors insist he has no time to spare in continuing his treatment, but no one, including Ian, could have expected his first series of treatments to reveal only the beginning of a much more daunting path ahead. Now facing a severe diagnosis that demands the immediate continuation of intensive chemotherapy and a series of additional excisional surgeries, time is of the essence.

I'm turning 58 this year so I was a little late, but finally I had insurance to cover it. I had been having symptoms of fatigue for years, but just thought it was menopause. What spurred me to get in finally, was that I started having bowel symptoms and shortness of breath.As I was coming out from under the propofol, my doctor appeared and said they had found a 3 cm mass in the rectum, quite near the sphincter. He apologetically explained that although he couldn't be sure, he thought it was cancerous, but we wouldn't know for sure until the biopsy came back. In 5 days he called me to report that the tumor  was in fact cancerous and that I needed CT scans to stage the cancer. He referred me to a surgeon and an oncologist who would take it from there.After the CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis they determined that it was unlikely that the tumor had metastasized. However, a PET scan was performed to confirm and to locate the tumor more accurately so that the radiation treatments would pin point the tumor. On May 7th, I began chemo and radiation treatments. The purpose of these treatments is to shrink the tumor so that the surgery, if necessary, is minimally damaging to the rectum. I've learned so much about this specialized part of the colon. You see the rectum is located outside the peritoneum and has its own blood supply. This is why cancer in this region so often metastasizes to other parts of the body and why it is one of the deadliest forms of cancer. Shrinking the tumor is vital to saving an even more important part of the rectum, the sphincter. If the sphincter is damaged, I could be wearing a colostomy bag for the rest of my life....yuck. So to that end(the business end), I will receive 30 radiation treatments over 6 weeks. I also carry around a chemo pump 4 days a week with a continuous infusion of 5FU into a port in my chest which was surgically implanted prior to beginning the treatments.After the chemo and radiation treatments, there will be a 2 month recovery period during which time they will determine if a surgery is necessary. If it is, there will be an additional recovery period afterward and possible additional chemo treatments.Since beginning the treatments 2 weeks ago, I have been experiencing a variety of side effects of the treatment which have been impacting my ability to work. I have already reduced my work schedule in order to accommodate the treatments. I was informed that, the side effects will likely get worse and will continue for at least two weeks after the treatments stop. So as you can imagine, financially I am struggling already and I am concerned that my ability to work will be compromised further and for longer. My copays for the medical bills so far are into the thousands of dollars. So I am reaching out to my community for help. I have guestimated what my needs will be over the next 4-6 months of treatment. I will continue to work as much as I can and will only use what I need from whatever funds are gathered.Thanks you guys!",6854d16e1bf4964cdd437995f845767a,25,0.77675,240.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

You know, the one who raised me, the one who taught me that all wounds heal eventually. She needs our help now. After a recent fall and subsequent MRI, her world has been turned on its head as she has been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer which has also traveled to the bones. My mom has always held down a job to help my dad pay the bills and now she's unable to work, spending most days in the bed due to the medication and the pain. She starts radiation on January 21, 2019 and has already racked up quite the bill from the various hospital and doctor's visits, and this is only the beginning. 

My mom isn't one to complain, in fact, she hasn't even made this news widely known yet. Please consider donating so her and my dad can try to combat these bills in the coming months. I have no way to estimate the costs of all of this treatment (and please note, her income has dropped to zero) so I'm going to start the goal at $25,000 and see what happens. Thank you, your contribution means the world to us.-Justin",08ed1b973ee246f0c2c3164bb5977f4e,10,0.0662,6.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

On June 30th, 2016 I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuroblastoma cancer. My daddy and mommy are Karl and Laurie Strand. I have the greatest little brother, Maverick, he is 11 months old. He is my best friend. My mommy and daddy brought me home from the hospital when I was 3 months old and adopted me. They have given me the best life and the biggest family to love me. Our village. ￼￼￼Although I am too little to read or write, my Aunt Jenny and Aunt Kiki (Kerianne) helped me write this message to you.My favorite things to do are spending time with all my family and friends, playing in the water, going to the beach, boogie boarding with my daddy, singing and dancing with mommy, going to Publix on Saturday mornings with daddy, playing with cars and trucks with my Maverick and waiting for big garbage truck that stops by every few days.A week ago my mommy took me to the doctor because I wasn’t feeling well. I was throwing up, had a fever and my tummy hurt so they thought it was just the flu. They ran some tests but when they felt my tummy it seemed that my spleen was enlarged. So they ran a few more tests including one for mono but it all came back negative. After all the tests were negative, they thought it would be best that they take me to the hospital.We went to the emergency room at St. Mary's Children's Hospital on Tuesday, June 28th, 2016. They immediately did an ultrasound and told my mommy and daddy they saw a mass on my kidney and we would be staying the night. Those words were scary to them.That night they ran a CT Scan and they transferred me to a new room. As we were walking through the halls, my parents didn’t even realize I was being admitted to a room in the Oncology Unit. They walked right passed the sign not realizing a thing.The next morning, the Oncologist came in and told my mommy and daddy that the CT Scan came back and saw that my adrenal gland, renal vein were also being affected. They ordered an MRI for later that day. The MRI was a long process. It showed my left iliac bone was also showing spots. I now needed a bone scan and my bone marrow tested.The next day, the bone scan confirmed the cancer has spread to my iliac, humerus and femur bones, the tumor is wrapped around my adrenal gland and surrounding vessels. The bone marrow tests came back positive. It was confirmed I had Stage 4 Neuroblastoma. One of the rarest childhood cancers.My mommy and daddy are utterly devastated. I’m not sure what’s going on but I know they are sad. They are scared. My village has not left my side. They are all so sad. Later that day my family had a meeting with all the doctors. They said, I have 4 months or less to live without treatment. However, with treatment I have a 60% chance of beating this. But the treatment plan is scary, intense and a long process. I need at least 14 months of treatment. 18 weeks of chemotherapy, constant blood transfusions, radiation, bone marrow stem cell transplant, antibody therapies and a surgery to remove the tumor. The cancer is everywhere so they have to localize it before removing the tumor. You know it’s just bigger then the size of a golf ball! That will break something if you throw it. Mommy doesn’t like when I throw things. The chemo treatments have to be in the hospital. I'm there for a whole week. Then I get to go home for 2 weeks. I have numerous doctor appointments during that time and pray I don’t get sick. If I do, I have to come back to the hospital. So I will probably be in the hospital longer than I'm home. The nurses there really try and make me smile. Then when I have the bone marrow stem cell transplant and radiation, I will be in Miami Children's Hospital for a couple months. Hopefully during those two weeks I'm at home between treatments, I can play, I can go to the beach to smell the ocean even just for a few minutes, (maybe sneak a quick ride on the boggie board) I can go to my Nina’s to play and even sometimes my Aunt Jenny’s to swim. But I can’t be around any sniffles or I could end up in the hospital. So we have to be super super clean.On Friday, July 1st, I started my first chemo treatment. This starts week one, day 1 of many. So far have had 3 treatments and I feel OK! I have not thrown up and have still been able to eat a little. I hope this continues. Yesterday, I had my first blood transfusion so I have a little bit more energy today. I know it will be tough on me but most of all I’m worried about my mommy and daddy. I hope they can still smile through this, I need them to smile, I hope they can be strong because I don’t know what’s going on, and need them to be okay. I write this to ask for help to keep them strong. Please pray for me that I can fight this, please love on my parents, give them a shoulder to cry on, tell them jokes to make them smile, call them so they know you are there. They might not answer, but they need to know they are loved too. There will be times I won’t be able to smile or laugh, so I need you to help me keep them happy because I need them. More than ever. The last thing, I want my mommy and daddy to know is how blessed I am they opened their hearts for me and brought me home on March 24th, 2014. I love them so much.Love, Karter----This is My mommy, daddy, me and little brother Maverick---￼￼￼_____________________________________Please, please help Karter and the Strand Family in this time of need! The road ahead for the them is unimaginable.

On July 5, 2018 Dan lost his battle. He was healthy, happy and hopeful until the end when he died one day after a seizure and brain bleed at the gym (he was a health nut!). He was surrounded by loved ones at the end. It is bittersweet for everyone who loved Dan. He was planning to marry the love of his life, Chelsea, in August. We raised enough to make his dream of going to Durango, CO a reality. He called it his soul searching trip and got back a few days ago. This GoFundMe account was set up to assist Dan in his battle against cancer and with the approval of the family will continue to raise funds and will direct them to the CAL FIRE San Diego Benevolent Fire Benevolent Fund a 501c3 non-profit developed to support to firefighters and their families in times of need. 100% of the funds will be used to help pay for the costly funeral and other expenses. We got Dan to his doctor in Durango a few days before he died. Let's all rally to get him buried in a hero's fashion like he deserves.

The doctors that she went to see kept telling her it was just IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), so they continued to give her pills to help with the IBS. Nothing seemed to be helping the pain that was in her stomach.  She was having trouble eating and the food wasn't diguesting properly.  The pain kept getting worse as the weeks and months went by.  Finally, after going to a few different doctors and after many appointments to try and get more input on the issues with moms stomach, one of the doctors suggested they do an Ultrasound and a CT Scan.  After getting the results, mom finally got answers to why she was having all these pains and issues with her stomach.Unfortuantly, these answers where not the answers mom was hoping to hear.  Mom was told she has a large mass in her pancreas.  After looking further into these tests and after a PETscan was done, the doctors realized that the cancer has spread to her liver.  The cancer is to large to operate on and the only course of action is agressive Chemo Theorpy.This has rocked our whole family. Mom has always been our leader and the backbone that runs it.  She has been the one who always took care of her family no matter what issues came along.  She has been through major knee surgerys,  had knee replacements and was a survivor of a major car accident. She was told she would never walk again and she proved all the doctors wrong! Mom is an amazing individual, she is MY ROCKSTAR!She is OUR ROCKSTAR!Now that she can't work, the medical expenses are starting to add up.

After 17 rounds of chemotherapy, surgery and seven weeks of radiation her cancer has refused to go away. Her last chance of treatment is immunotherapy, which is not currently covered by Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. She is going to have six weeks or two rounds of treatment of the drug Keytruda up in Brisbane at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, around an hour and a half away from her home in northern New South Wales,  to see if it will help shrink her current tumors. Unfortunately, as this drug is not covered by the PBS the out of pocket expense is quite expensive, as it is usually used to treat patients with melanoma tumors, not Ewing Sarcoma. I would love everyone to support this campaign to help her beautiful parents Melissa and Gary afford it. We need the support as soon as possible as without this treatment Caitlin only has a few months left to live. After she has begun treatment in a few weeks the funds will be put towards paying the bills and costs associated with the immunotherapy treatment, such as the treatment itself, time in hospital, and travel costs. When she does begin treatment the donations will be directly deposited into her account in order to cover these costs.Caitlin has only just turned 21 and has her whole life ahead of her. She deserves the chance to go back to university and finish her degree in nursing and midwifery, to travel around the world, to grow up and make memories with her friends and her family and most importantly she deserves to live until she becomes a wrinkly old lady. UPDATE: Caitlin has a chance at being accepted into a trial treatment over in the United States. This is an experimental trial in Houston, Texas of the drug TK216, which is being trialed for the first time in humans. TK216 is specific to eradicating Ewing's Sarcoma in patients bodies. She is currently waiting to hear if she gets accepted into the trial. If she is accepted, however, she and her family will need to pay an upfront fee of $130,000 ($100,000USD), so the goal has been changed from $15,000 to $130,000 in order to cover the cost if this should arise.

Mahalia desperately wants to fight this cancer and be here to raise their two wonderful children with her partner, Erin, and live the future they dreamed of together. We, her community, want to do everything we can to support Mahalia and her family throughout this journey. We appreciate any donations you are able to make to our fundraiser.Introducing MahaliaMahalia, her spouse Erin and their two children, Ellemere (2.5 years old) and baby Isaiah (5 months), moved to Vancouver less than a year ago.Up until her recent cancer diagnosis, Mahalia was happily navigating life with a toddler, a new baby, a dog, exploring her new city with Erin, and excitedly anticipating setting up her business after a brief maternity leave.Mahalia's laugh, her hugs, her devotion to her children, and caring nature are just some of the things we love about her. She has devoted her life to helping others: Mahalia is passionate about complementary healthcare, and served her community for 11 years in Ontario prior to moving out west.Now we're asking our communities to help her.The RealityMahalia is now living with the emotional stress of this frightening diagnosis, ongoing chemotherapy and its side effects, constant travel to and from medical appointments, the physical stress of two surgeries (so far), and living with an ileostomy bag. Her doctors say that she will need chemotherapy indefinitely because of the advanced stage of her cancer. Reality is that her world has been flipped upside down.Mahalia’s journey through cancer will be very financially challenging. She and Erin are bracing themselves for a huge drop in income. Before she was diagnosed with cancer, Mahalia was juggling part-time work and childcare, and Erin was working full-time. Now, as Mahalia has numerous appointments every week and her reactions to the chemotherapy and other treatments are unpredictable, Erin can no longer work full-time as she needs to be available to support Mahalia and care for their children. Although Erin is continuing to work as much as possible, the stark reality is that their expenses have exponentially gone up while their household income has drastically gone down.Instead of building their lives in their new city, they are in a fight they never expected. Mahalia and Erin are both self-employed without the safety net of medical leave, and they have two small children to care for.Making a DifferenceMahalia needs ongoing help with:- childcare costs - living expenses - medications and supplies not covered by BC Health - complementary care - transportation to and from chemotherapy and other medical appointments As Mahalia is just at the beginning of this journey, there may be additional costs in the future that we cannot account for here. Below is what we anticipate is needed to get them through the first 12 months. ChildcareOne of the biggest expenses Mahalia is facing is for the care of baby Isaiah and little Ellemere. Mahalia is a wonderful mother and, right from the beginning, along with Erin, has been a dedicated, present and loving parent. Now with the side effects of chemotherapy, her ileostomy bag, and the permanent I.V. port in her chest, it is very difficult for her to do the physical tasks of parenting. Ellemere is in full-time daycare, which is needed now that Mahalia’s capacity for childcare is so greatly reduced. It is also a wonderful part of Ellemere’s day, where she has friends and fun distractions from the new reality at home. Part-time help at home is also desperately needed for things like taking Ellemere to daycare, picking her up, caring for Isaiah, preparing meals and feeding the kids, taking them out to play, and all the many things of parenting that are now much harder or impossible for Mahalia to do. While Erin is a fully involved and loving parent, she is trying to keep her work afloat and is challenged now to balance home and work so both can be sustainable. Your donation will go a long way toward supporting them with childcare.Living ExpensesYour loving contributions will help them cover their regular and monthly expenses. These things include rent, utilities and household bills, groceries, diapers and other items for the children. Medications and Medical SuppliesMahalia and Erin now have a budget category they never wanted. It is adding up quickly and your donations will help them with Mahalia’s ongoing medical expenses that are not covered by BC Health, including expensive ileostomy supplies and anti-nausea medications. Transportation Erin and Mahalia are experiencing increased costs in transportation as Mahalia has an average of 5-6 appointments a week. As they have always been committed to using public transportation, they will continue to bus to and from appointments whenever possible. However, side effects of chemotherapy can cause Mahalia to be extremely ill, and taxis and car share vehicles will be necessary at these times.Complimentary CareMahalia and Erin are doing everything in their power for Mahalia to get through this and watch their kids grow up together. Mahalia is determined to become a textbook medical miracle. For this reason, in collaboration with her oncology team, she is seeking complementary naturopathic care alongside her chemotherapy treatment - all of which is to be paid for out of pocket.





It Takes a VillageMahalia and Erin must shift their focus entirely towards Mahalia's journey through aggressive cancer treatment back to health - back to a life and future they fiercely want to share together with their children.Mahalia is determined to fight this, but it will take all of her and Erin’s strength.It is hard to ask for help but, at times, this is the only way forward.  Any level of contribution will be an enormous support to prop them up through a very challenging time.We need all your love, all your support, and all your visions of health for Mahalia.

https://www.gofundme.com/eliminatingbigchriscancer,Eliminating Chris' Cancer: Phase 2,2017-11-01,11.0,2017.0,48958.0,80000.0,409.0,119.70171149144254,779,"I want to start off by saying thank you to all those who have helped us out, your support is the only thing that has made it possible to keep going over the past two years. There is light at the end of this tunnel though, and so it is time to switch gears. The next 60 days are the critical period, and the months to follow nearly so, but if we can push past this we may finally see some sunshine for once. Chris (big Chris, not little Christopher) is continuing his war against the cancer that seeks to destroy him. What we thought was in remission back in 2012 turned out to be hiding in wait. It struck after we completed a cross-country move. Between being the medical caregiver for an almost fully bed-ridden husband, and full-time Mom to a ball of energy and guile that is my darling little non-verbal, adhd, and possibly autism-spectrum escape artist Christopher (age 4), there has yet to be the breather needed to anchor in and attack this properly from a position of strength.

Here's the good:- Prognosis is good. If we can get Chris into surgery/treatment without any further serious delays, there is a good chance of elminating the remaining cancer and returning to a somewhat normal household down the road. - Chris is currently being seen by a rockstar group of physicians and surgeons, specializing in treating his Cancer. They are some of the best in their fields.- We have all the specialized medical equipment needed to monitor and maintain Chris's health while waiting for surgery (providing the insurance decides to cover any of his medications!!- As soon as Chris can work again (3 to 6 months, depending on speed of surgery), getting ahead of everything will become rather straightforward (Chris' professional experience is in Information Security, Forensic Analysis, and has done training in those and related fields for a couple decades).- Derpwovles! A family friend has gifted us three Husky puppies to raise with our old pack leader dog, and the energy has been very uplifting on the spirits of everyone involved (when it hasn't been wrecking our sleep schedules) and they've integrated well into the home.Here's the bad:- The oncologist at this juncture wants to do targeted radiation and maybe injected alcohol, which is a multi week treatment that we don't know how Chris will tolerate.- I need to pay rent, and other monthly bills which we currently have neither funds nor income for (like insurance), as well as fix Big Green (our vehicle) because I need to give the borrowed vehicle back to her owner. And prep for winter.  And, and, and...- We've finally gotten the insurance company to recognize Chris has hit his personal out of pocket max (see below). However, There's only a month and half until things reset, and the meds that currently keep him alive and me functional enough to care for him are around $4700 each month, some of which the insurance is still refusing to pay.- Potential surgery dates (the oncologist is doing some final testing to see if that is even the most useful route) are in later November through December. While that is a huge delay with the stage of treatment we are in, it will still get covered under the insurance which is a distinct positive. and The Ugly:- The ACA and Harvard Pilgrim (first the one, then the other) have spent the last year finding any and every reason to cancel insurance whether they had any legal justification to do so or not. - This latest time the cancellation was even done silently and then backdated (one of several reasons we won the fight to reinstate his insurance) to make the claim that he never hit his OOP maximum. They still owe us tens of thousands from out of pocket expenses we sustained from that, money I suspect we will never see despite it being promised in 90 to 180 days.- It has been a hard won battle to get Chris' Insurance fully reinstated, but even after victory, they are refusing to pay for critical prescriptions that he's been taking for two years or more. - Time is in a critical phase now, so I need to make sure that he gets exactly what the doctors say he needs to make it to surgery alive and arrive as the healthiest him possible.  

So here we are.I'm looking for operating costs for the next three months to keep a roof over our head, some heat through the winter, necessary medications, and transportation.",65693a1db11d0f2d1191493e6fa2b17d,22,0.611975,450.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Since that day, we’ve been overwhelmed by the constant support, outreach, and overall kind words provided by our friends, family, and loved ones. For those of you that may not know the full story, Daniel went into the ER on October 15th with symptoms of extreme fatigue, barely being able to walk, and severe headaches. Within 24 hours of his admission, our family heard the spectrum of diagnoses that transpired from just “extreme anemia” to the final words that changed our lives forever, “leukemia”. Immediately, we were filled with shock, despair, and an overall sense of confusion. “How could our Daniel at just 28 years old, be diagnosed with cancer?” crossed several of our minds.   Fast forward to present day, and all we can say is we are blessed. ALL is not the hardest cancer to beat but it is not the easiest.  Treatment is an intense 6 months with 8 rounds of chemo every 21 days requiring hospital stays each round for at least a week. These past 2 months could easily be compared to a roller coaster. There were constant battles of low hemoglobin, white cell, and platelet levels. These caused fatigue, low oxygen, an extremely weakened immune system, and a risk of bleeding.  Each treatment affects these levels differently and it’s been a constant battle to bring up these levels. If you are a blood donor, bless you!  Daniel has already received 26 blood transfusions and numerous IV bags of platelets. Though the treatment is hard, we thank God that Daniel’s cancer was caught and diagnosed in time! We were recently told by the doctors that for patients at the same state he was in, there is a 100% mortality rate within 4-5 weeks without treatment.Daniel, his wife Rebecca, and our families are truly humbled by all the love, prayers and support from family, friends, our church families, and the wonderful oncology staff at Mercy Hospital. Daniel and Rebecca are fighting as hard as they can and need as much help as they can get.  They have had to spend 40 out of the last 66 days in the hospital.  Due to the nature of his treatment and amount of time in the hospital, Daniel requires constant care, which means both Daniel and Rebecca have had to put their jobs on hold.

And that is AFTER he had a significant brain bleed!  What a fighter.  Timothy makes grumbly sounds when he’s annoyed and clarion cries when he needs a diaper change.  He smiles at our voices and loves when we carry him, sing, and dance.In babies, neuroblastoma is usually relatively easy to defeat, requiring only 2 rounds of chemotherapy.  But after his first round of chemotherapy, DNA from a biopsy of a skin tumors showed that his cancer was not the standard form, but a high risk form of neuroblastoma.  There are two ways to treat high risk neuroblastoma.  This cancer has a 40%- 50% long term survival rate regardless of which treatment plan we choose.   Both methods involve 5 initial rounds of strong chemotherapy, followed by surgery to remove whatever masses of tumor are remaining, radiation of the tumor sites, and one more round of chemo, followed by immunotherapy.  However, the protocol followed in hospitals in the DC area requires that we harvest from Timothy stem cells from and administer 2 additional, extremely severe rounds of chemo.   Because the chemotherapy is so strong,  many patients cannot regenerate their own blood cells without transplanting the harvested stem cells, and even then, sometimes the transplant doesn't work.  Stem cell harvesting has only been performed on a baby Timothy's size once or twice in the US.  Of course, the harshness of this last chemotherapy, the lack of experience in harvesting stem cells from small babies, the likelihood of infection, and the possibility that the harsh chemo's side effects may kill Timothy give us serious reservations in selecting this approach.The second method requires us to travel with Timothy periodically in New York over 18 months to receive treatment that uses a different form of immunotherapy and 7 doses of vaccine to help the body develop the ability to attack the tumor cells.  This specialized treatment is only available at Sloan-Kettering in Manhattan. We have decided to  take the him to Sloan-Kettering after his fifth round of chemotherapy, as it will be gentler on Timothy and its success rate is comparable to the prevailing method in DC.Doctors also recommended genetic testing of the cancer cells to see if there were some sort of non-toxic, targeted collateral attack we might use against the cancer.  While insurance has helped with covering some of the costs of fighting this awful disease, it is not covering as much as we'd like.  Further, insurance will not cover genetic testing that could target Timothy’s chemo and speed recovery.  And while some Sloan-Kettering costs will be covered, much of the treatment and the costs of living with Timothy in New York for 3 months out of 18 will not.Since the day Timmy was born, we have lived from minute to minute, waiting and watching, making decisions about his care, and praying that he will live.  And we've thought more broadly about our other three children, working to give them consistent focus and love to help them as they suffer through this as well.  Foremost, we ask for your prayers for Timmy and us.  We accept God's plan for us all through this and are grateful for the focus on faith and love this trial brings.  Our church community, family, and other friends have been extremely supportive.  In fact, it is only through the suggestion and encouragement of our friends that we make this plea.  We estimate that we will incur out-of-pocket expenses of at least $65,000 over the next 12 months as we fight for Timothy’s life.  We hate asking anyone to help us with this, but do so in hope we can stay afloat for Timothy and the other children as well.  Should we have donations exceeding expenses, we will contribute the remainder to cancer charities.We thank you so much for considering supporting Timothy and his family, and wish you God's blessings.-Patrick and Mary Anne**As federal employees, we have consulted with our ethics advisors at Navy and DOC.  We ask that, if you are considering supporting Timmy financially,  no corporate donations, but rather only personal donations, are provided to ensure we keep within federal ethics guidelines.  Thank you for considering!",6251974f7cd02ee50195ba1554db6767,38,0.36215384615384616,90.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

***********************************


Hello everyone, 


 
My dear friend and colleague, Cristina Enriquez, is 31 years old, and was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer in December 2015. She underwent painful surgeries and chemotherapy, and the cancer went into remission. Unfortunately, on August 1, 2017, Cristina was given the awful news from her doctors that the cancer has returned, and has now metastasized into her lungs and throat. Her condition is terminal. This has been devastating for Cristina, her family, and friends. 


 
In the next few weeks, she will begin another round of chemotherapy to attempt to prolong her life. Doctors have already told her that she will not be able to work during this time, and the likelihood that she will be able to return to work after her treatment is slim. 


 
Cristina is one of the kindest, strongest people I have ever known. She is a devout mother, wife, and daughter. Throughout this ordeal, her commitment to her family (her husband Nick, her two children, and her father Jose), friends, public service, and breast cancer awareness and education has remained unwavering. Putting others before herself comes as second nature. 


 
It’s time that we send some of that love and support back to Cristina. Raising her 16 and 7 year old sons has always been her priority, and she has not really had time for herself. Strong and independent, she has never asked for help. But she needs our help now more than ever. Because of her first battle with cancer, she has exhausted all her paid time off, and will not have enough hours to qualify for state disability insurance. Cristina and her husband will need help paying for everyday living expenses, such as rent, food, and incidentals. Our focus is to help her stay afloat and comfortable during this time. Anything you can donate will be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for your support and generosity. 


 
We love you, Cristina!

Each cycle comprises 21 tablets – taken daily for 3 weeks with one week off each month. Initially my oncologist only tracked my progress with blood tests which provide a tumour marker and this gives an indication of the effectiveness of the drug. A normal tumour marker is 32 (or less) and at commencement of this therapy my marker was approx. 400. Three cycles in and my marker had doubled - NOT what we wanted to hear. In addition, I was suffering terrible back pain and an MRI revealed a tumour growing on T6, pushing on a nerve – and this required urgent spot radiation therapy. Together with the elevated tumour markers and back pain I was not liking my chances of continuing with this new “wonder” drug.On 19 Dec I was booked in for an MRI, bone and CT scan – and the results were proof that one can never rely on tumour marker results alone. Unbelievably, all tumours were stable, nothing new reported and even some possible evidence of new bone growth.Simply the best Christmas present we could ever have hoped for – and absolutely not even possible or imaginable without YOUR collective help – whether it was a cash contribution or simply sharing our GoFundMe post. Words will never be enough.So where to from here??My oncologist wants me to finish cycles 5 and 6 and all being well, continue with the drug indefinitely. The catch is that we only raised enough for 6 cycles. However, since we started the drug, the pharmaceutical company has begun a program for clients who are self funding the drug, and once they have paid $40k, ie 8 cycles, the drug will then become FREE. Oh happy days. So I guess what I am asking is, if you can find it in your hearts (and your pockets) to assist us to raise another $10k, we would be so grateful. And if not, that’s OK too – as you’ve more than helped our family already.Love alwaysPeta, David and CuanOriginal PostMany of you will already know our friend, Peta – a devoted Mum to Cuan (13 year old son), wife to David and furry Mum to an elderly terrier and two rescue poodles.  Peta’s devotion to her son is unquestionable.  Her love and support goes above and beyond – first it was regularly huddling in the freezing cold to watch Cuan race around the track and joining the Speedway Committee, offering her services and advice.  Now that Cuan’s passions have changed Peta has also embraced the dance community, again supporting her son, and thinks nothing of driving to a dance competition two hours away in the early hours of the morning.Did I mention she is funny, articulate, genuine and always the first to welcome someone new under her wing.  Beyond her beautiful boys and furry friends, her greatest loves are entertaining friends, old and new, and enjoying a glass of bubbles or two!  Peta was diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer in Dec 2014 after a mammogram in May of that year failed to detect her cancer. She has undergone various treatments including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Unfortunately, the cancer has continued to progress and this week she got the news that her cancer is not responding to any of the current chemotherapy treatments available to her.There is a new drug that has been showing promising results for people with metastatic breast cancer called Ribociclib. This drug is available on the PBS but only to newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer patients who have not yet tried other lines of treatment. You can read an explanation from Breast Cancer Awareness Australia here.  It is feasible that the drug will be extended to women, like Peta, who have already been fighting advanced breast cancer for years but it is unlikely to be within the next year. Peta doesn’t have the luxury of time. Peta and David could purchase the treatment privately, at a costly sum of $5,200 per month.  They could try re-mortgage their house but again this takes time and is not guaranteed, and might only give them a few months of treatment.Friends and family have constantly been asking how they can help Peta and she has never asked for money, nor would she.  But here is where we step in. This fund is to provide some financial support to Peta, Cuan and David so they can enjoy what most of us take for granted – time together as a family.If you can assist, no matter how big or small, every little bit helps.  If you cannot help financially we understand but we ask you to share this story because it does two things; helps to spread the message that ALL women with metastatic breast cancer should have access to Ribociclib and puts pressure on the Government to change the PBS regulations; and shares Peta’s story with others who may be able to financially assist.Our goal is to raise $30,000.  This will pay for nearly six months of treatment and provide sufficient time to measure the success of the treatment but more importantly, it hopefully gives Cuan and David, more time with the most important woman in their lives.

The cancer showed up on the lip looking like a normal infection. However, it came and went away multiple times with the swollen lymphnode, so we decided to do extensive testing and the result came back as lyphoma. After multiple tests to determine: whether the cancer is curable, what stage his cancer is at, and how agressive it is, at the same time of having the mass on his lip removed with multiple medications, his medical bills came up to over $3,000. Once his cancer type was determined to be curable and he might have a chance to beat it, we decided to fight with him. We were sent over the the Veterinary Cancer Group in Tustin. At this vet, Noodle was treated with chemo immediately and the treatments were over $400/ treatment every three weeks and $200/ follow up appoitment after every chemo. Because of this we did a fund raiser to help pay his medical bills. We raised over $4000 and we were hoping that would be more than enough. Noodle was doing well with the first chemo treatment. But after the second chemo, the swelling on his lymphnode have a pattern on going down after chemo, and swelling up right before the next chemo is due. At this point, it's controling his cancer, which what we don't want. So we decided to do more testing to determine if he is a good candicate for lymphnode removal sugery, which he is. This surgery has higher sucessful rate in dogs in general, and as long as we have a chance to save him, we will try anything. The estimated cost of this sugery is over$3000 on top of additional chemo treatments following the surgery.  We are hoping to raise $7,000 to cover the lymphnode removal and the follow up chemo treatments for the months to come. We appreciate everyone that has been able to support Noodle finacially and emotionally. Noodle, Bear and the Nguyen family.",ecd2d3022f663c6634dad32bd5f785ee,18,0.6388571428571429,270.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

After seeing several doctors from the Henry Ford Health System, he was left with no diagnosis except possible GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease). October 2017, he was taking the stairs up to his office and he suddenly had a sharp pain in his lung. He contacted his new Doctor at the University of Michigan and they wanted him to be seen immediately. He then was diagnosed with a blood clot, which is very unusual for a young, healthy and active man. At this time his doctor decided to biopsy the lymph nodes taken. November 2017, he was heartbreakingly diagnosed with stage IV Esophageal Cancer. December 2017, Uncle Mike began chemotherapy with the high hopes of prolonging his life and to help slow the spreading of his cancer. This treatment regimen was successful for about 8 months. August 2018, he was put through more rigorous testing. The tests indicated that his cancer was spreading and he was then given 6-12 months to live if he continued treatment. He then flew to Houston, Texas to be seen by one of the best Cancer Centers in the world for a second opinion. Here, the doctors agreed with the prognosis and estimated approximately 12 months left to live. They recommended that he continue IV chemotherapy treatment while also adding Keytruda. October 2018, Uncle Mike had been feeling sick for about 3 weeks. He decided he needed to be seen and went to the doctor. All of his lab tests were negative, indicating that his sickness is strictly from cancer. The doctors felt that continuing chemotherapy would no longer be effective for prolonging his life. Hospice is now being recommended. ************My Uncle Mike is an incredible man and has such a big heart for everyone. Not only is he my Uncle, he is also my Godfather. He is the man who married my now Husband and I. He put his heart and soul into my beautiful ceremony all while starting his first round of chemotherapy. He is a fighter and although they feel treatment will no longer benefit him, he is not excepting that answer. He is loved by so many and as a family, we are all pulling together to help in any way that we can.Uncle Mike recently had no other choice then to leave his job. He wants to spend his time with his family, focus on himself and his health. He's trying new treatment regimens with the hope of some positive outcome. His new treatments are very costly and will be an out of pocket expense. Combining expenses from past treatments, future costs and now no longer being well enough to work, we need everyone to rally together and help him fight the fight. Help us spread the love for Mike Chisholm and donate to him in his time of need. He needs to rest and allow his body to heal without the stressors of current costs and in the near future expenses.  February 2019, Uncle Mike will be welcoming his first grandbaby to the family. I can't bear the thought of him not being present for the arrival of Baby Boy Chisholm. That is NOT an option. I truly feel that with the support of each of you, we can help him. I will be posting an updated photo of Baby Boy Chisholm in the arms of his Grandpa for all of you to see. Let's help him get there.

They confirmed that Draike has MDS. Myelodysplastic syndrome. They call it ""pre-leukemia"". They said that it is very rare that someone his age gets this. They said that it is a 1 out of a million chance of getting it. (I told him he is going to start playing the lottery!)They have collected all of the tests that they need at this moment. The transplant team will begin to look for a donor through the bone marrow registry. He does not need to have chemo done at this time because his white blood cells are high but don't warrant chemo yet. We did find out that this is a treatable disease but is not curable. Their hope is that Draikes body will accept the new marrow and he will feel better. From the sounds of it, he will live with this forever. He will continue to have blood transfusions and transplants when needed. The goal is to keep his body from going into complete Leukemia. The good thing is that he is young. The bad thing is that there are many complications that can happen during and after the transplant. We will return to Seattle in approx 2-3 weeks. He will have to stay here for at least 3 months. I will go back to Billings and work for the next 3 weeks then return to Seattle with him to be by his side through it all. Oh and if they can't find a donor, then they will do a ""half transplant"" and I would be the donor since I am 1/2 his DNA. Due to Ryan being deceased, he can't have the other 1/2 from him obviously.

Seizure medication would not help and after almost a year of seeing a neurologist who refused to help me or refer me; I decided to find a brain surgeon on my own to see if I could get the tumor removed. All I wanted was my life back. When I met my surgeon, he looked at me and said “You are 22 years old, you do not deserve to live your life like this. Let’s get this thing out of your head.” So after a few weeks of staying in the hospital and undergoing numerous tests, my surgery was finally scheduled. I underwent a craniotomy on November 15, 2017 and had my right temporal lobe, hippocampus, amygdala, and half of the tumor removed. On November 28, 2017 I had to have my stitches removed and that is when my doctor told me that my “benign brain tumor” was in fact cancer. I was diagnosed with an astrocytoma- one of the most deadly and rarest kinds of tumors. The rest of the tumor lies in a place that if it were removed it would probably paralyze me. Because of the kind of tumor I have, I will never be cured and there is 0% chance of me ever being cancer free. So now I have to be closely monitored with MRIs, tests, and doctor visits every month for the rest of my life. My doctors informed me that the reason I have such a rare cancer at such a young age is because I grew up in the same city where the largest nuclear meltdown in U.S. history took place. The meltdown took place in 1959 in the hills of Simi Valley and the site was NEVER cleaned up. The Santa Susana Field Lab is less than 10 miles from where I grew up. So my whole childhood I was constantly exposed to radiation and toxic chemicals without ever knowing.I am still in constant pain and I struggle everyday because I suffer from chronic migraines. I owe thousands of dollars in medical expenses and I am still waiting to be approved for federal disability. So I am asking for help from anyone who can! I have never been the kind of person to do this, but I feel like I have no other options at this point. Anything that can be donated to help me, would be so gratefully appreciated while I continue to fight this awful disease!Thank you for your help and for reading my story❤️",e0880cc1a099ca2e2763817d50b9b8cc,19,0.192,240.0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

As a God-fearing man I truly did not expect for cancer to intrude on my life. But now it has. I have been diagnosed with Anaplastic large cell lymphoma ALK NEGATIVE which is a blood cancer and very aggressive. The uniqueness of the lymphoma that I have been diagnosed with makes it even more challenging. Conventional chemotherapy only has a 20 to 30% chance of survival rate and as a result my only choice for treatment is limited to the use of alternative methods. Alternative treatments are very critical for my survival. Unfortunately, those alternative methods do not apply to Standard Insurance. I have been placed in a position of using other resources such as my retirement and any other personal savings or monetary resources that I have.  I have spent the last 25 years serving both the school system and the State of Ohio. During that time I've sacrificed a great deal of time and energy to my work, my colleagues and the friends I have made along the way. Over the years we have earned one another’s trust and confidence. However, for the first time in my life I am having to ask for my friends and family for help. This is quite a different position to be in because personal sacrifice and helping others out was always what others could expect of me. Many good people, friends and family have expressed to me that it's time for me to accept help from others.  My survival is costly. At this time I am unable to chew so I have to juice my food. The cost for food alone at this point is insurmountable.  On an Average my expenses are as follows: 1.      Food --- $400.00 per week. 2.      I also need supplements to survive. The medicinal supplements are $29.95 or higher to refill and at this point I take 60 different ones. 3.      I have to go through acupuncture, which relieves my body from the trauma of going through the transitions I have to undergo. 4.      Regular doctor’s visits to Washington, D.C. (for observation) and a local Dr. In Johnstown,Ohio5.      In case of an emergency, I have to be prepared to go to CHIPSA (3 week stay @ $33,427.17), which is a clinic that specializes in healing cancer aggressively in life or death situations. That treatment is in-house and last 3 weeks straight. So at this time I am asking for your assistance in helping to eliminate this cancer through your generous contributions. All assistance is needed as quickly as possible. With your assistance and ultimately the power of God we can accomplish this goal of beating cancer together. Although this is a very strange time for me where each day I am battling changes in my body, experiencing a decrease in energy, and struggling to maintain mental focus through my healing process, this journey has taught me a lot about myself and how to endure and wait on God's power. My plan is to have a great testimony when this is done so that others may receive the very same blessing I will be receiving. I want you all to share in that success. Grace and peace be to all of you that help me out in this battle.",0f0612237d2ccde0c4107bb66444fe79,37,0.1858,270.0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

It breaks my heart as I sit here and type this out. The beautiful little princess in the picture above is my 3 year old granddaughter Athena Lynn. I am starting this GoFundMe account on her behalf along with my son Justin and daughter-in-law Sara.Let me tell you a little bit about Athena. Athena is a funny, highly energetic, beautiful, bubbly little girl that always makes you laugh and smile. She has a huge heart and loves her family. I always love it when she comes to my house and comes through the front door running and yelling ""PaPa"", as she sees me, she gives me a big hug. She loves playing outside running around without a care in the world (like most of us should do from time to time). She loves all the Disney Princesses. Her favorites are 1. Ariel, 2. Rapunzel, 3. Belle, 4. Cinderella. She has watched just about every single Disney movie that is out there. (Athena got to meet Belle and Rapunzel at her treatment appointment. I know in the picture she doesn't look excited, but believe me she was ecstatic.)So, the reason I am starting this account to to try to help her and our family kick cancers ass. At the beginning of June 2018 Athena had an ear infection. Justin and Sara took her to the doctors where she was given some medication for the ear infection. Then about a week later Athena started to develop Bells Palsy (a temporarily facial paralysis). She started having a bunch of bruises all over her body. So they took Athena to the doctors again. After some blood work they found out that her platelet levels had dropped significantly. The doctors at Texas Children's Hospital told Justin and Sara that Athena would have to be moved to the Houston downtown hospital. After she got the the TCH Downtown and a couple days there, her vitals were getting worse so they admitted her to the Pediatric ICU. The doctors performed MRI, PET Scans, CAT Scans and Bone Scans to try to figure out what was going on with Athena. The had to give her platelets so that way her body would be strong enough to be able to perform a bone marrow aspiration. After all these test, we found out that Athena has a rare childhood cancer called Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma. She is already in Stage 4 and has spread throughout her entire body. The primary tumor started behind her ear, which was the cause of the ear infection symptoms.  This type of cancer a very aggressive cancer that attacks the soft tissue, connecting tissue and the bones. It metastasis (spreads) fast through the body, through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood. Athena has started her first rounds of treatment. The doctors are hoping that the chemo and the radiation will kill the cancer. Athena will have to go through chemotherapy for the next several weeks. Then she will have to go through several treatments of radiation everyday Monday-Friday for several weeks. The family and Athena have a long road ahead of them fighting this cancer. Athena is a very strong little girl, with alot of fight in her. Justin has taken off work since the first day (which wouldn't we all if it was our child). Him being out of work to be with Athena during this terrific time has put him in a financial bind, which is something that he shouldn't have to be worried about. If you make the decision to help them out, your monetary contribution will be going to help with:1. Household Bills (since Justin has taken some time off work)2. Medical Bills3. Gas going to and from the hospital for treatments4. Parking at the hospital (which is like any $10-$20 a day)5. Miscellaneous things that may come up.If, you are in a position to help out our family it is GREATLY appreciated. No matter if it is $5 or $100. Everything helps. If, you can't help out monetarily then if you would please share Athena's story with people that you know.I will try to give as much updates to Athena's condition as we learn. Thank you SO MUCH for taking the time to read my little princesses story.  #TEAMATHENA",aa170004ba055a9e9b7daf0e7e2beb0f,52,0.3782,180.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Unfortunately, she is younger than the recommended age for breast cancer screenings.  Sadly, she had noticed some breast changes a few months prior and mentioned it to the ER staff during a sick visit and at a thyroid appointment.  Her concerns were dismissed, and she was told caffeine could cause lumps in breast tissue.  By the time her concerns were taken seriously, it had advanced to stage 4 cancer that has spread to other organs and tissues.  Her treatment involves oral chemotherapy and hormone therapy at this time.  They have told her it is incurable, but they hope to manage it with this treatment regime and hope to shrink the tumor.  Christi has been married to Frankie for 20 years and is the proud mother of a 19 year old son named Gabriel.  Christi and her family live on a very fixed income and have found the added gas expenses, persrciption costs, eating out during hospital and doctor  visits for treatments and care, and other basic needs a real financial challenge.  I wanted to bless them by starting a GoFundMe page to ask most of all for your continued prayers for this family.  We believe in and serve a mighty God who has the power to heal and gives hope, peace, and strength in our times of need.  We know if is  God's will, he can heal her from this cancer and restore her.  She is in good spirits despite the side effects of chemotherapy and is fighting the good fight. If you feel led to assist them financially, donations of any amount would be a blessing to them.  I would love to see them have some extra money to enjoy doing more things together as a family like maybe taking a trip, making memories doing fun things they enjoy, and not worrying about where the the money for the next bill, medicine or need will come from.  If you are unable to give or prefer not to, we understand.  Prayers are the best line of defense when in battle.  We covet your prayers and know they do not fall on deaf ears.  Thank you for lifting up this family in prayer and assisting them in their time of greatest need.",8e14664d3c567334dd2b7470616b8445,20,0.55875,480.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

We found out because he went to the ER one night believing he was having a heart attack. They immediately started running tests. His heart was fine, but he was anemic. The doctors wanted to run tests to see where the blood was going. An endoscopy revealed the tumor. The medical staff quickly began the referral process. Soon, he met the team that would treat him. His treatment plan is chemo and radiation to shrink the tumor and then surgery to remove it. He has chemo every Friday and radiation therapy every day (Monday through Friday) for 6-8 weeks. Two weeks after he finishes up his chemo and radiation here in Paducah, we will go to Louisville for another endoscopy. Two weeks after that, he will have his surgery. His surgery is called an Ivor Lewis Esophagectomy. The surgeon will cut a portion of his esophagus out, pull his stomach up and reattach it to what is left of his esophagus. They will make two incisions- one on the side of his chest, and another at the bottom of his esophagus. His recovery will greatly depend upon whether they can do the surgery with the robot or if they have to open him up. The latter will greatly increase his recovery time. So, why do we need everyone’s help? When dad was diagnosed, his life quickly changed to start combatting his cancer. Appointments were quickly made, sometimes a few in one day. Either way, because he had to miss so much work, his job let him go. It seems heartless, I know, but as they said, they have a business to run. So, Dad applied for unemployment. He was initially approved based on the reasoning for his being let go. However, because he can not work full time, they disqualified him from receiving an unemployment check. Dad also applied for disability at the suggestion of his care team. Thankfully, he was approved. However, we found out that he will not get his first check for five months. Not only that, but he won’t receive back pay. In a a perfect world, we would all have savings accounts for this sort of thing, but as we know, this world is far from perfect. My mom recently became disabled and they are now living soley on her disability income. The truth of the matter is that without some sort of supplement, they can’t make ends meet. They need help with the following:-paying bills left after my mom’s check is gone-money for essentials like toiletries and household products-gas to and from radiation every day-travel expenses to Louisville for his appointments, consultations, and surgery-food and lodging for my mom while he is in ICU and food while he is recovering.-a new A/C unit as theirs just went out. Fortunately, they were given window units to get them through the summer, but will need a new unit for heat in the winter.-money to pay someone to mow their lawn as my dad is often too worn out to mow (or someone to mow it)Dad is determined to win his fight. As he told me, he wants to see his granddaughter, Magnolia, grow up. He is a fighter. After 18 years in the Army, it runs through his veins.  I want my parents to be able to focus on my dad getting better, not lacking enough to get by.  We know that God is good regardless of the valley we are going through!Anything will help, friends. If you have any questions, I would be glad to answer them. If you have any suggestions we are open to those as well.

Debido a que me han operado 10 veces no he logrado salir del hospital y por consecuente mis días por enfermedad provistos por mi trabajo culminaron. El 12 de enero del 2019, me diagnosticaron Cáncer del colon con metástasis al pulmón (adenocarcinoma) etapa IV. Actualmente, continúo hospitalizada. El dinero recolectado se utilizará para pagar el seguro médico y poder someterme a quimioterapia. Daré lo mejor de mi para luchar contra el cáncer. Deseo poder ver a mis hijos crecer y lograr sus mayores anhelos y sueños. Aun cuando usted done 0.25¢ estaré agradecida pues todo es una bendición. Si no puede ayudar monetariamente con compartir en las redes sociales y/o mensajes me ayudarán grandemente. Gracias por todo!

The vet took a biopsy of a bump on her tummy early Monday morning which turned out to be a Mast Cell Tumor. It is the most common form of skin cancer seen in dogs, but still very much a real threat. On the recommendation of the vet, we acted quickly and decided to schedule a surgery the following Thursday to have it removed surgically. Once gone, it will be evaluated by a team of pathologists to determine if it is a High Grade or Low Grade tumor. If it turns out to be High Grade, additional action will be necessary, meaning chemotherapy and more trips to the vet. Her surgery to remove the bump is on Thursday, October 25th, so your prayers and good thoughts are much appreciated. On Monday, we were able to pay for her consultation, exam, and  pre-op blood work, just around $300. Where we need help is the cost of her surgery, which is estimated to be anywhere between $750 and $940, including Removal, Anesthesia and Histopathology. Every penny given will be going to pay this off first and foremost, as both her parents are service industry folks. Please consider giving any amount, as it will help. If you've had the opportunity to meet Valerie, you know what a special girl she is, how sweet and happy she always is. She still has such a long life ahead of her, so please help in any way you can!Thank you all so much, with all our love,Jacob and Joseph",de2fe1ff29783732c0ed2f8abfdc3925,13,1.125,90.0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

However, it is the most responsive to chemotherapy. She has had many appointments to date, and will have many more to come at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. Her husband, family, friends, and cancer team are fabulous, and she is happy and grateful to have them by her side for this journey.  The team has decided to start with chemotherapy first in order to shrink her tumors and catch any wandering cancer cells before surgery. Right now, the plan consists of using two types of chemo along with a trial medication that is an amino-therapy. The first round of chemo will start Tuesday, Oct. 24 and will she will have a session once a week for 12 weeks. After the first 12 week series, she will undergo a second round of chemo where she will have a session once every 3 weeks, for another 12 weeks. Kiley is a second grade teacher, and she loves working with kids every day. She hopes to be able to work during the first round of chemo while only taking a day off for treatment and possibly an extra day to recover. She will most likely not be able to work during the second round of chemo since her little students love to spread germs! Once she is done with the second round of chemo, she will have a four-week rest period before she undergoes surgery. Currently, she is waiting on genetic testing to determine the exact surgery needed, but she will likely need a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction.  Kiley is feeling positive and is ready to beat her cancer!All funds raised in this campaign will go to help pay for Kiley's medical bills.

Cancer diagnosis is shocking. It makes you examine your life; how you spend your energy and what you believe in. Mary has faith in humanity. She believes in fairies and the magic of the world. She believes in past lives, in being in the present moment, and in the future of each of us reaching our own potential with strength, grace and humility. Mary and I have spent our lives in community connected through nature: the last 20 years at the UC Botanical Garden as docents and with Master Peaces, our own creative landscape gardening business. Our motto is ""We bring the missing Peace to your garden puzzle."" We are currently trying to figure out the puzzle of life and need your support.The treatment recommendations from the gastroenterological oncologist are radiation in combo with a chemotherapy pill for 5 weeks; rest for a couple of months to let the side effects calm down. Then, a chemotherapy cocktail for another 5 weeks. These treatments are only palliative with a 18% chance of curing her and are incredibly toxic with side effects potentially more life threatening and debilitating than the original cancer. Time is of the essence: The effects of Mary's esophageal cancer are that she cannot swallow solid food and even liquids go down with extreme pain. Consequently, she has lost 65 pounds! Her healing path has lead her to Reno to an orthomolecular physician by the name of Dr. Michael Gerber . So far, we have been to Reno two times for a total of three treatment sessions with Dr. Gerber. Each day has has included Ozone therapy , Vitamin C IVs , Procaine therapy , Homeopathics and cancer fighting nutritional support from Dr. Isaac Eliaz called PectaSol-C. The results have been encouraging. Even after the first session she started showing increased life force energy and having less pain when swallowing. It gives us hope. That, my friends, is priceless.Unfortunately, these potentially life saving alternative treatments are not covered by insurance and every aspect of making a trip to Reno has been paid for using our credit cards along with $1,000 in donations from the Gorilla Choir. The average costs are: Train ride ($200 each way), Hotel ($70/night), and Treatments (approximately $500/each day). Mary is a special light in the world, touching countless lives in the community. She burns so brightly that even in her state of health, she still sparks a flame wherever she goes. She gives inspiration to look deeply into each other's eyes, take a deep breath when saying ""Hello"" and connect to say, ""I see you."" As we continue to let the story unfold and discover the ways that the spirit, mind and body can heal, we would love to include you on the journey. We are looking for angels in the community to contribute financially to make more treatments with Dr. Gerber possible. We would also graciously accept in-kind donations or energy exchange to help relieve the pressures of everyday living. Thank you for your support, Sincerely, Her daughter,MelanieAnd The Gorilla Choir - Mary inspires us ALL.",f91ed9fd385b67ccc259ad1fa5da1c88,28,1.5624,420.0,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

My sister, Bridget, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer (HER2 receptor, a protein-related cancer) in January of 2015, at the age of 34, when she was four months pregnant. The doctors started her on a mild chemotherapy, delivered her baby boy a month early in April, continued with a stronger chemo, performed a double mastectomy in August, gave her radiation, and would have finished all treatments in May of 2016, however, at the end of March, the doctors performed a scan to verify that she was cancer-free, and the scan came back with some suspicious spots. They ran a few more tests and in April, shortly before her reconstructive surgery was scheduled, the doctors confirmed that the cancer had returned to her breast (just under the skin that remained) and had also metastasized, entering lymph nodes in her lungs. In a matter of weeks, she went from thinking she was cancer-free, to learning that she had stage 4 breast cancer. Her doctors have been wonderfully supportive and so quick and proactive in treating the cancer, but at this point they are giving her no hope. It is terminal, and the only option they can offer her is to manage it with a mild form of chemo until she succumbs to the cancer. Once a chemo drug stops working, they will use another one, and on and on until the end.In light of this bleak diagnosis, Bridget is seeking ways to heal her body. Her oncologist told her the cancer is not genetic, and suspects it resulted from environmental factors, so she is looking to heal by eliminating any potentially dangerous chemicals that she can, eating a strict vegan diet, taking vitamins and supplements, and looking for an alternative treatment center to help. Her insurance will not cover anything outside of the standard protocol of chemotherapy. She has not made a decision yet on where she will go, but her cancer is aggressive and her time limited, so once she makes up her mind, she will probably go to the treatment center within a week or two. I will update this page with specific information as I learn it. I do know that one of the places she is currently considering is Hope 4 Cancer in Mexico, which uses some treatments that are not currently approved by the FDA, but which are used in Germany and other European countries. She is also looking into a place in Europe, and is getting so many helpful suggestions that she is having trouble narrowing her decision down to any one place. Please pray that she will find the right place for her.We are asking for prayers that God would heal her, of course. We are also praying that God will draw her close to Him during this trial. And we are asking for money to fund her stay at a treatment center, which will cost tens of thousands of dollars. Please consider donating to this cause. In addition to her baby, she also has a 2-year-old girl and a 4-year-old boy. She and her husband, Nick, are Christians and have placed their faith and trust in Christ, but this is still a daily struggle for all of us, as you can imagine. If you can’t donate money, please pray. God hears our prayers, and He is the ultimate healer.

Doctors did not remove all of the tumors during the first surgery because that would have required the complete removal of her bowel system and delayed the option of chemo.After a week of recuperating at Kaiser, she was sent home, but is unfortunately unable to eat any solid food.

Unfortunately, the cancer has metastasized to the cerebrospinal fluid which is diagnosed as Leptomeningeal metastases. As you can imagine this is devastating news for Jen and her family.

Within this short timespan, she lost her hair again, she’s having more difficulty seeing, thinking logically, has sporadic seizures, and loses mobility of her right arm and leg.

Thank you all for your uplifting words during this time❤️ They’re helping her through this process immensely! Being the empathetic and kind-hearted person she is, her main concern has been for her children, close friends, and family.

Even now with the overwhelming amount of doctors appointments, she is having to sacrifice her work to take care of everything ASAP. My mom has spent so much of her life focused on giving. She has shown unconditional love and support to her children, family, friends, and strangers even in times of personal struggle. She has made sacrifice through her own stressful situations for the well-being of others time and time again. I know we can all pull together to make this difficult journey as comfortable as possible for her. ❤️ Your contribution will help pay for the countless deductibles we will be facing for X-rays, surgical procedures, and ongoing treatment like chemotherapy and radiation.

After four, it was almost all back.Not good.So, we moved on to Brentuximab.That's a less harsh, more targeted type of chemo. That stopped the disease from progressing, but it did not have the type of impact we'd hoped for.And, at that time, my local oncologist called me in to tell me ... that was it.After three different chemos and a month of radiation, they had nothing more here, in Harrisburg, PA, they could give me.Thankfully, however, Johns Hopkins - who was working with me to do my transplant - called.I'll never forget that first call.""Brian, we've been looking at your scans, and we'd like for you to come in and discuss your options.""OK.Scary stuff.And that conversation, initially, started off with things you don't like to hear.""In cases of Hodgkins like yours...."" What followed wasn't good.But, then we got, ""But there's some good news...""And, here is what that good news was —I was being considered for a clinical that Hopkins was running, and, if I was interested, I could likely get in.The science involved here is amazing.I'm getting Nivo, an immunotherapy, that is approved.The clinical drug is a Lag 3 inhibitor.Hodgkins' cells have a Lag 3 marker that make them invisible to your immune system.The Nivo turns on the immune system and super charges it.The Lag 3 inhibitor, in theory, goes to the cells with that marker and suppresses the Lag 3 part of them. It turns them on so the super-charged immune system can see them and chew them up.After 50 days, scans showed this amazing therapy IS WORKING for me. I'm feeling better each day, but this is all a build to get back to the bone marrow transplant.We have been able to raise a nice amount of money thanks to all of you, but we are making one final push, to try to make sure when I do go down for treatment all of our bases are covered. The current schedule, as long as this treatment continues to work, is for me to begin the transplant process Dec. 28.I'll do five days of chemo, one day of radiation, have a day off, then get the new stem cells. Then, I'll have to live in Baltimore, and go to Johns Hopkins, for at least 70 consecutive days.The costs are evident.I do not have long-term disability. So, after 26 weeks, I'll no longer receive pay. I'll get full pay for six weeks, and 60 percent for 20 weeks after. That, along with what we have already raised, and the bit more we hope to raise, will be counted on to keep the lights on here in Harrisburg, pay the bills and take care of me and my housing in Baltimore.Also, my mother will be stepping aside from her job as a waitress at Waffle House in South Carolina, to come here and be my caretaker while I go through all of this. So, there'll also be bills, etc., that are not yet evident. I've been humbled by this process, and the love shown, especially through this GoFundMe, has been amazing.If you can give anything, even a dollar, it's appreciated. And, if you can't, prayers, good vibes, whatever you do, are also accepted. Thanks and love you all,Brian",1b6e4e982d8765edb2a06f20780aed37,19,0.764,330.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

At 24 years old on the 19th of December 2018 after being sick for months mine, my fiance and our families lives were changed forever when I was diagnosed me with cancer. We were due to go on holidays over Christmas and new year,  we were planning our wedding for October 2019 and attempting to start a family of our own, I'd found a career path I was excited for and had enrolled to start study, 2019 was supposed to be our year and in an instant it all changed. A neuro endocrine tumour that showed up in my neck and throat area, wrapping around my vocal cord, and pushing against my wind pipe, it is non operable and I started chemo and radiation. I had to start treatment immediately because my airways were so compromised, we started chemotherapy so quickly that there was no time to harvest eggs which was heartbreaking for us as a couple. These tumours are so rare they're referred to as unicorn tumours, there is so little recorded cases and my age bracket and the area it's shown up in make it even odder, there's very little information they can give us but we are staying positive. Visit  https://www.unicornfoundation.org.au for information or to research. 

Any funds raised will be used for things like medical expenses, hospital parking, medications, unforeseen costs associated with my treatment and IVF if I go into remission. It would be an amazing feeling to be able to focus on getting better and spending time with my family rather than stressing about financial matters. If you feel you are able  to donate I will be truly grateful. Any amount will be appreciated more than you will ever know, no matter how small.

I am afraid that opportunity isn't available anymore. For those of you that have battled cancer or any other illness, you know that it not only tries to steal your joy but it also takes away your ability to work and live the life you desperately want. Daryl and Danny are still fighting. Fighting for precious moments, days, weeks and hopefully months. Only God knows the future. They are also fighting to keep their heads above water with menial things, like bills. If you would like to join in their fight here is the answer..... We can't be there to heal him or at this point even hug him, but we can wrap him in love by donating to their fight monetarily. Daryl and Danny don't have rich families or rich friends but more importantly they have people surrounding them that are rich in love. Anything would help.

He was a staple at The old Crocodile Cafe through the 90's and 2000's and transitioned to touring with The Sonics after the Crocodile's initial closure/revamp. Unfortunately his health issues cut that part of his career short as the constant traveling caught up with him, he spent time in a hospital in Boston which ultimately sent him back home to Seattle to undergo further testing at The University of WA.Jim is a pretty private person so many of you may not know the obstacles he is currently up against.In December of 2015, after a lot of testing, poking and prodding he was diagnosed  with Liver Disease/Liver Cirrhosis and placed on a transplant waiting list with UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing).  Routine screening then detected Liver Cancer (Hepato Cellular Carcinoma, HCC) in February 2016. He begins his radiation treatment tomorrow, April 29, 2016 in preparation for a liver transplant slotted for approximately 18 months from now.  As I'm sure you are all aware, radiation treatment is not easy on the body and he now needs our help to stay afloat financially while he is fighting this.  He has some minimal income with a few club installs around town but will not be able to physically do what he loves and has been doing for 36 years...being Seattle's Sound Guy. Even if you do not know Jim personally, you have no doubt enjoyed his work over the years at a venue in Seattle. Whether that be The Crocodile, Slim's Last Chance, Chop Suey, The Central or seeing The Sonics.  Maybe he made your band sound amazing, maybe you were a patron at a club and got the goosebumps from an amazing experience seeing your favorite band.  Either way now is the time to give back.

She is such a loving and compassionate person and would always be there to help anyone in need. She is always optimistic and sees the good in every situation, which is why I feel so strongly that I need to ask you to help me assist her through this horrible time in her life while she fights Triple Negative Breast Cancer as a single mom .Dawn Burke resides on Long Island, New York. If you know her personally , you know that she has had a very tough struggle for many years. It started with a tough marriage that she was finally able to get her and her son out of. She cared for her dad on her own for many years who suffered from debilitating Parkinsons Disease and he went blind from Macular Degeneration. Soon after he passed, her mom's Alzheimers made it impossible for her to live alone. Dawn picked up herself, her son and her mom and moved into a home for them all to live in together. Horror hit again three months later when Dawn needed to call an ambulance for her mom when she was having trouble walking and it turned out the EMT flipped the stretcher over, smashing her mom onto her head and she died 8 days later. The tragedy was that the EMT's lied and said she didn't fall, but hospital security pictures proved otherwise. Dawn's Husband didn't want her working when they were married but after she moved out she managed to go back to work and was soon promoted to Executive Director, while also caring for her parents. Her Mom's aide would help with Dawn's son while she worked. So losing mom and the aide made it very difficult for Dawn to continue working. She also needed to spend every cent she made on attorney fees for her divorce , which is still going on five years later. So this diagnosis of Triple Negative Breast Cancer has put her completely over the edge. She will not be able to go back to work until she gets through chemo, recovers from a double mastectomy, and completes the trial for her divorce. Possible radiation as well. Having little child support and no money coming in is putting an extra burden on her and her recovery. I pray that we can all help her relieve the burden and financial stress that is more than anyone could handle. She has proved she is strong and can handle most situations , but this is more than anyone could handle !! Please donate and share to everyone you know !!

Shortly after, we received the devastating diagnosis that she had an aggressive, late-stage brain tumor. Now, she is fighting for her life against stage IV brain cancer.


My Mom’s Story

For more than ten years, my mom worked as a restaurant waitress to single-handedly provide for our family of six. She regularly clocked over 100 hours a week and rarely took any time off in the decade that she spent waiting tables for thousands of customers. She taught herself the little English that she knows from memorizing menu items and took immense pride in being able to bring joy to people’s lives by serving them delicious food. For as long as I can remember, my mother’s always been a fighter. When my younger brother was diagnosed with a rare blood condition with no cure called hemophilia, she quickly learned from nurses how to inject medication to allow him to live a normal life. When my father was repeatedly incarcerated for domestic violence and drug addiction, she found ways to provide us safe, healthy, and nurturing environments to grow up in. My mother has survived homelessness and food insecurity, abuse and assault, and all while raising two kids and caring for her aging parents. Above all else, she’s modeled resilience, strength, and positivity in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Now, she’s facing what she considers to be just another hurdle to overcome: cancer. What HappenedMy family saved money for months to be able to afford to attend my graduation weekend at UCLA. My mom was especially excited — it was her first real vacation in years and it was also her first time visiting California. However, throughout their stay, she began to experience increasingly aggressive migraines that left her bedridden. For years, my mom has had regular headaches and bouts of forgetfulness, but we always thought that it was from her overworking herself at the restaurant.After she was sent to the ER, we learned that these weren’t normal signs of exhaustion; they were symptoms of an aggressive, late-stage brain tumor called glioblastoma, which has a five-year survival rate of just 5%.Once my mom was admitted to the hospital, doctors found that her tumor had grown so much that brain matter that should have been in the middle of her head had been pushed all the way to one side. Neurosurgeons had to place a shunt in her brain to relieve the pressure of the swollen mass. In the last month, her condition has quickly deteriorated; she’s been put on breathing tubes, her muscles have withered away, and she's been put on an intense regime of steroids, antibiotics, and other medication.The Road AheadMy mom has always been vigorously active, from working as a physical education teacher in China to dashing between tables as a waitress in Michigan. She’ll be transitioning from a fiercely independent lifestyle to one where she’ll need assistance with simple tasks like using the restroom and brushing her teeth. The initial bill that we received after only one week of hospitalization was almost $148,000. This amount has since tripled and is still growing. Because my mom is not a California resident, we’ve faced immense challenges with enrolling her for any form of emergency health insurance or financial support, even with the help of social workers and financial counselors.We’re extremely fortunate that she was able to undergo a partial tumor removal surgery at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. This intensive procedure removed a piece of the tumor that was the size of a hand. Now, she’ll need extensive physical and speech therapy, as well as months ahead of chemotherapy and radiation. If we’re lucky, she’ll be able to qualify for clinical trials. All of these amount to significant out-of-pocket costs. As the only immediate family member besides my sixteen-year-old brother who can speak fluent English and drive, I’ll be my mother’s primary caregiver in the months (and, hopefully, years) to come. I’ve decided to put my dream of attending law school on the backburner because our priority now is to give my mom the best life possible with the best treatment possible. It’s a daunting task, but one that I also consider an honor: to be able to take care of the person who has protected and nurtured us through some of life’s roughest storms. But to be honest, I can’t do this alone. In addition to overseeing my mom’s medical needs, I’ll also be caring for my elderly grandparents, raising my brother and helping him with applying to college in the fall, paying for our living expenses, finishing up classes for my degree, and completing a fellowship.Sometimes, it almost feels like too much. There’s nothing more terrifying than watching the person you love most slowly wither away before your eyes. This last month has been the most challenging time of my life and my biggest fear is that my mom won’t be able to get the care she needs because we can’t afford to foot the medical bill, or don’t have the money to get gas for the car. I’ve spent days writing and rewriting this plea for help. Any amount of support, whether it’s a single dollar or sharing this GoFundMe, would be immensely appreciated by my family.Thank you for helping me give my mom a fighting chance.",8d90026fc39380502ce438f1ffb3186e,35,0.62965,180.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

All smiles and giggles at her Freshman orientation last week, you'd never know that she's fighting a life threatening illness!In early January 2015, Emma's family noticed a lump in her throat. After seeing her doctor and some tests and a biopsy, she was diagnosed two weeks later with thyroid cancer. Emma was referred to Phoenix Children’s Hospital where she was treated with surgery to remove her entire thyroid, as well as numerous lymph nodes that were also positive for cancer. In March 2015, Emma was back at Phoenix Children’s Hospital to begin her radioactive iodine treatment, which requires her to be isolated for 7 days, which we hoped would wipe out the remaining cancer We had hoped she was out of the woods, however in August 2015, Emma had additional testing and it was evident that there was more cancer in her neck tissue and lymph nodes and surgery was required again. On September 9, 2015, Emma was back in surgery for the second time to remove the cancer. In November 2015, she was once again preparing to undergo the radioactive iodine therapy and another round of isolation. We were hoping and praying it would finally be wiped out. In late January 2016, Robin, Emma’s mom, noticed what appeared to be swollen lymph nodes in Emma’s neck. Fortunately, she was already set up for a 3 month check since her last treatment. While the doctors were hopeful it was due to a recent cold, a course of antibiotics did not work and they proceed with an ultrasound followed by an MRI and CT scan. The results are showing more cancer and the doctors at Phoenix Children’s has reached out to a cancer specialist in Houston, Texas for further treatment. At each point we have all been praying that the cancer would be gone and Emma would be able to resume being a 13 year old without these heavy burdens. Moving treatment to Texas, while wonderful to have additional specialists caring for Emma’s condition, is taxing on the family emotionally and financially. Emma's parents, Steve and Robin Warner have exhausted their savings over this past year, paying medical expenses as well as due to loss of income while Steve, the family provider, takes the needed time away from his work to support his family. Since it is now a new year, that means starting over with their high deductibles and out of pocket insurance costs as well as added expenses of traveling to Houston for specialized treatment. They are expecting Emma will need a third surgery and likely other treatments – the future is unclear at this point. The burden they carry for their precious daughter is more than most can bear. This is a time for the community to rally together in love, prayer and financial support to lift this family up and help carry them through the more trying times that are coming for their child. Together we can make a difference – even small donations can be a huge impact.Please join us in praying for healing and for strength to endure this situation and to find the blessings that it contains and the endurance to continue ahead. Emma, Robin, Steve and Courtney Warner thank you from the bottom of their hearts! Our God is greater... Our God is stronger... Our God is healer... Awesome in power. We serve a healing God!

He is the toughest, strongest man I have ever known. A real life super hero. A warrior. A friend to all. He served 4 courageous years in the United Stated Marine Corps and completed two tours in Iraq. William has always been such a giving and selfless person with a big heart, and has always found joy in helping others before helping himself.He is currently in his 2nd battle against Stage 4 cancer. In June of 2016 he was diagnosed with Stage 4 oral cancer where almost half of his tongue was removed and rebuilt. After going through aggressive chemotherapy, radiation, and countless days recovering he was finally cleared and we celebrated the success of his treatment.Almost exactly two years later, June 2018, he made a trip to the ER for back pain and a tumor was found. The cancer was back. He completed chemotherapy once again, and in November 2018 we found out the chemo was not successful. The tumor has grown and is chemo resistant. He just recently began Immunotherapy and we are very hopeful it will work. The tumor is in his chest wall and growing. William was recently hospitalized for severe back pain. After finally getting his medications adjusted and the pain at a tolerable level, the Dr's discovered fluid in both lungs and around his heart. This evening 1 Liter of fluid was removed from the area surrounding his heart and he is currently in ICU. We are waiting for more tests and to move forward with radiation and the continued treatments of Immunotherapy.Since his initial treatment began in August William continued to try and work but was often not able to. I am starting this go fund me account in hopes to raise money to help alleviate some of the financial stress he and his family are going through. It will help with the constant travel, food, care and lodging. It will help offset the financial burden of his family of 4 surviving on one income.

Financially, a disease like this one, can devastate a family...it would be overwhelming for any of us.  Hodgkin Lymphoma (also called Hodgkin's Disease or HL) is a type of lymphoma which is generally believed to develop in the lymphatic system from cells called lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infections.  Unfortunately, Ryan is Stage II and has been told he has a 12cm tumor growing in his chest that will require aggressive rounds of chemo that will begin this week (1/27/17).As the mother of this beautiful man, it breaks my heart that I cannot do it all and that I have to rely on the kindness of strangers, family and friends to assist Ryan during this journey in hopes that we can raise enough money for treatment deductibles, as well as sustain him while he is out of work for 6 months.  It is also important to note that with this disease, my son's environment has to be as sterile as possible.  Many of us know that chemotherapy breaks down healthy cells too so any infection becomes a fight as well.Ryan is a fighter so whatever you give monetarily would be appreciated.  It's not the size of the gift but the intention that matters.  I hope you choose to help Ryan with a donation to assist him in his battle against this disease and help him kick cancer in the butt.God bless,Schaun MorganRyan's Mom",7d34012583e0a0b437385c965afda9ae,10,0.7246666666666667,720.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

She received a call from her doctor at Kaiser officially confirming she had cancer. Laurel was diagnosed with a rare form of GI cancer called Cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct cancer.  This type of cancer only accounts for 3% of all GI cancers and is typically seen in adults 50-70 years of age.  For her to receive this diagnosis at the age of 32 is nothing short of shocking!Thankfully Laurel listened to her body and went to see the doctor when she did.  Cholangiocarcinoma doesn't present a lot of symptoms until it is usually far progressed (Stage 4).  Being diagnosed early is quite a relief, all things considered.  Laurel has been fighting to get the best treatment that she deserves. She has also chosen to not just focus on the diagnosis, but also full body, mind and soul wellness. She has overhauled her diet to plant based, non-dairy, organic, low fat and continues to keep up her work out routine to be in the best health possible to take this battle head on!She has been surrounded by a very strong support system which, day in and day out, continues to be there through this fight. She has sent her scans to numerous specialist across the country to make sure that she is getting the most information and best treatment possible. The best case scenario for a cancer free outcome would be a liver transplant.  She is currently waiting on treatment plans from multiple major cancer centers across the nation to see if she would be a candidate for this procedure. A liver transplant is a complex surgical procedure during which her diseased liver will be removed by surgeons and replaced with a donated liver from a living or deceased donor.  If she is not deemed a candidate for transplant, chemotherapy and radiation treatments will be started in hopes of shrinking the tumor so that she can be reevaluated for surgery at a later date.  Although it will not be an easy process this will give her the best chance to be cancer free, mentally she is getting prepared for this! I am asking that you share her story. She is such an loving, fun, loyal person and has been there for so many people in her life that now is our chance to be there for her! If possible feel free to reach out to her, to send some love, write her a note of encouragement, donate or all of the above! Cancer is a battle no one should face alone.  Laurel has continued to work while going through all of this but I would love to raise funds to help her with the upcoming medical cost, travel and missed work that she will have to endure while going through treatment. Thank you for your time to read about Laurel’s story, and from the bottom of my heart I appreciate any support you can provide her!Love,Patty""Tough times never last, but tough people do.""—Robert H.

He had recently completed a Bachelor of Engineering in Petroleum with Honors and was looking to learn English to assist his future career prospects. It was a dream of his to travel and leave his homeland for the first time. He was following in his older brother’s, Javier, footsteps who had moved to Australia 1 year ago to also study English.. Within two months of arriving in Australia, Jesus E. Cabrales Galán was diagnosed with metastatic stomach cancer (stage 4) which has a poor prognosis. He is the only person of his age in Victoria who currently has this disease. Jesus will need to receive at least 12 cycles of chemotherapy and possibly surgery to try and control his disease.Jesus arrived in Australia without any symptoms, however within two weeks he started vomiting, he was not able to eat any food and he lost a lot of weight. He went to three different doctors who conducted several blood tests and scans and after about a month, they discovered he learned of his advanced diagnosis.Jesus had cancelled his Colombian health insurance when he left Colombia and his family does not have the economic resources to support him. He had purchased Australian student insurance as required by the relevant Australian authorities on arrival. His claim however was only partly covered due to the alleged pre-existence of the cancer at the time of diagnosis as it was advanced. The decision taken by the insurance company was to cover only 6 cycles of chemotherapy until the end of September at this stage, despite the medical findings that Jesus’s Oncologist & specialists had found. There is no guarantee that this will be extended. The unknown and the financial costs are causing great stress to Jesus and his family as he continues to receive cancer treatment.He has now received 4 cycles of chemotherapy and the recent restaging scans have shown that the stomach tumor has reduced by 50%. This is a good response and his oncologist has recommended him to continue ongoing treatment in Australia.Jesus needed to start his treatment immediately when he was diagnosed, therefore he and his brother had to initially pay for his first couple of cycles of treatment upfront. The treatment is expensive and Jesus can’t wait to finish it to stop exposing himself to greater risk of toxins. Despite living through this truly tough situation, having their family thousands of kilometers away, Jesus is armed with faith and courage to overcome this tough time in his life. An application has been made to the Australian immigration department for his mother to travel from Colombia to help support her son.He continues to attend College to learn English when he is feeling well enough between treatments.

She was diagnosed January 2012 .This little girl has been through so much in her short life. Countless rounds of chemotherapy and even radiation. Trinity has had many ups and down through out her journey but she continue to fight with a smile on her face. Trinity had reached her limit on chemotherapy and has been off chemotherapy since the end of summer 2014. Her tumor had been stable since and seem to show improvement. Since then we have been dealing with side effects from treatment and tumor but recently our world had change very drastically. Trinity had been experiencing headaches and neck pain. She was showing signs of tightness on her left side and had a droopy lip on the left side. We took her to our local emergency room were they consulted with u of m. U of M had moved her Mri up sooner then the beginning of November. They sent her home with a different pain medication which was helping but then that stop working as well. We were extremely worried. Trinity had a eye appointment with her eye doctor and everything was going good but at the end the doctor notice edema in the back of her eyes and wanted her MRI moved up asap. On October 6th 2017 was her MRI day and that is the day that our life had change drastically. We found out that trinity had a second tumor in a different location that had grown drastically. It was not even on the MRI in May 2017 but had grown drastically since then. Her first tumor was still stable and actually looked better then her May MRI this was so hard to take in. She was admitted that evening and put on steroids instantly which helped with the swelling and pain. On October 7th she had a biopsy to take a sample of the tumor and we were later released a week later. We went back for the result on October 16 and found out that the new tumor is a grade 4 Glioblastoma. It is consider inoperable because of the location it is at. It is possible that if removed she could lose motor functions. We are so scared for her and trying to be as strong as we possibly can for her, but we know how aggressive this tumor can be. We discuss her options with her onconologist and she felt her best options at this point is to start radiation therapy which will be a 6 week treatment in Ann Arbor. This was a complicated decision to make because we were informed when we met with the radiation doctor that on the initial MRI the tumor area that would have to be attacked looked like it was pushing on the brain stem or was moving into the brain stem. She said that she would have to target that area as well which trinity could have some weakness & numbness on the left side. We live almost 2 hours away so there be a lot of traveling back and forth. Mom & Trinity will be staying most of the stay in Ann Arbor at a hotel and Dad will be traveling back and forth. Any donations even if it’s a dollar will help them continue to help Trinity.

She's my ""person""--the one who's always in my corner and the one who can tell me when I'm being a jerk.  That friend who celebrates my highs and crawls in the hole with me for my lows. ￼She's 39 years old and a mother to Shyla, the most amazing 5 year old I have ever met.￼A week ago, we were talking about light fixtures and furniture for the fixer-upper home she just bought in September with the love of her life, Dustin, and laughing about how living without a kitchen wasn't really affecting her since she doesn't like to cook.Two days later, we were talking about cancer. Her cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer--which I would later learn is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer that isn't even discovered until you're already in stage 3 or 4. The news brought me to my knees. Immediately, I thought of my ""niece"" and the possibility that she could live a life without my friend as her mother. The air left my lungs. Google offered no solace--this cancer is a relentless bitch.The days since have been a whirlwind--a biopsy confirmed she has a malignant tumor in her breast and an ultrasound revealed the cancer has spread to her lymph nodes. We held our breath for the next few days while we waited for the results of an MRI of her brain, a bone scan and a CAT scan--all done to determine if this rapidly advancing cancer has spread to any of her other organs.Miraculously, the other tests have given us good news. It appears that the cancer is centralized to her breast and lymph nodes, which gives us a glimmer of hope in a somewhat grim diagnosis. Yesterday, the chemo port was implanted in her chest, and it all became real. This fight is going to take everything she has, and it won't be easy--4 months of chemo, followed by a mastectomy, and then months of radiation.Two nights ago, she had to share the news with her 5 year old daughter. Shyla has an ACTIVE imagination (you should hear this kid tell a story), so Tracy thought it was best to be honest with her. She told her about mommy's cancer and that she would be getting medicine that would make her lose her hair. ""The talk"" went well, and shortly after Shyla appeared with this picture she drew for her mom:￼￼As Shyla explained, this is a checklist. The top picture shows Tracy now, then a bald Tracy when her hair falls out. The third picture is the medicine, then a picture of Tracy with her hair growing back. And the last picture is Tracy ""when Mommy can do anything."" The boxes will be checked off as Tracy goes through each stage.I told you...the kid's brain is unbelievable.Tracy has an incredible support system--her fiance, Dustin, her parents, siblings and extended family, and a huge network of friends. What she doesn't have is the means to cover all her medical bills.  She is a straight commission salesperson, so if she's not working, she's not making money, and she will not be able to do her job while she battles this. So, her income will stop effective immediately. Dustin will also lose income as he makes sacrifices to care for Tracy and their daughter.As we spent an entire day at the cancer center on her 10 year anniversary with Dustin and the day of Shyla's first Christmas Concert, we talked about her fears --how her treatment would impact her family, how many more things in her life she would have to miss out on, her concern that they would have to sell the house they just purchased and have spent months fixing up. Here's the thing: my friend is a very proud person--she would be the first person to give you the shirt off her back, but struggles with asking for help. At that moment, the ""best friend tough love"" kicked in and I turned to her and said that she would get through this, but would ""have to suck up her pride and accept some help"" (with some curse words added in for effect). This is where you come in. You may know Tracy. Or she may be a complete stranger. But please know that whatever you choose to invest in her--her life, her family, her home and the future of that little girl with the HUGE imagination--it's going to an incredible human being and partner, a loving mother, a dedicated sister and daughter, and the best friend anyone could ask for. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you in advance for finding room in your heart to help this family.￼",b34d9c404316af70688d726438848fe9,32,0.77346,30.0,3,1,0,2,0,2,0,0.0024154589371980675,0.0,0.3945375258205187,4.252832455346523,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

Although her cancer was aggressive and being fed by a specific protein in her bloodstream, her prognosis was a 95% chance of survival. She underwent 5 surgeries, 6 rounds of chemo, and 28 rounds of radiation. After nearly a year of being ""cancer-free"", she began having severe back pain along with other concerning symptoms. Initial scans have revealed that the cancer has probably never left, and has since invaded her bones, from her ribs to her spine and all the way down to her knees. The prognosis is not good, and she has been told she only has 2-5 more years to spend with her family. She is currently in the process of getting a second opinion from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, where she will be evaluated for possible clinical trials and any other life-prolonging measures they can make. Her first appointment is set in the middle of October, and we hope to have better news at that time. Heather, a wife and mother of 3, is only 35 years old. She works at a bank in Waynesboro, GA, and has many friends and loved ones. She is quick to help anyone in need, and she is a wonderful and loving mother to her daughter(16) and two boys (5 and 3). She is still working, but the expenses are going to add up quickly, and the family needs help to finance the trips back and forth to Texas, the cancer treatments, and to supplement income for any time she and her husband, Toby, need off from work. We ask for thoughts and prayers, and any monetary donation you can spare to help them through this difficult time. If you cannot make a donation, please share her story with friends in the hopes that more prayers and donations can be made. We also ask that comments about her condition not be made in front of her youngest boys, as they will not be told of their mom's cancer returning until after she shows the effects of any cancer treatments.

His lung collapsed and he was rushed to Savannah Children’s Memorial Hospital. We fast forward a week and now know that a tumor was pressing upon Michael’s diaphragm, likely resulting in the collapse of his lung. Unfortunately this is the where the story begins. Michael’s mother, my dear friend, Jessica Mugrage, has been told that he has a rare form of sarcoma...a cancer that has begun to spread, to an extent that still remains unknown. I am personally connected to this family. He lives a few doors away from us. I sold them their home, and my 15 year old child is one of his few friends, as they are newly relocated to the area from Hawaii. I can personally vouch for the need that this family is experiencing. His mother Jessica was a successful realtor in Hawaii who is now new to the industry here and, as such, has already been struggling to make ends meet as a furniture salesperson at Haverty’s. She is a single mom with two truly exceptional boys and the future emotional and financial burden that she faces with this newfound diagnosis for her son is too heart wrenching for me to imagine. Our community is so amazing and I, along with my four children,  personally experienced this after the sudden loss of my husband last year. As a community , I am pleading that we rise up together and help Michael, his mother, Jessica, and sweet little brother Matthew right now in an effort to ease their financial burden so that they are able to focus on his recovery. His prognosis is not good and is truly a nightmare for any parent. Pray, give deeply, and please share...the costs of his care will far surpass what any parent, especially Jessica at the moment, could ever bear.  Jessica is my friend and her son is truly a sweet, caring, and very scared child right now.   She is literally living in the hospital in Savannah with him and doing what she can to farm out her sweet younger son Matthew to near strangers so that she can spend as much time as possible with Michael. I will update the moment I know more and continue to do so until this sweet child recovers.

When I woke from anesthesia, I was told that I had stage IV colon cancer and given a 14% chance of survival after 5 years. Before this diagnosis I did carpentry work and was always active. I took the kids to play at the park, baseball, skateboarding, anything to be outdoors.  How my life was about to change.... I never would have imagined.The funds we are trying to raise will be used for a secondary treatment. My oncologists said that I would need to do chemotherapy twice a month indefinitely.

And “inoperable” and “life threatening”. Our lives have been irreversibly altered. Our daughter has cancer. Our beautiful and innocent 11-year old now says, ""The whole side of my face is numb."" Hannah had complained of headaches. We thought it was a sinus infection. We have learned that a soft deadly mass, more than an inch wide had been silently growing inside her, next to her brain, without symptom or warning.  Does inoperable mean incurable? Medical science has made great progress and Hannah can benefit from these advances. The doctors tell us that there IS treatment. Chemotherapy CAN be successful, along with radiation. We raise our hopes. We are in the biggest battle of our lives.We have started aggressive chemotherapy. But Hannah needs an even more innovative approach that is not available in South Africa where we live. A new radiation therapy called Pencil Beam Proton Beam Therapy, that allows precise amounts of targeted radiation and does not damage surrounding tissue, is Hannah’s only option. The problem: Proton Beam Therapy is extremely (repeat, extremely) expensive. The solution: A long journey to a cutting-edge pediatric cancer facility. And $500,000.Five hundred thousand dollars to get the Proton Beam Radiation treatment and Chemotherapy to kill the cancer and save our daughter’s mental capacities so she can grow up and look forward to a normal life.  Like you, we’ve worked hard, been responsible, planned ahead, saved, but not enough to get the only therapy that has any chance of killing the cancer inside her without killing the brain that makes her who she is.  In the last few weeks, we have learned more about cancer treatment than we ever wanted to know. Hannah’s hair has fallen out, and she has shown strength none of us knew she had.

I am married to my high school sweetheart, Caroline, of 20 years & we have 3 beautiful children: our son Addison (9), daughter Atlanta (5) & youngest son Arthur (3). I am 35 years old. My family has been hit with CANCER for the 2nd time in less than 6 months. First, my father is diagnosed in May of this year with terminal brain cancer, praise God he is alive & doing well. Now ME! This past spring I first noticed two lumps  on the right side of my neck. After doing a bit of research I simply thought nothing of them as I had no other symptoms. In August, two more lumps showed up, one under my chin & the other on my left clavical. I decided to see my PCP just to be safe. After an ultrasound & blood work I pretty much was no longer concerned because blood work was great & all my doctor said was I had swollen lymph nodes. He did suggest I see an ENT specialist to just confirm that, so I scheduled an appointment for early September. On Labor Day, Monday evening 9/7 I headed to OKC from Tulsa to begin 2 weeks of training for my new job as a loan officer with Cornerstone Home Lending. On Wednesday, just two days after I arrived, I was awakend at 5:00am to the worst headache I had ever experienced in my life & I don't ever get headaches. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the highest this was a 12. Those persisted every day & mainly at night for the next 8 days. In fact some nights I couldn't sleep at all & was up all night before needing to go to the CHL office for 8 hours of training. In the middle of this I was having soaking wet night sweats, which now I realize had been happening for 2 months even at home (not soaking wet one's, but still night sweats). I played in a tennis tournament that weekend & actually won it & even passed my Oklahoma state mortgage exam, all by the grace of God. I bought reading glasses thinking that might help my headaches, I went to a chiropractor 3 days in a row, but nothing would releave them. Wednesday evening, September 16th I again spoke with my MD friend in OKC & told him about these swollen lymph nodes. He said to visit his clinic in the morning so he could take a look at the lymph nodes and perform an eye exam. Once he saw my lymph nodes he immediately said that my left clavical was a Virchow's Node & that was a sign of Cancer. I headed home 2 days early from OKC to get MRI's done asap. On Friday night the 18th of September, I had 3 MRI's: brain, neck and abdomen. My doctor called me the next day to inform me that the neck & stomach were of concern as lymph nodes were ""lighting up all over the place"" & he was concerned it was lymphoma cancer. Next step was a biopsy of a node to confirm that fear. The following Tuesday I had a consultation with a surgeon. He said he was 99.9% sure I had lymphoma as you could feel the nodes from my groin area to my neck & everywhere in between including my arm pits. The biopsy surgery was performed on Thursday, September 24th, 2015.On Tuesday, September 29th,  we met with the surgeon to go over the results of the biopsy & sure enough it was B-cell Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma Cancer and they believe is a minimum of stage 3 & possibly stage 4. It appears to be fast growing & aggressive & progressing quickly. Of course that is not an easy report to hear no matter who you are & what you believe. At this point we have already encurred a tremendous amount of expenses as our fight to beat cancer begins. It's as if an entirely 2nd life is added on to what you already live in your normal life which doesn't slow down or stop for anything, including cancer. In order to attack this with nutrition, natural therapies & much more it will be extremely expensive over the next 6 to 12 months, perhaps as much as $50,000 or more on top of all our normal expenses. With both my wife Caroline & I being on 100% commission & me just starting a new job, it's not the most ideal time for us financially to be facing this challenge. There is no way realistically that her nor I can work during this time at the same capacity we would normally be able to. We are both still working & will continue to as much as humanly possible. It's going to take little to no stress, lots of time & a huge amount of financial resources to beat cancer in the most effective way possible. I have literally seen my life flash before my eyes in the past 10 days. I can't imagine not living as I LOVE my life & my family. We will be happy to detail out our specifics needs for anyone who wants to help us financially or feels led to support. These expenses include, but are not limited to   health & nutrition changes regarding food, supplements, herbs, certain machines, specific lymphatic system therapies, medical consultations and treatments. We have already begun the road back to health and believe combining all of these treatments is what is necessary to have the best chance of me WINNING. In addition, we will also have much of our normal work time eaten up with the time it takes to beat cancer & that cost us lots of money. Please feel free to email us at the email provided if you would like to know more specifics on what your hard earned money will go towards.


I will tell you this. It's going to a family who wants their husband, daddy, brother & son to live a long life & is going to do everything humanly possible to not only beat cancer but live cancer free for the rest of my days. It will go to give us the resources to make decisions that increase my odds dramatically that we just can't make without this financial support. You are literally investing in my life to save my life & a THANK YOU is honestly not even enough.

She has suffered through long chemo sessions, hair loss, a bone marrow transplant, Graft vs. Host Disease complications, T Cell therapy, arthritis in her legs and uveitis in her eye, as well as the little every day hardships like spending what should be carefree childhood days in a hospital bed. She has spent too much of her young life carrying this terrible burden. But she is not giving up her fight against cancer. And neither are we. Her mom and dad are both teachers who have been doing the best they can. Much of Avrie’s treatment is at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and the expense of frequently leaving the Rochester, NY area only adds to the already sizable hospital bills that must be paid to continue to give Avrie hope.

You know those almost too good to be true type feelings that you hope is nothing more than you just overthinking. Well what happens when your feeling is right?I thought I was on top of the world. I had just done my first bodybuilding show, I was doing well in my career, I loved my family and amazing friends. Nothing could go wrong for me.Well that is until that one fateful trip to the Oncologist to review my bloodwork. I had gotten blood work done in November of 2016 where my doctor noticed that my white blood cell count was a little too high. About 4 times the normal ""high"" amount. Concerned, I looked into it a little further and got some more blood work with an oncologist thinking that everything would be fine. Fast forward to Friday, January 13, 2017. I meet with my oncologist and I hear the words ""you have CANCER."" I was diagnosed with Leukemia and Lymphoma. This is news that no one would ever want to hear for themselves or their loved ones. Many questions ran through my head for quite of while such as ""how? Why? Why me? What next? What does this mean?"" Etc.The fact of the matter is that it happened and I have it and being sad about it doesn't help anyone I know feel better or help myself get better. After additional testings I found out that I have a rare mutation of Leukemia. The 17P deletion mutation. This mutation is very resistant to treatment and harder to cure. After speaking with my doctors, we decided that a bone marrow transplant would be the best course of action to try to beat this cancer and eventually live a normal life. Unfortunately with that he had to throw in the caveat that its about a 50/50 shot to make it through the procedure. Hard to believe that the outcome of my future just changed so fast, but I am young and I am strong and I am here to fight. I don't believe my time is up yet, and I'm going to do everything in my power to keep it that way.Fortunately Insurance does cover most of the procedures. The out of pocket portion and procedures not covered look to be around $40,000.00.

Your support will go towards medical bills, mortgage payments, utilities, and treatments needed to help us get through this difficult holiday season. We have created an account tied to GoFundMe for my father specifically for this cause.ABOUT NICK:To many, our Dad is known as charismatic, outgoing, and a spunky guy who will give you his shirt off his back even if he has nothing of his own to replace it. A man that came to this country with nothing, and started his own business to support his family. A man who has spent almost 40 years of his life working every day and night landscaping yards all around the east bay and making friends a long the way. One of those guys who when his name mentioned, you always hear; “Oh you know Nick?! What a wonderful character! He helped us with….”. A man that is known in the Greek Community as “The Cretan” because of his big moustache and even bigger personality. To us, his 3 daughters, he is our amazing Dad or “Baba”. He has taught us about hard work and determination, and he always went the extra mile to make sure we had what we needed throughout our childhood. Unfortunately, Cancer chose him earlier this year. Being self-employed and now unable to work, he is now in a position where medical costs, mortgage payments, and bills are piling up and adding additional stress on his health. Uncertainty weighs heavy on him and his entire family as we all struggle to get through each day, week, and month. With that being said, with humility and grace, we ask who my father has helped, inspired, delighted, or made smile to help our family financially in this difficult time.BACKGROUND:Our Dad was diagnosed with Stage 4 Renal Cell Carcinoma (aka Kidney Cancer) in March 2017. It took an exhausting and scary few months to determine what was causing all the debilitating symptoms (weakness, uncontrollable cough, stomach pain, etc… ). The ultimate diagnosis was that he had an enormous mass (12 cm x 8 cm) engulfing his left kidney and attaching to his intestinal wall. This past Summer he underwent a successful Radical Nephrectomy (removal) of his left kidney and subsequent removal of 6 inches of his bowels. Nick recovered from the surgery and was able to walk his daughter Dena down the aisle on her wedding day on June 10th. What an emotional moment for us all! Unfortunately, in additional scans the following week, we found out the cancer had metastasized and has spread beyond his kidney and into his left lung. It was devastating news. Of course, our thought was to have another surgery again to remove the new lung tumor. It was growing rapidly and we were concerned that it would spread into his bones and other organs. As we prepared for another surgery, we received more bad news. The week before the scheduled surgery, our Nick began to throw up blood and was rushed to the ER. Through CT scans, we found a large blood clot and tumor embolism in his right lung. Due to the blood clot and tumor embolism in his right lung, it would be fatal to now attempt a surgery as both lungs are at risk. The tumor in his lung has now grown, as well as the blood clot and tumor emboli. We have now reached the point of immunotherapy (Systemic IV Treatment; similar to chemo), which my father has been undergoing now for a few months with no improvements. Through all these hurdles my father's spirit has remained strong, but his energy and physical strength are in a downward spiral. His deteriorating health and energy levels make working difficult on most days and impossible on others. With very little income and a monthly mortgage payment and medical bills, we must make some difficult decisions. Nick must sell the business he built over 40 years, as well as the home in which he raised three beautiful daughters. With Winter in front of us, no offers on the business and home, and our father no longer able to work, financial support is needed to get our mother and father through this difficult time. It breaks our heart to see our father deteriorate as he is someone who has given money, fed, and provided those in need with shelter, safety, and comfort over these years. The financial struggles currently and continue to come are real for our family now, with his treatments in process, and as much pride that our family holds, we cannot do this alone.OUR ASK:We now ask for help during this holiday season to help with the overwhelming financial burdens as he can no longer work. The money donated will go to his medical bills, mortgage payments, utilities, food, and treatments needed to help him fight his stage 4 cancer! If your own personal situation would make it difficult to donate funds, we ask for your prayer that God will continue to provide and that you help us spread this donation message on your social feed to drive awareness. If your own financial security allows you to help, we ask that you donate what you can to help Nick and his family through this difficult time.

The staff at the clinic know her well and her smile and positivity every single time we visit is admired. Not much gets my Mum down, but losing her hair was one of those moments. I could see the impact it had on her and can only imagine what others experience. As such I have been growing my hair since the day that she lost hers (nearly 3 years ago now) and will be cutting it off in June to donate it to make a wig for someone who needs a confidence boost, to try and help someone else with a journey that is not an easy one!I told Mum about my goals and she would like to make a special mention to her Breast Care Nurse - someone she refers to as her Angel. Breast Care Nurses supported by the McGrath Foundation not only provide support and encouragement to their patients through what can be a tough time, but they are a critical part of someone's life.The funds raised will go towards a few things, first will be a donation for the McGrath Foundation to help provide much needed funds for a Breast Care Nurse, my hair will go to Variety along with a donation to make a wig for someone in need and some will also go to my Mum to assist with her treatment and transport costs.I'm looking forward to June (even though I'm a bit nervous - I've become quite attached to my long locks over the years!) and would like to thank you all in advance for your support. #mybighaircutforcancer",1883fea44f815cc254fdee0f877a7a40,11,0.586,720.0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I have two loving parents, and a beautiful sister who I wouldn't trade the world for! Things I love to do involve YouTubing, gaming, vlogging, and anything to do with cars!  I enjoy playing soccer and basketball too, and look forward to playing again once I'm better! I have been fighting Stage 4 Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor cancer or GIST since the begining of May of 2015. What is GIST? GIST Cancer is an extremely rare Sarcoma, and makes up less than 6% of all Sarcoma cases every year. Common mutations (my mutation) of GIST are aggressive and adaptive, and in other words, a scary combination! Almost having been free of tumors for nearly a year, working a full time job, feeling almost completely free of disease and worry, recently new lesions/tumors have begun growing rapidly, and spreading out of control to surrounding organs outside of the intestines, such as the liver, colon, lungs, and I now have more than 14+ tumors located inside of my body. The tumors cause me extreme pain, discomfort, and hinder my ability to move normally at times, and these tumors have continued to grow in size, latching onto tissues, nerves, and other areas of the organs. As my cancer has now progressed, I was recently given by my Oncologist a grim timeline of 3-6 MONTHS to live if treatments continue to fail, as two different frontline drugs have failed already. Unfourtunately, GIST Cancer is NOT affected by ChemoTherapy, and my options for second-line treatments are slim to none. I have had to sell my gaming equipment to pay for the treatment expenses. Alongside this, I recently totalled my car, lost my job because of my disease, and can barely support myself with everyday life. My financial situation is grim, and is a huge stress ball in life as I still am fighting for my life on a day to day basis.  My goal is simple, yet seemingly so hard right now, and that is to achieve financial stability so I can focus on my REAL fight; cancer. This money is to help pay for treatments 100% and to help take financial stress of cancer bills off my chest. My DREAM would be to travel the world advoacting for people fighting cancer, and to share my experiences with others!

They were located in the left frontal lobe and had to be removed.  Surgeons had informed us that 2 would not be able to be removed because they were too deep and close to critical parts. So critical that if attempted to remove, could more than likely paralyze her. The mass itself was the size of an average egg, but the swelling in her brain was double that size.  On May 10, 2018 open brain surgery was preformed to remove the mass/tumor having left two behind. The mass was successfully removed as planned. ￼  The results of a malignant brain tumor had set her on this long course of radiation and chemotherapy treatment.  We will be starting friendships with doctors at Duke Hospital and Novant health who are tumor specialist with this kind of brain cancer. I'm sure there will be several more medical staff in and out too.  Although all of this seems to be overwhelming I find that God grabs a hold of us and shakes our sufferings up a bit to remind us his hand is on us. ￼  This is a stubborn, fast growing, aggressive cancer that will need to be treated aggressively and concurrently.  To stir the pot, she had started a new career and is set on the standard probationary period waiting on insurance. She is currently uninsured and her employment is on hold as well as her probationary period. Since this incident, her company has put her on a leave of absense; She cannot work and her life has dramatically changed in ways she could never have imagined.  This is the most challenging thing my mother has ever had to go through. We are asking for your help with this and promise that if there are any funds left we will pay them forward to someone else facing this tough fight.￼  My mother Tonya, is the most incredible woman I have ever met. A little bias you say? Of course but ask everyone else in line that agrees. She has so much love for her family, friends and grand babies. She has endlessly given to others just to brighten anyone’s day. So much of her goes into everything she does for others whether it’s by money, time, gifts, positivity etc. She always makes sure EVERYONE she knows is taken care of and always putting herself last. Let’s come together and show how much we love her and want to help her RID this!! Any and everything counts! This would be one big step forward to a stress free treatment process. ￼  Funds would go toward the fight, treatment and expenses toward facilitating her treatments. Food, lodging, gas and any other included to medical. Not only towards treatment, but towards her every day bills as well. Money is the very last thing I want her having to worry about at this point. All of this together is going to cost our family financially and mentally. I am not one to normally ask for anything and especially not her. However, this is my mother and I can't think of living in this world without her.￼  You'll be able to see all her updates; her brain cancer program; etc on my Facebook page.  ￼WE PRAY FOR HER A LONG LIFE, FREE OF PAIN AND SUFFERING AS WELL AS STRONG FAITH IN GOD TO ALLOW HER TO TRUST HIM IN DARKNESS AND IN LIGHT.￼",bed3d835e94a46278c116df9bb38f1b3,38,0.10125,240.0,2,1,0,2,0,1,0,0.0030627871362940277,0.0,0.6072524407252441,2.0,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

In other words, the radiation I received 25 years ago to treat my lymphoma is the underlying cause of this breast cancer. I will fight and beat this cancer just as I did the other! I know from experience that it is the power of prayer, positive thinking, and being surrounded by so much love that I will allow me to persevere and help my body find its way to good health once again.” - Gina GuthrieMy name is Alicia Carlin and I am a sister of Theta Phi Alpha Fraternity’s Beta Upsilon chapter at Saint Leo University. This year, for Theta Phi’s annual Rock Against Cancer event, we are honoring Gina Guthrie (or Aunt Gina as I call her)! Gina and my Mom met at the University of Florida during their undergraduate career and have been friends ever since. Fun fact: Gina found her Greek home at the University of Florida as a Kappa Delta. At 22 years old, upon graduation, Gina was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. As a result she received 12 rounds of chemotherapy followed by seven weeks of radiation. After extensive treatment and by the grace of God, Gina was cured of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. She continued with life, married her husband Mike, and together they had two children – Mia and Mike Jr. Mike and Gina’s children are such a God-given blessing because after her first round with cancer Gina was told there was only a 30% chance of having children. Gina currently owns and operates her own out-of-home business called Bocca Felice (“happy mouth” in Italian) which combines her passions of healthy eating, cooking, and serving others. She caters events such as banquets and weddings and uses all locally-grown, farm fresh ingredients. Gina was cancer free for 25 years, until the summer of 2017 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. However, it was concluded that the development of breast cancer was directly linked to the radiation treatment from Hodgkin’s lymphoma. On September 5, 2017 she underwent a bilateral mastectomy. The bilateral mastectomy was a success in that it not only removed the residual margin of the original 2.5cm tumor that we knew existed and had removed via lumpectomy on 5/25, but it also discovered an additional undetected 5.5cm tumor that had been hiding from mammography, along with 10/11 lymph nodes that contained disease. She recovered from surgery well but had to start back up on chemotherapy and radiation within a few weeks. From October 2017 to January 2018 she received six treatments of chemotherapy. Radiation treatments are up next, but she recently finished a visit from MD Anderson in Houston, Texas to possibly be a part of a radiation trial. Despite the devastating reality of cancer that Gina has lived and is currently living, she remains prayerful and radiates joy. She is truly a warrior, a powerful woman of God, and someone I look up to!",723122931db2e052b29ee61075e9b93f,22,0.6944,300.0,0,1,0,2,0,2,0,0.0038022813688212928,0.0,0.10318257956448912,2.868261645268759,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

Thank you again for your unwavering support – it means the world to the McPhee family.Celebration of Life for Ed McPheeSaturday, August 25, 20186:00 PM – 11:30 PMHMCS NCSM Nonsuch11807 Kingsway Avenue, Edmonton, AlbertaEd was an incredibly special man that left a lasting impression on anyone and everyone he met. He was deeply and dearly loved by an abundance of family and friends. He lived life to the fullest with a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eye. In honor of the way he lived, his family has planned a celebration of life, to be held this Saturday, August 25th from 6:00 PM to 11:30 PM. Please visit  https://www.facebook.com/events/233443364037898 for additional details and to confirm attendance.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Life can change in an instant.These words rang loud and clear for the McPhee family just 3 weeks ago when Ed, suspecting he was experiencing symptoms of a simple food intolerance, was suddenly and unexpectedly diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon Cancer.In an instant life was turned upside down for Ed, wife Natalia, and daughters McKenzie (11) and Kiersten (13). Suddenly, promises of carefree summer days and exciting family adventures were replaced with shock, stress, uncertainty and immense fear of what lay ahead in the days, weeks, months to come. In an instant, Ed went from being in seemingly good health to learning that not only did he have colon cancer, but that the cancer had spread to his spine, liver, pancreas and spleen. Due to its complexity, the treatment plan will be long and exhausting. Having already undergone an ileostomy, Ed is now in the process of starting chemotherapy and radiation. Once this part of treatment is complete, doctors will then go in to remove the grapefruit-sized tumor from his intestine. Because Ed will be unable to return to work and will be in need of his wife’s continuous support emotionally, mentally and physically during this time, the McPhee family will undoubtedly be impacted financially by this devastating disease.As family and friends learn of this news, many are reaching out to offer help and support in any way that they can. Those that would like to make monetary contributions in support of the McPhee family as they say “F*CK CANCER!""  can easily and safely do so through this fundraising platform. We thank you a million times over for your love, support and generosity -- it is truly and deeply appreciated.",7c24d14998da340902dcbf701bf39f3a,20,0.6890333333333334,150.0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Happy birthday beautiful girl. She is a loving daughter, granddaughter, sister, niece, cousin, and friend. She loves cheerleading, swimming, and her friends. Krystal has a brother (Rylan) and a sister (Kaylee) on her moms side of the family and a sister (Jackie) on her dads side of the family. Krystal is fighting for her life.December 26th, 2017:My niece Krystal was finishing up with her school cheerleading as she continued to complain of constant knee pain. Her knee appeared to be swollen so her mother Allison scheduled her an appointment to get her into the dr. Allison and I brought her to the dr where they believed she had a minor injury to her knee from cheering and referred her to physical therapy to see if that would help. Krystal was placed on crutches and expected to stay off her left leg to help reduce the swelling.January 11th, 2018:Krystal had been staying off her leg and we noticed the swelling still hadn’t gone down. She attended her physical therapy session where her physical therapist showed high concerns about the swelling in Krystal’s left knee. She insisted that we go in and see an orthopedic surgeon IMMEDIATELY! Before Krystal and Allison left her physical therapy session Allison made sure to have her appointment scheduled the next day with Dr. Kauffman an orthopedic surgeon for Northwestern Hospital.January 12th, 2018:The day our entire universe changed....1:30pm- Allison was unable to take time off work so she asked her Aunt Cathy to bring Krystal to her orthopedic appointment. She held her phone close by incase any questions needed to be answered. When arriving at Dr. Kauffmans office they did an X-ray of both of Krystal’s knees. A dark gray area showed up on Krystal’s left knee. Dr. Kauffman stepped out of the room to review the images and upon arriving he told Aunt Cathy and Krystal that he cannot discuss any results without Allison on the phone. While at work, Allison stepped away to take a phone call that would shatter her entire world. Dr. Kauffman explained that he was VERY concerned about her knee. The X-ray images are showing cells rapidly growing in her knee and that an MRI was needed to find out where exactly these cells are and how bad it really is. He then proceeded to say that he was going to place a referral for Dr. Peabody and Dr. Attar who are Orthopedic ONCOLOGISTS.... that one word is when Allison’s heart skipped a million beats and the tears started flowing. Dr. Kauffman then explained that he will not let Krystal leave his office until she gets scheduled for an MRI.3pm- Krystal, Aunt Cathy, her mom Allison, and her dad Miguel all arrived at the radiology department for the MRI. Krystal wanted Allison to be there during the MRI so the radiology tech took them both back while everyone waited in the waiting room. Krystal started her MRI and did so good reguardless of how scarred she was. She enjoyed listening to today’s hits in her head phones. For her, she still had no idea what was going on or what this all meant. Allison stood back by the radiology tech where she was able to see all the images that were being taken. Tears rolling down her face, she knew it didn’t look good. Krystal then needed to have contrast added. Allison was so worried with how she would handle the injection of die. Allison stood by her side, holding her hand, assuring everything would be ok. Krystal handled it like a CHAMP! We were so proud of her! After the MRI was all said and done we were heading out of the building and Dr. Kauffman was already calling Allison and Miguel with the results. Relentless to wanting to pick up the phone, they sat in the main lobby to hear the results. Dr. Kauffman stated that it appeared to be what he thought it was, a TUMOR. He said that Krystal needs to get to the oncologist immediately and that his staff was coordinating the day (January 18th, 2018) to get downtown where they will do a biopsy to see what stage she is and if it has spread to any other parts of the body. He stated he has no reason to believe that it has spread but we won’t know until she has further imaging. He advised to take time off work and spend as much time with Krystal as possible. -The next 72 hours have been emotional to say the least. They say when someone in the family has cancer, everybody has cancer. That statement couldn’t be more true. We have had an enormous amount of people reaching out with such kind encouraging words, asking how they could help, and delivering meals to Krystal’s house to help eliminate one less worry. I have made this go fund me account to help my niece Krystal and her family afford the endless amount of medical bills heading their way, maintain their house payments, care for Krystal’s siblings, transportation/parking, and to put food on the table. No family should have to battle cancer alone!

The pediatrician believed Caden was suffering from Nystagmus, a condition in which one’s eyes make repetitive, un-controlled movements from side to side.  Caden was referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist, who saw him the very next day.  The ophthalmologist confirmed the Nystagmus but determined it was not caused by anything having to do specifically with Caden’s vision or eyes.  Katie and Chris were told to bring Caden to Fairfax Hospital for a CT right away, bypassing INOVA Loudoun for fear if there was any significant treatment, Loudoun would not be able to accommodate.  Katie, Chris and Caden were rushed in to a CT moments after arriving at the ER at INOVA Fairfax Hospital. The CT was read quickly and within an hour of arriving, the ER doctor was notifying Katie and Chris that their son had a tumor on his brain and it measured 4cm, a very large mass for anyone, let alone 6 month old, Caden.  The tumor was sitting directly in the middle of Caden’s brain, this was obviously the cause of the Nystagmus. Caden was immediately admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Children’s Fairfax Hospital where he, Katie and Chris remain today.  It was quickly apparent that Caden would soon be undergoing brain surgery in an attempt to remove as much of the tumor as possible as well as to diagnose exactly what type of tumor this is.  After more tests and MRIs Caden was brought in to surgery on the morning of Friday, January 20 around 7:00am.  Surgery was scheduled to take 4-6 hours per the surgeons estimate.  Katie and Chris along with their parents waited patiently for each update from the operating room.  Updates were expected every two hours during surgery – the first one finally came about 2.5-3 hours from when Caden went in – everything was progressing as planned.  The updates continued to come as the hours continued to pass.  After 11 hours, Caden was out of surgery!  A long, grueling day for the family indeed.  Finally, they were able to see Caden! Shortly after surgery, Caden began having seizures – multiple seizures each day for the first few days post-op.  This is not completely out of the ordinary after one goes through the extensive brain surgery had just come through, however, difficult for all involved.Katie and Chris were told that the pathology results which may help identify the type of tumor could take 7-10 business days before they were returned.  The wait was not that long and came back on Thursday – the diagnosis of the tumor is PNET (Primitive neuroectodermal tumor), a malignant, obviously aggressive tumor. During surgery the doctor was able to remove a significant amount of the tumor, however there is still a long road ahead to attack and hopefully kill the remaining malignant cells.  The next course of treatment will be 9 months of chemotherapy.  Katie and Chris will be with Caden at Children’s in Fairfax for one week out of the month for the next 9 months.  The other 3 weeks per month will be spent at home, essentially providing Caden time to recover from the last and prepare for the next round of chemo.The doctors and family agree this is the best course of action in hopes of eliminating this tumor.  There will inevitably be ups and downs along the way.  One of those I have not yet mentioned was a curveball thrown just hours before Caden’s 6 month pediatrician visit when Katie was laid off from her job.  The hopes of sharing this story is to help relieve one of many burdens facing Katie, Chris, Sydney, Laynie, Caden and family.  During chemo, Chris will have to take time from work, where his paid time off will be expiring any day now.  If we can help this family who has been there for so many of us in our times of need, big or small – it would be so incredibly appreciated.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me through the site.I have started with the amount of $25,000 as we really have no idea what to expect. Chris and Katie have made is crystal clear that if any money raised exceeds the needs of Caden’s care, it will be donated to cancer research in Caden’s name. As always, thoughts and prayers are so graciously accepted as well!",46007bf80afd5d943165b5fe92c5acbe,34,1.37572,720.0,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

That was the time when i first saw her with that disease at the airport. Rolling on a wheelchair  with my sister, my tears fell off from my eyes, couldn't control it after i saw her in many years and could hardly believe it was her. Even after then i had to control my self and guide her through every possible way to treat her disease after all i am the only son. It went all good for a year. She regained some weight and we were happy until the time it was seen again on her peritoneum. As soon as we knew that it was seen again, we started chemotherapy in Nepal cancer hospital.She underwent for ten cycles of chemotherapy. The disease did not grew for that period of time and also did not show  any improvement. After a year, more cancer cells started to grow again in the abdomen and pelvic region. As it is malignant (Spreading of tumor rapidly); the tumor rapidly grew in the peritoneum and some part of liver (case of Primary Liver Cancer). The tumor also spread widely in the inner intestines as well. With this, she started having ascites in her peritoneum which made the condition more worse than ever.  Then on march 2018, with the help you all, we quickly took her to china for further treatment. She underwent Immunotherapy and ascites along with chemotherapy. The expenses in China was around $25000. After a month as she came back to Nepal, the condition started becoming the same again. I flew to Nepal and took her to Manipal hospital in Banglore, India hoping for other possible treatment as the doctors from Nepal had already given up. She then was again hospitalized and after more diagnosis, the hope of HIPEC surgery was seen but the tumor then and now is so big that she again has to go through several chemotherapy in order to minimize the size and the hardness of the tumor and then gain her weight to be ready for the surgery. Being the treatment so expensive there in Banglore, we decided to give her the same chemo medicines that the doctor had prescribed from Manipal hospital. HIPEC is a very expensive method of treatment and is the last resort for patients who are struggling for their lives. This treatment is only performed in few hospitals worldwide as is very advanced procedure. Being a middle-class family in Nepal, we are unable to afford this treatment. It is said to cost around $25000 just for the HIPEC procedure.  These are all seen bills. Everyone knows that how expensive can medical bills be for the patients suffering from Cancer. The expenses are countless as you all know. There are lots of more spending to be made. We are waiting for the major HIPEC surgery to be done.As you all have heard by now that I was deported from United states recently. Everyone surely understands that every penny counts and that's what i was working on back in United states, supporting my mom to cure her in every possible way. But the situation has changed now. She needs supporters which i could't be. So, I hereby request you all to help me in this current time. Every small amount you donate will count towards the treatment. My Mom is the rock of our lives and has always inspired us to live as honest and respectful person. She is one of the strongest person I know, and even the cancer has not been able to shake her strong personality. She has a strong belief that she can recover and get back to her normal healthy life. Please, help a helpless son in his struggles to keep his mother alive. All the helps are extremely appreciated. Also i would like to present my full gratitude towards my friend Pabitra khatri who has been helping me with the account management.May God look upon us all.

Everyone that knows Kannon knows him to be a very sweet, silly and kind hearted young man. He has always been very active whether he was participating in recreational sports, school sports, or just activities around the house or with friends.  In March, he started to develop a lump on the back of his leg that was thought to be just a cyst.  On 4/12 he went in for surgery to remove the abscess, and tests were ran on it.  On 4/18 when he went back for a follow up post surgery, he was told that at just 15 years old, he had been diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma (bone cancer).  Ewing's Sarcoma is an extremely rare cancer that typically affects children and young adults.  While it is most commonly found within the bones, Kannon's has been found within his soft tissue. His treatment for this will require multiple rounds of chemotherapy, then surgery, then more rounds of chemo.  He will be admitted 2/3 days for treatment, and then the following week of treatment for 5 days.  This is estimated to continue for about 6-8 months. His treatment is not close to home, and his parents own and run their own company back in their resident city.  However with this going on, of course Kannon is their main priority so they are spending every moment they can with him at home, at the hospital and at all appointments.  With that said, any donations from family/friends/the community would be GREATLY appreciated to help with any medical/travel expenses.  Although he is still at the beginning of his long journey, he is already fighting like a bull! He is such a positive, determined, and enthusiastic young man.  He knows he can beat this, especially with all the love and support he has gotten from everyone around him.  He is strong and he will remain #KannonFierce!

My awesomely brave sister Alice is included in this statistic, diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer earlier in July. We all have a story to tell; you know, those ones that just completely throw your life upside down, and hers is just crazy. Alice has been living in Indonesia the last 2.5 years developing a career in the regions disaster management sector and in her spare time falling in love with her now husband Danu. Two days before Alice and Danu tied the knot on the 11th June, trying on her wedding dress (Kebaya) for the final time, she found a lump in her right breast. After an initial consultation with a local GP and then an oncologist, she was confidently told by both professionals that her cancer was benign; nothing to worry about, ‘this happens all the time’. Following up with a second opinion, Alice and Danu travelled to Singapore and after some rigorous tests, she was diagnosed with a very real and aggressive tumour. Not the most expected news, given prior diagnoses. Nor with the knowledge that only a week or two prior, Alice and Danu also found out they were pregnant. Alice chose to return to Australia for treatment and since returning in early August has been embraced by a rockstar medical team including a breast cancer surgeon, oncologist, breast care nurse, social worker, obstetrician and midwife. Which we all can/t thank enough.It was all hands on deck, including their determination to fight this while keeping the pregnancy. Something Alice and Danu were informed back in Singapore would not be a possibility to continue. After her first surgery in late August to remove the tumour, histopathology found the lump was a lot bigger, a whole 5.3cm bigger, than originally measured in the tests, of around 2cm. A second surgery followed in early September to remove a larger margin – or non-cancerous tissue – around the removed tumour. Better to be sure! Histopathology results found at this point that the removed margins were riddled with an inconsistent pattern of tumorous “nests”. Given it was clear that going in for more surgery was a fruitless venture, aside now a mastectomy, and also safely developing beyond the first trimester of pregnancy, Alice has now commenced chemotherapy treatment. Chemo will continue now for the next 6 to 7 months with the intent to stop it at her 35th week of pregnancy in early February to provide her and bubs the best chance for a normal birth untainted or exposed to any chemo. Then back into it. A mastectomy, completion of the chemo and then a course of radiation therapy. In a nutshell. When she’s good, she’s pretty good. When she’s going through her post-chemo (of what she calls) “drano” periods, she’s pretty well knocked out. Having never been pregnant nor ever had chemo, she undergoes an ongoing guessing game between what is pregnancy nausea and symptoms, and what is a result of the chemo. But on she persists. So, now I would like to do my bit to help.

Unfortunately, post-surgery blood work showed that the cancer cells had spread into his Lymph nodes and lungs.  Through this, Brad's doctors still ensure him that there is a 99% cure rate with his type of cancer through chemotherapy treatments.  Brad has just started his 1st round of Chemo in January and will have 3 rounds total for a 9 week period. Throughout all of this Brad has been very upbeat and taking every step with a positive attitude. We are all confident that following the chemo this will only be a piece of Brad's past. The unfortunate piece of this is that Brad's medical plan does not put a cap on out of pocket medical expenses. Your support through any amount of donation to help out with the medical costs during this time are greatly appreciated!Brad and his Fiancé, Chris just bought a house and are planning a wedding. Any help with these medical costs would help them tremendously.

Our daughter, Ariana Farragut, was your normal fun, crazy, sweet little girl 25 days ago on November 10, 2014. On Nov. 11 she was playing and hit her head. Not a big deal, so we thought. That night, Ariana started walking funny and vomiting a lot. We immediately thought concussion, but we waited to see how she was the next day.The next morning Nov 12 we took her to the pediatrician, and we were sent to the hospital for a CT to rule out a concussion.  At that time, we were so worried it was a concussion... Little did we know!The CT showed a possible cyst or tumor in her brain. We were given a few choices on places for an MRI, as kids have to be sedated. We decided on Children's hospital in New Orleans, in case it was worse-case scenario. We were admitted through the ER at Children's  that afternoon... They took us straight to the cancer floor without telling us anything, and I almost threw up. I told Lee it must be a mistake and the other rooms were full... After a lot of talks with doctors, our heads spinning, we were told it was a tumor, and it would need to be operated on, BUT at the moment we had a bigger issue. The CT showed so much fluid on the brain, Ariana needed immediate surgery to put in an exterior ventricular drain. That surgery was about 5:30 or 6 on Nov 12.  We met with our neurosurgeon, and he showed us and told us the tumor was LARGE. It was also attached to important high-functioning areas of the brain. Then she had a brain surgery on Nov 18 to try to get the tumor out. She made it through surgery wonderfully.  Doctors, nurses, everyone was pleasantly surprised. We had an MRI the next day.... To see how the tumor looked... And we got the news that 1/3 of the tumor remained. Dr. Roberts felt that he could get more out if he went in a second time, and so we put our trust in that.Ariana's second brain surgery was Nov 20. Dr Roberts knew he got all he could, but that some still remained.  After THAT MRI,  we found out 20% is still in there.We got her oncology report Nov. 21, 2014 on Ariana's 2nd birthday. She was diagnosed with ATRT, a VERY rare, malignant, stage 4 cancer.  We knew we needed the best treatment possible, so we reached out to St Jude.Ariana's pressures were great, so they turned off the EVD. Then, the CTs were good, so they took out the EVD.  She was sweating from all the steroids and antibiotics, or so we thought... We later found out she was leaking brain fluid from her stitches...and so she had her FOURTH surgery on Dec.5 to put in a shunt. She also got a virus while in the hospital. We have now been here 23 days, 13 in ICU, and we HOPE to be well enough to go to St. Jude SOON! We need treatment, and we need it fast.---Ariana has since had 2 more surgeries- a port and another tumor resection. (Total of 6 surgeries) She has had 4 months of high dose IV chemo, 6 weeks of proton radiation to the brain, and 6 months of oral maintenance chemo. She has had several seizures and a lot of neuropathic pain. She is not cancer-free, but she WILL be! Please help us as we help Ariana FIGHT for her life!iWe appreciate everything, and we are especially grateful for the prayers...

My life used to be as normal as any other 24 year old woman. I was out in D.C. for Spring Break and studying for midterms for law school. Everything around me seemed to change when I found out that I was diagnosed with Stage III Colon Cancer. I faced many hardships finishing my last semester of school while going through several doctor appointments to find a specialist and running several tests like CT scans, MRI’s, and blood tests. I had surgery to remove the tumor, and was told there was a 50% chance that I wouldn’t need chemo. However, the pathologists reports came back and 3 lymph nodes were positive, so now I am preparing for chemo treatments for the next 6 months. These treatments are very expensive and consists of getting another procedure done that includes getting a port placed in my chest for all the medicine and blood work to be placed in or buying expensive pills that my insurance will not cover. I will need to go back to Duke every two to three weeks for the infusion. In addition to fighting cancer, I am also studying for the NC bar this summer to become a licensed attorney, and I am also trying to raise money for all of the out of pocket medical expenses. Not only will the chemo treatments be expensive, but I am also trying to bank my eggs in a fertility center, so that I can have children in the future. My insurance will not cover these costs, but having a future family is really important to me, so I am asking for YOUR help!Many of you have asked me what you can do to help, and now I am asking you for your help with raising donations. I need to raise $15,000 by NEXT WEEK in order to start the procedure. The fertility procedure cannot be pushed back because every day that we wait to start chemo, the less effective it will be. So now I asking you to donate however much you can, and if you can’t donate please help me by spreading the word and sharing it on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, email, or texts. I’m going to keep fighting and now I need you on my team to help me fight this thing as well!",af5c5a492170b5220f9a574941548117,16,1.3659333333333334,600.0,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

For the first time in my life, my mom was bed-ridden every time I called her.

We still would need about $25,000 in order to have her go through this very time-sensitive urgent surgery (in the next couple of weeks).  The rest of the $40K is dedicated to the post-operational expenses and treatments like chemotherapy.  Detailed expenses will be listed as we continue paying for them.If you can, please help her get a chance to meet her soon-to-be-coming grandchild and spend many joyful years together. My family and I will be forever grateful. Note:I will be updating the fund needs and the medical progress as we go through this process.

After months of working and studying for the preliminary exam, he had 2 weeks to go before sitting for the final.On May 6th, we received a voicemail from an unknown number. It was Jack saying that he had been in a car accident (totaled his car) caused by a seizure while driving and was at the hospital. After the CT and MRI scans revealed a 7cm mass taking up about 50-60% of his frontal lobe, the Neurosurgery team from Tampa General decided to perform a biopsy on May 9th. The biopsy revealed the mass was a Stage 2 Malignant Glioma (Astrocytoma). The tumor in its current state is inoperable, but the hope is to shrink it with treatment, then remove it with a final brain surgery.The treatment plan includes several regimens of pills daily to control and prevent seizures, 6 weeks of daily radiation combined with daily oral chemotherapy. From there the plan is to have a Chemotherapy Port inserted into one of his main heart arteries and follow with a much stronger regimen of intravenous chemotherapy, combined with pill chemotherapy for the next 6-12 months depending on how treatment goes to shrink the tumor.Since his accident, his mother has relocated to Tampa and family routinely visits to support him. He has endured multiple hospital admissions and countless medical exams and we are just getting started. We have posted some photos, videos and audio as a timeline of events that will keep everyone updated on his recovery.The proceeds from this fund will be used mostly for medical bills as they can be quite expensive, but the hope is to create a foundation for cancer research once Jack beats his cancer.

This Go Fund Me is in support of my best friend, my soulmate, my partner in crime Rush. Here is our storyWednesday our world turned upside down. We woke up in the morning and said our ""I love yous and have a great day"" and went about our day. At 4 pm, Rush and I spoke on the phone and he told me that he wasn't feeling well and was going home. This, if you know Rush, is not normal. I headed home to meet him and found him shivering uncontrollably. As we were talking and he was telling me his symptoms, he started to have a seizure. It was intense, I called 911 and stayed on the phone while we waited for it to pass. After about a minute of checking his breathing and thinking the worst was over- a second seizure hit- this one just as intense as the first one. As the amazing team of help arrived, it took us what felt like a lifetime to be able to get him stable enough to take him to the hospital. As he regained consciousness, he was confused and unaware of what happened. In true Baba style- his entire family was there in a matter of minutes. What we heard next was unexpected... They had found a mass on his right side of the brain measuring 13mm in size- we were being transferred to the Med Center. We arrived at the Med Center, were treated with a fantastic staff that had already assembled the Neuro team and were ready to do further testing. We were admitted in to the Neurology ICU unit. It was all a whirlwind- really felt more like a crazy dream. The next day, the team came in and told us initial findings. Surgery was needed- we needed more imaging to map out the brain, and everything seemed like it was although bad news- it was the best case scenario for what we were dealing with. Friday we would meet with the best of the best that would actually be doing the procedures. What came next was the scariest thing that we could have heard. Friday we learned that it looks like we are fighting a big fight. Rush has what seems to be a stage 3 Glioblastoma. To put it in perspective- it is the most aggressive types of brain cancer that you can have. John McCain had it, and it is the second most common type of brain cancer that is out there. Most people that get this have a survival rate of 1-3 years. As I type this, I need a moment to let that sink in.Despite this, we have a few things to our advantage. He is healthy. He has minimal symptoms leading up to the seizures. He is under the age of 40. He is strong willed and strong physically. He is a fighter and has serious will power and mental strength. If you know his story- you know that this is all true. Because of all of this, we are asking for your help. We are ready to fight this. No matter what the outcome is- we are not going down without a fight. but we need your help. We don't know how much this is going to cost. We have had many friends offer to set this up for us, but we wanted to use this as an opportunity to tell our story. His story and his journey with this battle. I know in my heart that he is not a statistic. He is not the 1-3 year average. I know in my heart that God is not done with him yet- he has not fulfilled his purpose yet. We are asking for your kind donation to help us fight this cause- weather it is in financial help, in prayer, in small acts of kindness, in an uplifting word. Any help in any way is appreciated. We are humbling ourselves in knowing that in our weakest moments is when God does his best work.

One of BOCAG's major fundraisers for the year, is the Skydive day, which will be held on the weekend of 4th March, 2017.  (Oh goodness - help me......yikes) 


So I ask for you to help out and please give a donation to this amazing group of women who have been volunteering their time and raising funds on the Border to support and educate the women of our community on disease prevention of the insidieous silent killer.

My wife, our children’s mommy, Shelley Graf-Beardsley, got diagnosed with Small Cell Lung Cancer(SCLC) extensive.  It is a fast-growing cancer and can spread throughout the body very aggressively.  SCLC makes up only about 15% of people that have lung cancer.  They found it in her upper left lung lymph nodes and found it on two spots of her bone, one on T12 spine and her right hip bone.  She is currently undergoing chemo and possible radiation at Cancer Institute of Florida.  This is a very tough cancer to treat and there isn’t currently a cure for SCLC.  Shelley and I have been together for 20 years, and married 13 of those 20 years.  We have two wonderful sons that we love dearly.  Blake is our older son, he is 13 years old, and Zander is 7 years old.  They don’t like seeing their mommy sick, nor do I, it’s very difficult to see her like this and not being able to fix her.  Our family has been turned upside down with Shelley having this terrible disease.  Shelley is one of the toughest, strongest woman I know.  She is not used to being the patient, she is the one who takes care of patients.  She works for the State of Florida as a RN, who takes care of kids with disabilities.   She loves her job, but she even loves the rewards and satisfaction more, knowing she is helping and caring for these children to help better their lives. She has done so much helping others, now she’s the one that needs help.  It is very difficult for us to ask for help, we are usually the ones to help others in difficult situations.  We have both missed a lot of work, not paid time off, to take care of her medical issues she now faces.  Now medical bills are coming in, we have already gone through the savings we had to pay for some of the medical bills and medications.  We still have a long way to go.  This is a long fight to battle this nasty cancer.  If they can treat it, it is very possible it can come back very fast and even more aggressive.  Unless they come out with a magical cure, we could be battling this for the rest of her life.  Our biggest concern or worry, besides her getting healthy, is our two boys.  We want to make sure we can keep a roof over their heads and food on the table.  This is very difficult to even image, not able to provide for our boys.  One day our family is happy and spending and enjoying quality time together, and now we are constantly praying and hoping to keep our mommy alive and keep our family complete.",e7bc59ee15597df6221a4572bf78c41c,28,0.6675,660.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I was diagnosed with Stage II Breast Cancer at 26 and it recurred as Stage IV in my bones & lungs at 29. I am going into my 5th year living with stage IV and 8th year with Cancer. I want to say THANK YOU for everyone who has helped me emotionally, supported my side businesses, and my family & my fiance for always trying to help. Cancer has literally taken a toll on me financially - from significant medical debt, costs of treatments, and costs of hollistic care (which I truly believe have helped keep me healthy despite cancer). If you know me, I am usually one to not ask for help. I will trudge along and do it myself until the going gets rough. Now the going has gotten rough. I have always had 2 jobs, paid my bills, and was typically doing well financially.  I had to quit my second job about 2yrs ago. I couldn't handle a 60+hour work week. Then I went out on 9months of medical leave. I was doing ""OK"" financially, white knuckling it and doing so many odd jobs to make ends meet. Finally I went back to work in winter 2015 after taking a 7mo break from work, but was hit with an unexpected need for radiation. The radiation took a lot from me, I had 3 bone spots radiated with chemotherapy, and I was been left with relatively low fatigue and permanent acid reflux and digestive issues. I could not work 100%. I worked at 80%, just enough to pay all my bills at the minimum payments with no frills. Sadly due to more treatment progression, cancer in my brain, and treatment side effects I have officially left my job, I loved on 5/31/17. I am on LTD and SSD, but it honestly is 50% of what I used to make prior to 6/1/17. We also now have to pay for COBRA, which as everyone knows is expensive. Kyle has OBAMACARE and we cannot risk putting me on that with how the government has been trying to change the ACA. Now I am literally in the red. Most of my money goes into rent, our only car, and the payments of copays, vitamins, and medications.  I still am unable to pay for my copays and vitamins sometimes and the bills rack up. Those methods previously mentioned are what brings me to this GoFundMe. All in hopes that someone - somewhere - can help me maintain residually optimum health and not have to strain myself physically and mentally by looking for another job. I am currently unable to work to debiliating fatigue and onset of recent Brain Tumor in November 2015 & a 40day stay in the ICU in September 2017 due to immunotherapy s/e and lung progression. Most of my money goes into my daily my bills, medical bills, and naturopathic treatments (which are costly), and with whatever income my husband pulls through. He has had to take less work to be my 24/hr caretaker many times & was out of work Jan 2017-April 2017 & has been out of work since July 2017 to the present to be my 24/7 Caretaker, he does not get FMLA as he is a freelancer & has been collecting unemployment from NY State.I do not qualify for Medicaid. Kyle is on Obamacare, which does not cover doctors outside of NJ & all my providers are in NYC. I cannot afford to risk my life and change oncologists because of health insurance issues. We will be paying close to 1,400 in Cobra a month to pay for my treatment, to keep me alive... yep, that seriously is like 2 weeks worth of pay for some people.I do get SSD and LTD, but it only covers the Cobra Insurance, my portion of the rent and some of my medical costs. The rest of my bills go in this pile I call ""figure it out another day"" and thats about it. Kyle also is not loaded with cash, so he unfortunately cannot pay all of these bills and debts for me. He had to drain his savings to stay afloat when he did not work Jan 2017 - April 2017 to care for me at home & then re-drained it again from July 2017 - present. My savings account is also on the verge of hitting 0 as of 2018. The funds from the GoFundMe have run out. I have used the money to pay medical debt, bills, food to stay alive, and copays to my doctors for treatment. Thank you all for the encouragement and standing alongside me in my healing journey! I truly believe this is NOT what is in the cards for me, but I do the best I can. THANK YOU ALL for taking time to read this.HX OF CARE:9/30/10 - ER/PR+ HER2- Stage 2 Metastatic Breast @ 26 yrs old EARLY STAGE TREATMENTS: Bilateral Mastectomy with 2 Reconstructive Surgeries16 Sessions of Chemotherapy - Adriamycin & Cytoxan x4 and 12 sessions of weekly Taxol28 Sessions of Radiation to Clavicle, chest wall and breast skin2 years on Tamoxifen6yrs of Lymphedema Treatment for Left ArmMETASTATIC DISEASE TREATMENTSAREAS WITH METASTATIC DISEASE 7/28/13 - ER/PR+ HER2- Stage 4 w/ metastasis to: Left Pleural Lining of Left Lung - 2013Left Hip Illiac Joint - 2014Spine : T3-T7, T11, L1-L3, Sacrum - 2014 & 2015Sternum - 2016Small Spots on Liver Surface - 2015 & 2017Both Ovaries - 2015Brain - 2016Perionetium - 2015 & 2017TREATMENTS THUS FAR: and OUTCOME:Radiation TherapiesApril 2015 & April 2016 Radiation to ever bone metastis region within the last 12mo - stayed clear of cancer, but left with deformed bones, low WBC and muscular painDecember 2016 Radiation to my brain - 9 spots of the 11 they found: left me with hair loss, fatigue and word recall issuesMore Brain Radiation - April 2017 - radiation to the leftover 2 spots from December 2016 & 2 new spots with more hair loss!! yayJuly 2017 - More brain radiation to another spot with targeted radiation.

For those of you that know him, you know that Izzy is an extraordinary human being. He is always cheerful and making jokes, brings life to any room he enters, and most of all he is selfless. That is the reason I am writing this.Luckily, he was able to catch the cancer at an earlier stage. It all started as what was thought to be a simple toothache. For the past 2 months, Izzy has been to countless dentists, doctors, and surgeons all while trying to balance this with his work and normal life. Izzy owns and operates his own small business, a driving school, and has an adorable daughter and incredible wife.In the last week, he received news of what is to come. He will need to have surgery to remove the cancer from his jaw. This surgery is very intensive (14 hours and 30+ doctors) and will require removing his molars and lymph nodes and cutting out the right half of his jaw down to the base. Then his jaw will be reconstructed using a bone from his leg. Needless to say, Izzy has a tough road ahead as he will need to learn to eat and speak with his new jaw and to walk without part of the bone in his leg. If anyone can do it, it is our stubborn-as-a-mule Izzy! After rehab is complete, he still has several months of radiation and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells. Because of all this, Izzy will be unable to work for several months and his medical expenses have yet to be covered. So far, the process has taken two months and his rehab will be up to six months. The surgery is needed as soon as possible to relieve Izzy of the intense pain and to prevent the cancer from spreading. Izzy already had to take off a lot of time from work due to the pain and has had to pay several thousand dollars out-of-pocket just for scans and testing. He has received word that if he does not start the entire process over down in Richmond, VA the cost of the lengthy surgery, rehab, and couple months of chemo will continue to come out-of-pocket. With these medical expenses and the necessities of everyday life on top of raising his beautiful daughter, being an amazing husband and son, and running his own business, money will be getting tighter and tighter.Izzy is one of the strongest, most determined, and selfless people I have ever come across. There is no end to Izzy lending his hand, his ear, or his heart to each and every one of us in any time of need. This gets said about people quite often, but I am not just saying it. I have literally seen this man give someone the shirt off his back. I am extremely proud to consider him a best friend…a brother.Now, I ask you to send back some of that love and support Izzy’s way. Anything you can donate will be extremely and truly appreciated. Surrounding Izzy with love and support is what is most important. Positive energy and prayers will help Izzy completely kick cancer’s ass! I have no doubt, and neither does he, that he will come back from this stronger than ever. Please spread the word and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts!WE GOT THIS!!!",9eb3fb15f98c6605ae16cb8e1f784cc0,29,0.24657333333333334,30.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

We always were told to not talk about ourselves and our problems outside of the home, because ""everyone has their own problems to deal with,"" and ""there's always someone else who has had it worse,"" and ""we've been blessed in so many ways"", and ""it's important to remain and look strong"". Yes, while all of these things may be true, sometimes it's okay to let others in. Sometimes it's necessary. Sometimes, when you think your family has been through enough bad to last a lifetime, you feel so blindsided that you need to reach out and ask for help, and share your story, or you'll drown. On Friday, March 23, 2018, after my 29 year old twin brother told me that he was diagnosed with cancer, I knew that now was the time for me to finally share our family's story and reach out for help. Now, more than ever, we need the help of others to remain strong through this time, as my brother battles cancer, and as I watch yet another person whom I love go through this fight. This page is for my brother while he battles cancer. But in order to fully understand who we are, who he is, I want to tell our whole story, from the beginning. Since I’m terrible at dealing with emotional issues when speaking to others, and even worse at opening up enough to appear vulnerable or weak, writing is the only and best way that I know how to tell the most raw, honest story of our lives, from my eyes, anyway. Only after I pour my heart out onto this webpage can I humbly ask for everyone’s help during this difficult time, because we need kindness and support to help us endure this battle, once again.  So here I go.The profile picture on this website shows my twin brother, Bill, and I on Christmas morning, 2011. My brother and I have witnessed so much illness and death for our age, in my opinion, but this two-minute-older dude and I have preserved and have had each other’s backs during the hardest times.. and although you'd think I'd have learned better by now, I never once imagined that the person with whom I shared my mother’s womb may also fall victim to, and be forced to stand up against my #1 enemy, whom I shall name here for theatrical literary purposes, The Cancer Villain. This Villain first invited himself into our home when my brother and I were four years old, and it has taunted us continually with each passing year since then. On July 15, 1993, the day after her 41st birthday, our mother was diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, and was given a 50% chance to live. For three months following that, she lived in Columbus, Ohio, going through chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, fighting to survive. We were not allowed to see her other than through her window, because kids just generally carry more germs than adults, and her immune system was too low to risk being in close proximity of us. I don't remember much since we were so young at the time, but I do remember standing outside of the Columbus hospital, looking up at the hospital room window and being told to wave hello to her. Our older sister, at age 15, was forced to step into the role of the mother of two very confused and upset kids. She was too young to have to grow up so soon, but she did anyway, and she took on the responsibility beautifully, with the help of many supportive family members and friends. We were lucky to have such a strong and loving sister with us during that scary time. In the end and by some miracle, our mother survived, and was finally able to come home, but the road to recovery was not quick or fun for her, as she was forced to remain isolated from us for three more long months, where she resided next door at my grandmother's house, waving to us from her bedroom window. She told me a few years back that for a very long time, I was afraid of her and wouldn't say hi to her, because I didn’t recognize this bald stranger trying to comfort me. I cannot imagine how awful that must have been for her. After spending two more years in recovery mode, she was finally allowed to go back to work. She remained in remission for years and life was mostly back to normal for us. Then, nine years after her first diagnosis, in 2002, the Villain came knocking on our family’s door once more, and with it he brought back her Leukemia. Because of her age and her body already having endured the harshness of chemotherapy before, it was decided that chemo a second time may end up killing her before the cancer could, and so she was put on a medication, called Gleevec, that keeps her white blood cell count under control, but does not ever rid her body of the cancer that has already manifested inside of her. To present day today, she lives each day with Leukemia, but you would never be able to tell if you saw her. She lives life to the fullest and looks healthy, on the outside, at least. It has been a little over 15 years now, and her body continues to accept the drugs. While this is amazing news, the thought and terror associated with the idea that one day her body will become immune to the drug and she will have to start a new regimen and hope that it is successful in keeping the cancer at bay is constantly in the back of our minds.. like a ticking time bomb, we all are waiting at a standstill, not knowing when the timer will go off... but until then, we live life in the moment and appreciate the time that we have together. She truly is the strongest person I know. And the Villain remained in the background, planting his feet in our home, while we went on with our lives, trying to forget about him, the best that we could.As if worrying about our mother for most of our lives wasn't bad enough, our unwanted and unwelcome Villain decided that he didn't want to remain in the background any longer, and so he chose another member of our family to target, and this time it was our dad, which took us all by total and utter surprise. This news came to us in summer of 2014, when my dad complained of a stomachache one day and brushed it off, thinking it was gall stones again, a problem he struggled with from time to time throughout the years. None of us even questioned it, because it made perfect sense. So he scheduled a doctors appointment for what he thought was stones, only to find out one September afternoon that he had Stage 4 cancer in the stomach region, but with no way of knowing the origin of the cancer since it had already spread throughout his entire abdominal area. My own Daddy, the very same man whom I’ve never even known to have a cold before, was dying, and it was all happening out of the blue and very quickly. When you are used to worrying about one ill parent your entire life, you forget to even consider the idea that something bad could also happen to the other. We were all in total shock. My dad especially. He thought he was going to live forever. He used to joke about it, except I guess I sort of actually believed him, because there was just no way the Villain would come for both parents... it was just absurd to even think such a horrible thought! Going through my dad’s battle with cancer was when I finally came to realize that it’s not the actual devastation that rips your heart into pieces, it’s the hope that we all blindly and ignorantly cling onto, even when we all know what’s coming in the end, but no one wants to say it out loud. We just wanted to believe that maybe, by another miracle, he would just one day wake up better or his cancer would start reversing and one day he'd be completely healed. The masochistic games our minds play on us when we just don't want to handle the truth are truly impressive. Even when I thought I was mentally ready for the end to come, I learned that you can genuinely never prepare for the loss of a loved one.. and my dad was, and still is, my world. My brother and I had more amazing adventures with him than most people have in a lifetime with their parents, and for that I am deeply grateful, but it doesn’t take away or even lessen the pain and sadness I still feel 3.5 years after his passing. After only a short 10 weeks of being diagnosed, on November 22nd, 2014, our father passed away in the middle of the night, just moments after my mom decided to finally shut her eyes to rest for a minute or two in my dad’s hospital room. He waited for her to fall asleep, and then he left us, not wanting any of us to have to watch him go, protecting us until his last minute of life on this earth. Typical Dad move. I will never forget that morning and the phone call I received from my mother, or how cold it was that day, snowing and icy and miserable. After the call, I remember running outside and sitting down in the freezing cold snow. I still don’t know if I became numb from the weather or from the inside out, but probably both. I was the one who made the call to my sweet, loving brother. He wouldn’t even answer the phone for so long, because he knew there was only one reason I'd be calling so early, and he wasn’t ready to hear it. It was the saddest day of my life so far, and that sadness remains just as strong now as it did on that day. My brother and my dad were best friends and did everything together. While I was his little baby princess, those two were two peas in a pod. My heart broke most for Bill on that sad, awful day that changed our lives and hearts forever. On that day, the Villain moved back into the background, and allowed us some time to grieve.With all bad comes some good, as that is the natural order of things. Before our dad passed away, we were introduced to our older half brother, Dan, who we never knew we had. In the last weeks of his life, Dan and my dad bonded as they should have for the last 43 years of Dan's life. It’s unfortunate that certain situations don’t always happen the way that you think they should, but my dad's death brought Dan's family into our lives, and if there was any small blessing hidden within that tragic event, it was this. Even though he was not raised by my dad, it is crazy to watch Dan as he mimics mannerisms of our father without even knowing that he's doing it. It truly is crazy how that all works. I am so happy to have him and his family in our lives now, as he has helped carry on and strengthen our father's memory, even in times when things were looking very dark and bleak for me. I will be forever grateful of this.As the years went by, we all adapted to life without our dad. Not a day goes by that I don't miss him, and it never ""gets better"" as the years pass, as so many people used to tell me. Time does not actually heal all wounds, but rather, you just become better at dealing with the pain. And though I'll never agree, our Villain decided that enough time had passed to emerge front and center back into our lives and demand attention once more. This time, my twin brother became the target.On March 23, my brother told me that he was diagnosed with cancer. Early prognosis was Hodgkin's Lymphoma, which has a very good survival rate, and so even though this was devastating news for my family, everyone seemed hopeful that this cancer would be cured and over with quickly and easily. Me, being the dark and dreary one, saw the familiar glimmer of hope in everyones’ voices and silently waited for the other shoe to drop. This drop occurred when we received Bill's final results. While he does, in fact, have Hodgkin's Lymphoma, he also has non-Hodgkin's Large B-cell Lymphoma, as well. Who knew you could have two different types at one time? I don't know why I continue to be surprised by this kind of news, but I do. This news came to him on Friday, April 6th, and on Tuesday, April 10th, they will put a port into his chest and then begin the first of multiple, aggressive rounds of 144-hour long chemotherapy the following day (04/11/18). He will then get 15 days of rest and recuperation, then the next 144-hour chemo will begin. During this time, all that we can do is wait and hope and pray, and then hope and wait and pray some more.Here is what I want to come from me telling our story: During this time, I want Bill to focus on nothing but fighting this cancer. During this time, I don't want him to stress about the hospital bills piling up, or about the normal, everyday bills piling up, or about whether or not he will have a job after all of this, or about ANYTHING AT ALL. I want him to focus on getting better and staying postive through this crappy hand of cards he's been dealt. So this is why I've started this GoFundMe page as he begins his first round of chemo. It is my hope and goal that after this first 144 hours of what I can only imagine to be a traumatic, terrifying and lonely experience, I can surprise my brother and ease a bit of his stress by showing him this website and showing him cold, hard cash donated to him to help him afford bills and daily living expenses while he conquers this Villain! My hope is that through this page and the donations coming in to support him, he will see all of the people that are there for him and for our family, and that will give him the extra boost of courage and strength that he may at some point need during this battle to want to continue on. Do you think you can help me with that? Anything, no matter the amount, I believe will truly help, and will also touch all of my family’s hearts forever. In addition, I know that it will help Bill stay positive as he views this page and all of the donations from all of you amazing supporters. I know that he will be touched deeply by the goodness of people that want to help and support him. I plan to withdraw the funds and help him figure out bills while I am with him during his second round of chemo, and then I’d like to start paying whatever billers he decides need paid off, from highest priority to least priority. That way, he will just be able to focus on healing, while my mom and I pay his bills with the help of your donations, and it is my hope that when he completes his final round of chemo he will not have to worry about mass amounts of bills that are either past due or due ASAP. I think that he will truly benefit enormously from your donations and my family’s efforts to deal with the billers now so that he won’t have to later. Please show your support for my brother during this difficult time, and help him fight through this battle against our longtime enemy, so we can put this Villain back into the shadows for good, where he belongs.My love and sincerest gratitude goes out to all of those who are reading this,Sincerely,Katie EggerHere some more photos of us if you still feel like scrolling :)￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼",a8b5b17d42c0d255f3d54b0a3053b670,94,0.867,270.0,5,1,0,12,0,5,0,0.004235792446170138,0.0,0.06536572052401747,24.38211515675854,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

I love her. Everyone loves her. My brother, my dad, her church, people she does not even know all love her. Even though her English is not that great, she is able to speak so much kindness with her hands, her smile, her love and her amazing cooking. So it breaks my heart to say that she is battling stomach cancer. To get up to date, please see my facebook posts first here, then here and finally here . Currently, she is at Samsung Hospital, South Korea after a successful surgery that removed the cancer (along with 2/3 of her stomach). The recovery has been painful but she is MAMA HWANG (and doing very well). However, the cancer has advanced locally to her lymph nodes. My dad, who has been by her side constantly with very little rest and a husband's heart that has encouraged us all, will be meeting with the doctors this coming Thursday (6/30) or Friday (7/1) to dicuss chemotherapy in Korea as that is what my mother wants to do. This GoFundMe is primarily in response to the overwhelming words and outpouring from my friends and facebook community. Since we decided to forego the US health care system, all of my mother's hospital bills are out-of-pocket. Her admission to Samsung Hospital, all the scans, her successfull surgery and her current recovery will cost $13,000. My brother, my dad and myself are doing all that we can (with the amazing help of her church, LA United Church) but we hope that you can help us. There has already been so much support - emotionally, spiritually and financially. My mom has truly made her mark on so many people's lives. It is tough to hear but it is really times like these that remind us of the people we do have in our lives and to cherish every moment, every breath. I really hope that for her next birthday, there will be as many of you as possible with my brother Paul helping her blow out the candles. with love, Alex, Paul and Michael Hwang",620876fa15add85bc6d81f4ceef4b449,20,1.618153846153846,930.0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

First I was scared out of my mind; sometimes being an informed OR nurse is too much information. But as all mom’s do I got busy focusing on “how to fix this”. So I started the seemingly impossible task of gathering data about the Surgeon in Indiana that’s going to do the miracle working and putting the tools together to help him make a treatment plan. As I went from Hospitals to doctors’ offices to labs and finally to the post office to accomplish this I came across many angels among us. People went out of their way to help me, cried with me and prayed for us. Then our family began to get the news and like a true army getting ready for battle everyone began to offer their time, effort, prayers, and support. So Will and I are on our way to Indiana. We left with last minute paperwork from the Surgeon, a cooler of road trip treats and some extra $$ to help fund the trip; all from the rallying troops. I can never express to you all how thankful and grateful we are to have such a strong army of family fighting with us. Every text, call, and prayer reminds me of our love for each other and that God is truly carrying us through this time with all of you as His angels. My truly special Aunts also sent a bottle of holy water from the Shrine of St. Joseph’s where miracles have been documented. How could we not beat this with support like that! My heart is overflowing!""William is currently on his way to Indiana to a cancer surgeon specialist to remove 2 lymph masses attached to potentially dangerous arteries/ veins.  As Theresa said, this will be a miracle surgery (Surgery date scheduled for 12/8/17) but with everyone's prayers and love; we hope God and all the people involved will heal William. He needs our support now more than ever. William will have to stay in Indiana for an extended period of time while he heals from the surgery  and attends numerous doctors visits. So all prayers, all love and all donations are so greatly appreciated during this time! Let's rally around William and beat cancer once and for all!! (Original Post Below)___________________________________________________________This campaign is for someone very special and I don’t say that because of who he is to me but because it’s the truth. Since day one, William has been a fighter. In his own words from a college essay he wrote, “I was born with an obstruction by the name of cleft lip cleft palate. When in the womb everyone has a cleft lip and palate, but more often than not the tissues of the upper mouth and lip convene in the middle and fuse. This meeting place is marked by a scar that everyone carries right beneath their nose and in the top of their mouth. In my case this normality was not to be.”  William had to be stronger than the rest due to the cards he was dealt in life.  But I must say that what we go through in life defines who we are, which is no different in William’s case.  In that same essay, William described coming to a conclusion at a very young age, “This is who I am and no matter what anyone thinks I will never change.”  He has since lived his life with a purpose that is hard to encapsulate with words.  William loves harder than most because he has known the feeling of being alone, he works harder than most because life was not given to him easily, he does not strive for everyone’s approval because in his heart he knows those that truly matter, he knows how to be supportive because of the support given to him by friends and family, he is more compassionate than most because he has unconditional acceptance for those who need it, endurance in life that is unwavering, and the courage to love with no bounds. Simply put, William is special and that will never change.Now at 26 almost 27 years old, William has been dealt another card.  He has recently been diagnosed with Testicular Cancer.  The fighter that has fought all his life, must fight again.  William will no doubt have a long and hard road ahead of him.  He will need all the support from friends and family he can get.  William and his family would greatly appreciate any and all donations to help alleviate the financial stress during this time.  All donations will help William focus on fighting this battle and becoming healthy once again.  With gratitude that can’t be measured, we thank each and every one who donates as well as those who help support William’s campaign against cancer.  After all, Fighting Cancer Takes Balls.  p.s.- William has crowned himself the #oneballwonder. For more information on Testicular Cancer and how you can Self Screen, please visit the sites below:  http://www.testicularcancersociety.org/testicular-self-exam.html  https://www.cancer.org/cancer/testicular-cancer/do-i-have-testicular-cancer.html",4b685263d63eadf36cc050a0c5c640b5,40,0.4545,660.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Keegan is 23 years old, is a long term member of Northside Baptist Church in Weatherford, and when he isn't working Keegan spends his time helping others. If you know Keegan,  you know two things: (1) he's going to offer you a cup of tea &  (2) if you're in need he's there to help in anyway that he can. Keegan has a servants heart and that is what led him to finding out the news about his Kidney. Keegan had it on his heart to donate one of his kidneys to someone in need, when he went to the doctor to get tested to donate is when he found out he has had cancer for a year. Keegan still hasn't had surgery to remove his Kidney because he does not have health insurance. He has spent the past month researching and trying to get insurance but still hasn't been able to get it. After the surgery Keegan will be in recovery up to 3 months, and unable to work. I have made this fundraiser for Keegan's surgery, hospital stay, food, and bills. I hope that the community that Keegan has spent half his life serving will return the favor and serve him. I ask you all to be in prayer for healing, and for God's hand to be on this whole process. I will keep you all updated!

Because she was only 40, it was recommended that she have a double mastectomy to prevent the cancer from coming back in the other breast later on in life.  In addition, all of the lymph nodes were removed from her left side. After surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, reconstructive surgery, and two additional surgeries due to complications with the radiated tissue during the healing process, we were finally past this physical/mental/emotional battle. Her cancer had been Triple positive: positive for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2. Hormone therapy treatments can help prevent a return of the disease so she has been on a medication called tamoxifen which helps stop cancer from coming back by blocking hormone receptors. However, we've recently found that she has now developed cancer in several bones and also in her liver, derived from the original cancer and also triple positive. And so our journey begins all over again. But this time, the financial commitment is much greater. She will be taking an aromatase inhibitor to actually stop estrogen production and force her body into menopause. Update: medications have changed. “Ibrance” has not been FDA approved for mom’s type of cancer. Starting intravenous therapy and eventually surgery will take place to remove her ovaries and further reduce hormone-responsive growth.Any amount in donation helps.

 Thankfully, he is now surviving and thriving and shows no evidence of growth or spread of the Cancer, as of his last tests in March 2016.  On the heels of the fight for his son's life against Cancer, Gioi has learned that he, too has Cancer.   

Gioi was diagnosed at the tender age of 37 with Advanced Stage T3 Prostate Cancer.   The staging has been updated after his Radical Prostatectomy Surgery revealed Lymph involvement.  Now it is considered advanced Stage 4 Prostate Cancer.   We have options for treatment at this point, none of them easy, but he is confident and prepared to beat this thing!  The help and support of family and friends is so appreciated and necessary.As of November 2, 2016, Maggie is also fighting her own Cancer. Stage 4 Colon Cancer that has metastasized to the liver.  Our little family is literally in the fight of our lives.  Maggie's proposed treatment begins with 4 rounds of Chemotherapy, hoping to shrink the liver tumors enough to be removed with sugery, the original Colon tumor will also be removed and the Colon rejoined, hopefully without need for a permanent Colostomy bag.  Currently the Colon tumor is being pushed out of the way with a Stent to make eating and passing stool possible for her. We will post updates as we have them on Caring Bridge: www.caringbridge.org/visit/gioigraziano

 Gioi is a caring father, loving husband, cherished son and brother, and just the nicest guy you could ever meet.  It is so unfair that he has been stricken with this disease, after fighting it so long second hand with our son.  Not that anyone deserves to be sick, but he is the last person who deserves this!  

Send Get-Well cards, if desired to: Gioi Graziano and/or Maggie Graziano  P.O. BOX 2352  CARLSBAD, CA 92018

I am personally devastated and reeling, but I also know we have the strenth to fight, because we have been fighting Cancer for over half our marriage!  I wouldn't trade a minute of it for anything, though.   Maybe the fight has made us stronger, it certainly hasn't broken us!  All I ask is maybe 60 more years with the man of my dreams, my soulmate, the amazing father of my amazing sons!As we struggle to keep up with our childrens' hospital bills, these new diagnoses weigh heavily on our minds for financial reasons as well.  Gioi has continued working, through pain and discomfort, to provide for his wife, son and baby.  We hate to ask for anything, and never wanted to fundraise during our son's fight, but understand we need help with this now.

I have created reward levels, but please donate in any amount.  You have our sincerest thanks and appreciation,



A Message from Gioi's Mom:

It is so difficult when a family struggles with Cancer, but no family should be fighting two battles at once. My grandson was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma at the age of 9 months and has gone through chemo, surgeries and too many tests to tally. He is six and is a survivor, our Super Hero. My son and his wife are the most amazing couple. Their combined strength and resilience is beyond belief. But there is a new battle on the horizon for my sweet family. My son, at the age of 37, has just been diagnosed with Stage 3 Prostate Cancer. He is so concerned for his family and their well-being. He has always put family above his personal needs and desires.

As you can see in the above x-ray, the dark circle is the tumor. Kelsey went through 6 doctors this past October who told her ""it was just lower back muscle pain."" Finally, Kelsey took herself to the Mayo Clinic without a referral. She knew her body best, and she knew that those 6 doctors were wrong. After several trips to get tests done (CT scans, MRI, blood, urine, etc.)  Kelsey holds a positive ""glass half full"" attitude that lights up the room. She was told many times by Mayo Clinic staff, ""You are one of the bravest I've seen in a while. You have such a good attitude."" Many co-workers said, ""How are you even functioning knowing that you have cancer?"" Kelsey holds the belief that negative thinking only brings about even more negativity. She truly believes that your mind controls healing and how your body responds. Therefore, she was laughing all the way up until they put the mask on her to go to sleep. She had the nurses in the operation room laughing because she kept the mood light. The anesthesiologist said, ""I love talking with you and could talk to you all day, you are such a bright person. It's too bad you have to go to sleep."" Kelsey has had 6 CT scans in the past 4 months. She has had one MRI, numerous amounts of blood work, 3 ultrasounds, urine tests, and has also undergone robotic surgery. These have all added up to cost over $7,000 out of pocket. Any support or help that you can provide would be much appreciated. Kelsey's surgery was successful. That is all thanks to her intuition telling her that those 6 doctors were wrong before bringing herself to Mayo. She is recovering well and is still holding her positive attitude. However, her financial debt from this journey has weighed her down. Please help continue the positive outcome.

Many of you are friends and family and know her but some of you have know idea who she is or much about what her recent diagnosis is .Elizabeth has 2 beautiful babies, Elijah Grey (Age 9) and Elana Rose (Age 3). Elizabeth is only 31 years old. She lost her Medical Coding job, the sole support for her family, in October 2018. She immediately became very ill with one thing after another which made it extremely challenging to look for, much less, find work. It’s important for me to tell you how this all came about because at the end of the day, its going to help somebody, somewhere at sometime. So how did we get from a lump felt for the first time a few days before December 17th to starting 5 months of Chemo on January 13, 2019? On December 17th, Elizabeth sent me a text about the lump she just felt..... I was there later that day and felt it …… literally FELT it. It was a lump, 1 o’clock position of right breast and I remember saying, “Yeah you need a Mamo”… We have NO family history of Cancer. Our family genetics are Heart Disease. So although the size alarmed me, having no history of cancer and the fact that Elizabeth has breastfed continuously for 9 years, the likelihood of breast cancer was minimal… at least that’s what I kept telling myself. You may or may not know that breastfeeding is supposed to be one way to keep breast cancer out of the picture!Elizabeth has had Celiac Disease for 15 years and statistics show that this disease is usually followed by other autoimmune diseases if you don’t take care of yourself. Wednesday afternoon, December 19th, we went to a walk-in clinic in so we could get an order for a Mammogram and ultrasound. Just like that … boom, boom, boom! Mammogram, Ultrasound, Biopsy in a matter of days one after another. It appeared with the rapid scheduling of events that the Doctors thought speed was of importance. Monday, January 7th at 8:55am, as I was pulling in to take Elana, my 3-year-old Grandbaby to gymnastics, I got a text from Elizabeth, “Call me asap” and I knew!She got the call … “Its cancer and we want to get you in today to go over everything and get your treatment plan started…. are you available at 1:00 P.M TODAY?” Here’s what they found:A. Large lump … Triple Negative Invasive Mammary Carcinoma. B. Small lump…. Estrogen and Progesterone Fed Invasive Mammary Carcinoma C. Lymphnode biopsy showed small amount of tumor cells.The amazing Nurse already had our appointments scheduled for us as they slipped Elizabeth into scheduling spots immediately for:1. Surgeon2. Oncologist3. MRI4. Genetic testing5. Port Insertion for Chemotherapy.6. CT Scan - Added by Oncologist during that appointment7. Echocardiogram - Added by Oncologist during that appointment. Thursday, January 17, the first of 5 months of Chemo began. Once chemo is complete, she will have a double mastectomy and will not be able to work while she is being treated. Elizabeth and the kids have moved in with us so we can care for everyone while she is going through her treatment. Elizabeth has government insurance which is a blessing but that is all we have in order to support her through this. This fundraiser is to help with the following:1. The extensive supplemental treatments 2. Alternative therapies that will only be possible with the support of others3. Acupuncture4. Massage5. Biomat6. Enemas 7. Wig for when her hair falls out in a couple weeks. She just recently cut her hair off and was going to donate it to a child with cancer but hadn’t gotten around to sending it in yet. She will be able to have her own hair made into a wig with your support.8. Juicer to support the fresh juices she will be drinking daily9. Raw and Fresh foods to support her new dietary restrictions10. Everyday expenses like her car payment and insurance, the 2 months remaining on her lease at the apartment and electric bill.11. Gymnastics for the kids – We hate to take them out of that since it’s something they love and thrive with. They are feeling the stress of what is happening and I feel like they need that as an outlet 12. Sergei and I are and will continue to do all we possibly can to support her emotionally, physically and financially but we do, unfortunately, have limited funds and want to be able to give her the best possible chance of beating this. We have constantly been asked what everyone can do to help.I made this page to let everyone who wants to help know this is the best way to help us at this time.If you feel lead to help please know I will be in control of how every penny is spent.Our Family and Friends are big and strong and mighty and I know not everyone will be able to contribute monetarily and that’s fine.

After falling from a horse in September and breaking his ribs, the diagnosis took just four hours: Paul had cancer.The cancer, 'multiple myeloma', had been quietly attacking Paul's bones, immune system, kidneys, and red blood cell count. Chemotherapy started one week later at Central Peninsula Hospital. The weekly treatments will continue for approximately four months. Paul's body is responding unusually well to chemo, allowing him to take an entire month of treatment without the usual week-long break and continue working.The next step in beating this disease is for Paul to receive a stem cell bone marrow transplant, using his own cells. This has to be done at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance in February/March 2018. Paul is using his own cells to avoid the risk of donor rejection.And here is the heart of the matter folks:While Paul is currently working, and has health insurance, the insurance only covers direct treatment costs (with a copay), and none of the necessary travel or living expenses. Friends and family have asked how they can help cover those additional expenses for Paul and his daughter, Kristin, as they travel to Seattle for the transplant, which will require them both to live in quarantine for approximately eight weeks.After the transplant, there will be follow-up treatments in both Seattle and Soldotna.To focus on beating this cancer, Paul won't be racing the 2018 Iditarod.

She had been experiencing severe pain in her lower back since November, but she initially attributed the pain to overdoing it at her longstanding job as a hair stylist or falling while walking her dog. As the pain worsened and began to interfere with her ability to stand/walk comfortably, Nancy tried to remedy the issue with a chiropractor, seeing her family doctor and more. She did an X-ray and a CT scan while waiting to do a MRI. By then back pain, along with other symptoms, forced her to stop working. When Nancy finally received the MRI it revealed that she has stage 4 kidney cancer the has spread to her spine and liver.  She has compression fractures in her lower back and a larger tumor in the middle of her back which is moving her spine over.The treatment plan at the moment is to bring the cancer under control and to give her some relief. Nancy has undergone radiation treatments designed to reduce her back pain and to stop the growth of the tumors and hopefully reduce it size. She also just received approval to start immunotherapy. Throughout this ordeal, Nancy has shown remarkable strength and resilience. Certainly there have been tears, but she has been far more concerned with how this news is affecting her family and friends than she has been with herself. She has an upbeat positive attitude and is determined to fight the cancer with everything she has. Her youthful spirit, and deep compassion for others remain on full display all the time and she is still as fun as ever to be around. She isn’t going to let cancer take away her joy and is determined not to allow it to define her life. She has too much she wants to do, too many people to see, and too much love to give. With a positive mindset and the extraordinary support she is receiving from her family and some truly exceptional friends in her corner she has a great deal of hope for what is possible in her future. One of the hardest parts of this situation for Nancy has been asking for help. Nancy’s entire adult life has been marked by giving help and comfort to others. She has often dropped everything to listen to a friend or a customer who was in need. She’s the kind of person you can call in the middle of the night and she would be there in a second to help you. She has been a shoulder to cry on and a wise giver of advice and encouragement. She has done all of this without bringing attention to herself, and with no expectation of anything in return.Nancy was reluctant to allow us to create this GoFundMe site for her, but we don’t want her cancer to be financially devastating. All of the funds will help to cover her basic needs. One practical way we can all support her in this difficult time is to ease her financial burden. Except for the small processing fee charged by GoFundMe, 100% of donations made to this site will go for Nancy’s living expenses and medical needs.

I suffered through the rest of the weekend trying to control the pain with ibuprofen and ice packs.  By Monday I was desperate for relief from the pain...I called my daughter and she came to take me to Urgent Care.  There wasn't much they could do for me without escalating the visit to an ER visit, which would 10x to 20x the cost of the visit, and with no insurance, I needed to spend my modest savings wisely.  They did a minimal exam, prescribed some pain meds and strongly suggested I see a GYN doc as soon as possible.The next day I called a GYN and scheduled an appointment for the following day.  At the appointment, the GYN did a pelvic exam and collected some tissue for biopsy.   When the doctor called me on Sunday...I knew it wasn't good news...  (I was eerily calm...I think I was in shock...  I'm not afraid to die, but I'm in no hurry to do so.   I have a lot of living still to do, places to go, things to see, people to meet, lives to touch...wonderful children to spend time with, great friends...and an amazing precious granddaughter to watch her grow into a loving, compassionate, intelligent woman who will change the world...)She recommended I see a specialist asap.  The next morning I was on the phone calling a specialist and scheduled an appointment for that afternoon.  Three days later I underwent major surgery (radical full hysterectomy).  Because I had no insurance, the hospital required that I pay 50% of THEIR estimated costs up front, and sign a promissory note to pay the balance within 6 months.  That was half of my meager savings...  And that didn't include the anesthesiologist, surgeon, lab work etc...   At the post op appointment the next week...  I learned my uterus was the size of a cantaloupe when he removed it.  AND it was filled with aggressive stage 3 endometrial cancer which had started to grow through the wall of the uterus.  Yikes!!Now I'm facing chemo, radiation and more chemo every 3 weeks for the next 5 months.  Fortunately I was able to get insurance in place for 2019, which will help with most of those expenses but does nothing for the original medical expenses incurred in Nov/Dec 2018.The bills for the surgery are starting to come in and they are higher than I had expected....far beyond what I can pay on my own, especially since I'm not able to work at full speed right now...  After much encouragement from my friends...I'm swallowing my pride to ask for financial help.  No amount is too small, every amount is deeply appreciated, and anything will help...With gratitude...KarenLet's kick cancer out!!p.s.

This is a form of aggressive cancer in its late stages in his abdomen. While Lucas is grateful to have a strong emotional support system, advanced life saving cancer treatment comes with serious financial concerns and unexpected expenses that the family would like to be prepared for. Our final goal is to raise $65,000 to support Lucas and his family during this difficult time. However, in order to QUICKLY get support to them and reduce their stress and concern in these first weeks we are praying a need of $40,000 can be raised as soon as possible.Any contribution is greatly appreciated! Background: Lucas and his wife Kristen were celebrating a sweet friends wedding this past weekend when he noticed a lump in his abdomen. Both being in the medical field they quickly met with doctors earlier this week to determine the cause. Lucas had been experiencing some troubling symptoms since Fall of 2016, but was reassured that the symptoms were not a sign for concern. Sadly, that was not the case.After being hospitalized, he continued to hear more about his current condition. Current Condition:Lucas is currently hospitalized in San Diego. The team of doctors have informed the family that while their is hope, his condition is severe and will require aggressive treatment in order to save his life.Treatment plan:He remains in the hospital currently. The doctors will place his port today and he will begin chemo. Originally surgery was the first option, however his cancer more advanced than they had hoped and they must first do 3-6 months of chemotherapy, in hopes that it responds well (only 40% of patients respond well to the chemo) and minimize the size of his cancer throughout his abdomen, surgery will then be an option (please join us in praying for that!!). Their current NEED:Lucas is preparing to fight for his life and needs the constant support of his wife Kristen. Their youngest son, Meyer, is just 15 months old and also needs Kristens constant care. For those that know Lucas had just began CRNA school in September and Kristen was to be the only provider during this time. She now needs to devote her time and love to her family.Lucas is a caring husband, father and friend who always helps out in the best way possible. Now Lucas needs our help. There are hundreds out in the world fighting cancer, and we hope Lucas will survive and heal as soon as possible.We thank everyone for all the help, the donation and also the emotional support and  prayers. Please keep him in your prayers in the coming days, weeks and months.",72f50b820d4ea93a8fb4fb29d95b097f,20,0.6189692307692307,90.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

In the early days of 2019, Tara was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer. Being the strong woman we all know she is, Tara is ready to take the fight head-on, but it won’t be easy and will take a toll on her body. This is where we, Tara’s family and friends, get to give back all the love and support Tara has shared with all of us over the years.Throughout all the trials and tribulations, a source of strength above all else, Tara has continued to dream of a future that involves her in the role of ‘mom’.  That’s why we are helping to raise money to freeze her eggs and allow her to focus on her recovery without worrying about day-to-day finances.",10f5a87519fb9ee987b98c3e64b72c56,13,0.19581333333333334,18.0,1,0,0,2,0,2,0,0.006493506493506494,0.0,0.025386996904024767,2.1689650148833097,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

He has been an angelic warrior for decades, and now he needs your help to slay his personal dragon, an aggressive recurrence of his pancreatic cancer.In the five years after plunging his sword into this dragon and watching it tuck its tail and crawl away, he has unselfishly given back in so many ways:  •             inspiring newly diagnosed cancer patients with his story•             working with the Children’s Miracle Network through the Extra Life charity •             using his  skillsets own resources and often his own personal resources to help the Winter Garden Masonic Lodge No. 165 with charities like the  Orlando Autism Society through his work with Panic on Plant Street,•             providing guidance and support for Mimi’s Community Theatre since their first season in Winter Garden, FL.  Mike first became a warrior in 1990 when he joined the Coast Guard. Here, he served in law enforcement performing search and rescue in the Great Lakes, which is where he discovered his passion for helping people.  After becoming a professional dancer, he later studied massage therapy and reiki in order to heal people in a very personal way. He has spent years offering his services to people at a price they can afford instead of lining his pockets. Unfortunately, he neglected to line his own coffers and look out for numero uno, for that’s just not Michael Verona. He’s a giver.On January 16, 2019, Mike was diagnosed with a 1.2 cm mass on his adrenal gland, and another on his lung.  A separate test for neck issues uncovered a 2.5 cm mass on his left frontal lobe (which handles cognitive and motor functions). The follow up MRI showed an additional mass on the right side as well.  The good news is that the metastatic pattern of this cancer is not typical for the pancreatic type he had previously and is hopefully not as aggressive.  Our friend Mike needs the space and funds to recover.  Like most of us in the service industry, heck, in America today, he is only a paycheck or so away from his rent and his bills going unpaid.  He would never ask for money or assistance and would go hungry before he would let someone even buy him a meal, so we’re asking caring and generous people to provide him with the opportunity to be able to focus on his medical treatments and healing for the next few months.  We’re not asking for much because anything will be gratefully accepted, but the more we can collect for him, the better opportunity he will have to be positioned to slay this dragon once and for all.  Send your prayers, your healing energy, and if you have the ability to help him monetarily, so much the better.

Leighton has already finished her first round of Chemotherapy.  According to Doctors, the family's road ahead is long and rocky as Leighton will have to endure a minimum of 1.5 years of intensive treatments and surgeries followed by years of followups and other procedures. She will be spending the majority of her time in hospital.Upon receiving this devastating news, John and Katie both took immediate leaves from their respective careers. John has since lived at the hospital 24/7 by Leighton's side while Katie has split her time between Leighton and raising their 1 year old daughter Hazel.John and Katie would never ask for help but anyone who knows them would agree that they would always be the first to give it. For this reason, both myself as well as John & Katie's closest friends have decided to create this ‘Go Fund Me’ Campaign on their behalf. This young family's road ahead is long and uncertain, with the real possibility of having to explore costly alternative treatment options. It is difficult to predict where this journey will take them or for how long. One thing is for certain however, Leighton is a true ""Warrior Princess"" and she, along with her family, will fight the good fight for as long as it takes. The Bracken’s are a rare family that both myself and many others identify as altruistic, putting others before themselves. Their love, kindness and generosity to all people in this world is only matched by their love of being a part of it.

I will try to make sure I update this page weekly with Ann's progress of BEATING this. From Mitzi and Megan:Did you know that November is Pancreatic Cancer awareness month? Think purple ribbons and Steve Jobs. Sadly, our good friend Ann Parlapiano shares something in common with him. And that’s why we’re wearing a lot of purple here. You see, our good friend—a great girl from Rockford, Illinois—was just diagnosed at 42 with stage 2 pancreatic cancer. Trust us: Nothing good will come of Googling pancreatic cancer. In a nutshell, it is dire. It rocks your world. We’re going to fight. Please join us in this fight and if you can, this Go Fund Me request. This story starts with our former Rockford neighbor and forever friend/partner in crime, Kit Schoonmaker. Kit met Ann in the early 90s and they have been “married” for 20 years. Once WA legalized gay marriage they were finally 2 legit to quit. Ann is loved by her huge Italian family and speaks of them often. How many stories start with Grandma Rose and Grandma Giovingo? Well, A LOT!  Kit and Ann have had some ups and downs but they know they have it pretty darn good. Yes. Kit has been dealing with the loss of her job in tech which has depleted their reserves, but the silver lining is she and Ann have been able to spend time together and enjoy life. Now, they’ve become a force that is ready to kick cancer’s ass. Ann is an X-Ray technologist and works at Good Samaritan Hospital in Puyallup, WA. She is known by friends and colleagues as a jokester (she poo poo’d “ray of sunshine” but that’s also true). Life was plugging right along and Ann, who has always thought she was like Doctor House, self-diagnosed herself with gallbladder issues and sought medical treatment recently. She ended up having her gallbladder removed and was bummed she had to stay off work for 4 weeks (there’s no such thing as light duty when you’re an X-Ray tech). Midway into recovery, Kit and Ann got the call no one wants. Ann was told she had pancreatic cancer, stage 2 to be exact. This is not what anyone wants to hear. So, we drank a little and then we thought we should adult. This diagnosis came from out of nowhere. Being 42 years old, Ann’s medical team said she was too young for this type of cancer. Ann’s condition has to be treated aggressively by specialists to remove the cancer from her pancreas. This procedure is called a Whipple surgery. It’s a very invasive and includes a Frankenstein-like approach that involves removing part of the pancreas, stomach, duodenum (you can Google that), and then attaching the liver duct back into the small intestine. The second silver lining: they caught this relatively early. Ann still has options and qualified for the surgery. Yay!? Had she not, we’d be making end-of-life choices. NO WAY! Ann’s Whipple surgery is scheduled for November 21st. Adulting includes a second opinion so she has one of those lined up too. PANCREATIC CANCER calls for a second opinion. You want to get your team right. The good news is they have two cars that are paid off and they are current on their house payment. The reason for this Go Fund Me request is that cancer is expensive (even with insurance) and we don’t want worry to take away from Ann’s fight, or Kit’s strength that Ann will need. Speaking of needs: Ann will also need a full-time caregiver and that isn’t covered by insurance. Kit has already started to drive Uber while Ann sleeps, but soon she won’t be able to be away. These two require lots of help. This is going to be a battle that will deplete every last resource these two have. If you have ever met Ann, please join us in this fight. If you have never met Ann, know that your donation will not just affect her but everyone who loves and supports her - including her menagerie of Chihuahuas. Ann is a fighter, and while there are tears, she is keeping her sense of humor. If you can donate please know that every dollar will be spent wisely on medical treatments, traveling expenses to obtain treatment from specialists, and help with the loss of Ann’s income. Depending on recovery we don’t know when Ann will be able to return to work. What we know now is that the Whipple surgery comes with an 8-12 week recovery. One month after her surgery she starts aggressive chemotherapy and will participate in an additional radiation study for 6 months. Unfortunately, there is a 50% chance that the cancer will return within 2 years. Financial burden can be one of the worst challenges going into cancer treatment.  If you can spare anything, please donate to the cause so she can focus on fighting. Kit and Ann wanted to make sure that we send thanks to all of the family members and friends from both sides that have been their rock since the diagnosis. Please keep this love flowing big time. **How did we come to the figure of $50,000? We went to Go Fund me and read stories about other pancreatic cancer survivors. We also Googled pancreatic cancer and we are going to tell you cancer is expensive.Thanks Ann's local support team.",991c788943b39baecd3353b0ff97af8a,65,0.2538,780.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Elle a du être hospitalisé à chacune de ses chimio à, laissant ainsi son bébé chez sa mamie, sans qui elle ne pourrait jamais continuer. Bébé Lukas a eu de gros traumatismes liés aux hospitalisations multiples de maman et fait maintenant de l’anxiete et des crises de panique par peur que maman ait à s’absenter encore.Des crises de panique, à 13 mois.

Novembre 2018, elle a du être hospitalisee encore quelques semaines due à des douleurs intenses incontrôlables meme sous morphine. Sans préavis, au hasard d’un scan, ils ont alors découvert à Caro un 2ème cancer, dans le poumon cette fois. Ils ont également refait un TEP scan pour vérifier le cancer initial (uterus) et celui-ci est également de retour.Présentement, les pathologistes spécialistes se rencontrent puisqu’on ne sait pas si les cancers sont liés ou s’il s’agit d’un nouveau cancer qui se développe également à vitesse grand V (ce sont deux cancers classé agressif).Lukas est le seul bébé qu’elle portera à cause du cancer.

I received my degree in music composition from UC at Santa Cruz Ca in 1994.  About 3 plus years ago I noticed that it was becoming more and more difficult for me to sing.  I noticed a loss of range and my voice didn't seem to be healing.  I was mis-diagnosed as having a stomach acid reflex issue almost 2 years ago.  For over a year and a half I did diet and Speech therapy hoping to heal the issue with no positive results.  It really depressed me and greatly affected my ability to perform and earn a living.  Just over a month ago I returned to the throat doctor and was diagnosed as having a stage 4 cancerous tumor that has effectively paralyzed my left vocal chord.  The American doctor’s have recommended an intense regiment of toxic chemo and radiation treatments.   If the chemo/radiation doesn't work, then they want to do surgery and remove my voice box.   They have assured me these treatments are rather painful and terrible and the side effects and long term consequences of these treatments likely include loss of hearing, loss of the ability to speak, loss of the ability to produce saliva or swallow, loss of or damage to the ability to father children, highly increased likely hood of developing other cancers due to radiation exposure, loss of ability to eat.........the list goes on and on. They say they have only a 50/50 chance of reducing my tumor using their destructive and toxic methods.   They have also told me that without treatment they do not expect me to survive more than a year.  I however feel that I am focused and strong, and that I am utterly committed to do what it takes to heal and survive.  I have important work to do in this world and I want to be here for my son, my partner and for you.  I don’t want to do chemo/radiation.  I am holding on to another version of the future where I can heal myself without toxic poison.I request that you donate to this funding campaign to send me to one of the most cutting edge alternative cancer healing facilities in the world.  It is located in Tiajuana, Mexico.  I have heard amazing positive reports from people who have healed themselves there.   This program is not cheap.  It costs close to $25,000 just for 3 weeks at the clinic.  I'm hoping 6 weeks will be enough for me to heal.  I believe it that it will heal me and I am actually really excited about going there (especially considering the alternative).  I have been composing and working on an album for close to 10 years.  I will send you this full album as an acknowledgement of anyone who contributes to help me.  I want everyone to know that I am doing everything I can to heal including exercise, meditation, a no sugar, alcohol, tobacco, gluten, animal products diet.  I want to use this as an opportunity to become a better human being and not a reduced one.  Please remember, time is of the essence.  My goal is to begin treatment in Mexico by July 4th 2017.  You play an active role in saving my life and helping me to sing again.  I ask that you share this with everyone possible in order to reach the goal as quickly as possible.  I and my family thank you from the bottom of our hearts.Blane",ed61f850431ac030fa31206a4431b184,40,0.7189833333333333,570.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

He threw up and was sent home. This officially began the ultimate hurdle that we still don’t fully understand. We took him to the ER and the initial assessment was an appendix rupture. After an ultrasound and CT Scan, doctors found a lump and rushed Nick into emergency surgery. None of my military experience or training could have prepared me to hear the words come out of the doctor’s mouth, “Your son has cancer.”Five surgeries later, he is still fighting. As a disabled combat veteran (Iraq 2xs) who is retired and on a fixed income, our family needs resources to give Nick the best chance at winning. Our medical insurance doesn’t cover much. I'm asking anyone who is able to donate to help us with his bills as we face this unexpected journey. The diagnosis has completely shocked our family to the core but we will not quit.  Nick has an incredible spirit with a heart of Gold. I learned in the Army not to say anything until the mission is complete. While devastating, we know that this battle is not Nick’s ending.

Nov 2014 had surgery to install a Bioflo Mediport for Chemotherapy.  First 6 Chemo Treatments went from Dec. 2014 thru March 2015.  I also got laid off from work during this time and had a hard time finding another job while going through Chemo.

Everything looked well in April 2015 and appeared the cancer was gone.


I got another job but then on August 2015 I was once again Stage 4 with Follicular Lymphoma (Cancer).  I once again started a different chemotherapy but this time we did 12 Chemo treatments from Sept 2015 thru Feb 2016.  The company I worked for went out of buisness and again hard to find another job while doing Chemotherapy. I also started another job in Oct 2015.



Once again everything seem to be going well and cancer appeared to be gone.  


In August of 2016 I was once again was faced with being Stage 4 with Follicular Lymphoma (Cancer).  The doctors decided the next procedure was going to be a bone marrow transplant.  We started all the tests and doing donor testing.  My daughter was the closest match and we were going to do the bone marrow transplant in Oct 2016. 
 I had to leave my job to begin the next medical treatment.  Once again we got hit hard cause the transplant was needing to be pushed due to the fact the cancer grew and was too aggressive to proceed.  We did another 6 chemotherapy treatments from Oct 2016 thru Nov 2017 at Georgetown Hospital.

After the chemotherapy treatments the cancer still grew through the treatments so the Bone Marrow Transplant was canceled until further Notice.


At this point I have done all the different chemotherapy treatments available.  Doctors decided to move to experimental trials Dec 2016.

Test showed the trials was not working and they were discontinued.


Now we are waiting to see if we can get into another experimental procedure gene therapy.  Since the cancer has made it to my bone marrow I am doing one sometimes two blood and platelet transfusions a week since end of Dec 2016.  I am at doctors or hospital 3 times a week min.

This is very hard for me to ask for help however this fight with cancer since Aug 2014 has empty my 401k and savings account.  


When I had to leave my job back in Oct 2016 due to medical treatments,  I applied for Disability but it has not been approved yet and say it will take 6 months to a year before they even give me an answer of yes or no.


I am asking for help due to this fight with cancer that has lasted over 2 yrs and all my funds are gone.  Again this is hard for me to ask for help but I have no where left to turn.",44a2057187bdf881220cdb69cd4c7b5c,29,0.86725,690.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

On July 7, 2014 the amputation was done.  I went through extensive healing and rehab and eventually was fitted with a prosthetic in November of 2014. Months went by before I could return to work and normal activities but I did and I live my life to the fullest. I had x-rays and follow ups every 3 months with my doctor. This was to look for metastases on my lungs. In October, 2015 they saw spots on my lungs in my x-rays.  After doing a CT scan the doctor informed me that the cancer is back and had metastasized to both lungs. The doctor told me it is stage 4 and offered aggressive chemotherapy treatments which I started November 30th, 2015.  I was told that the chemo will not cure me but will give me a chance for more time.  The prognosis for this kind of cancer has a median of one year with aggressive chemo treatments.  But I'm not most patients..... I want to fight!!!  I will fight with everything I've got and with my family by my side.  Because of all that we are in need some help....It's hard for me to ask for help...

This rollercoaster called life has its ups and downs, its moments of tense apprehension, excitement and occasionally stomach-churning twists. My sister's journey is one of those twists where we find ourselves at the mercy of life begging for more time but knowing we don’t have long to say goodbye.It was March 5th of last year (2017) that my sister found a lump on her breast. Concerned, she contacted her doctor and they thought it might have been a cyst and an infection due to the pain. After some tests and a biopsy on the 14th she got a call two days later with the bad news; it was breast cancer. On March 20th she met with her oncologist who confirmed it was Stage 2 Triple-Negative Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. It’s a very aggressive cancer but was treatable and curable so she moved forward just as aggressively.            March 28 she began her chemotherapy. Round one was to be eight weeks of Adriamycin and Cytoxan together, a brief intermission then round two, twelve weeks of Taxol and all the side effects that go along with it. If it worked, it would be worth it. Along with the chemotherapy she opted for a double mastectomy, it was clear she was going to do what she could to beat this. She went in for surgery on September 28 and post operation we found out the that cancer had not shrunk during the chemotherapy treatment and it was still active. So, the oncologist recommended 6 more months of a different type of chemotherapy called Xeloda which is used to stop the spread of cancer cells and started on December 5th.            Around late November, she started having some serious back pain. She talked to her pain management doctor, tried a few medical options to manage pain, which they thought was related to the chemo. After a few weeks without relief, they thought maybe it was a pinched nerve and scheduled an MRI for January 2nd. The next day she got a phone call from the oncologist saying he needed to see her right away. Lesions, multiple lesions on her lower spine and now it appears the Xeloda isn’t working. The next few weeks are full of MRI’s, PET scans, labs and a surgical procedure to see what is going on. At that point her doctor stops the chemotherapy. If he’s wrong they can restart, but if his hunch is right this cancer has spread and is now treatable but no longer curable.            January 16th, it is confirmed that our sister has metastatic cancer; bone cancer. The PET scan comes back lit up in the lower spine, pelvis, and hip; with a small spot on the liver. Her doctor switches to radiation to slow the progression through her hip and to manage her pain. They decide to do a liver biopsy to confirm that there is or is not cancer in her liver. Oh, and there is new chemotherapy to come.            Since the January 23rd liver biopsy it is confirmed that the cancer has spread to her liver. It is small, and the biopsy essentially removed most of it but it is still there. So now it is January 29th and there is cancer in her bones and her liver and she will be doing radiation and another chemotherapy called Halaven with regularly scheduled PET scans. This is how the remainder of her fight will look. There is no cure. This cancer will continue to grow and spread until it takes her life. They will continue to treat her to offer more time until the inevitable time comes where we have to talk about quality of life. Her oncologist gives 1-2 years IF she responds favorably to all treatments, which she hasn't so far.             So there are the facts of our sister’s fight with cancer, and all of this while she and her husband are raising two girls ages 5 and 14, homeschooling them, and trying to manage all of the side effects of chemotherapy, while scheduling appointments that are increasingly bringing bad news, and driving multiple times a week to various locations for things like IV fluids, radiation, chemo treatments, and additional tests. This is one fight that no one prepares for but upon its arrival must be faced head on if victory is to be attempted. Family, despite our differences and shortcomings, is the bond we share with whom we love. Our sister has some of us around her here near Chicago and in Indiana doing all we can, but some of us are a thousand miles away in North Carolina doing everything we can to help.Here is where you come in. All of this cancer treatment comes with a price, even the best medical coverage doesn’t cover the cost of travel to and from the chemotherapy clinic, or the pain clinic, or the grocery store for over-the-counter options. It may help with the medical side of things, but not with vehicle costs, and lost income, and time stolen away from two young girls who need their mommy more than ever, or a husband who is doing what he can for his wife despite the ravages of this deadly disease. I should also mention that while many families may have planned for final expenses with life insurance, there are just as many who have yet to do so; catch is there isn’t an insurance company that would take on a patient knowing the end is so near. Who plans to have their life cut short? Who plans to say goodbye to their 5-year-old daughter, or their 14-year-old teen? No one. No one plans for this and our sister is no exception. We need your help, anything is appreciated, and with looming costs of more treatment, and more travel, moving expenses to bring them to North Carolina and eventually the end; our family, like many others dealing with cancer, needs your help. She and her husband regularly attend church and are believers in Christ and have been raising their daughters in the Christian faith; I know that when she leaves us she will grace the halls of heaven with her terrible singing voice. So, as of mid January 2018 we have up to 12-24 months of time left with our sister, and her with her family. We have up to 12-24 months until we have to watch a husband lose his wife, daughters lose their mother, and our family lose a piece of us we’ve had for the last 38 years. Such a short time left to sit around that table and laugh, and cry, and love until we have to say goodbye.",9dc2e3553e2d32964568c32f818f0cf0,50,0.6607333333333333,330.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

The events leading up to this started back in March with periods of fatigue, pain and weakness in his left leg/thigh. However not enough to prevent him from continuing to play College hockey for Providence. On March 21st during a playoff game against New Hampshire, Drew really took a hit to his left leg.  After the impact on the ice, he had difficulty bearing his own weight with exhausting days of ongoing pain. His physicians at Providence ordered an MRI on April 22nd. The following day Drew was notified that the results of the MRI showed a suspicious tumor. Coach arranged for him to be sent to home to receive on-going care at the University of Michigan Hospital.  He flew home to Michigan on Thursday, April 24th and had a biopsy scheduled for the following Monday. The shocking diagnosis was Ewing Sarcoma Cancer, which was 1 in a million chance and just…. unbelievable. 


Additionally a full body bone scan and many images of his organs reveled that his cancer has not spread. Praise God! 


With his family by his side, they immediately scheduled a procedure to have a port placed. He began his first of many rounds of chemotherapy a few days later. He has done fairly well with his first week of chemo. 


So with all of that being said, these few weeks have been a challenging time. We were all given this nightmare without any time to prepare and have had to act quickly. 


We have many positive things to concentrate on…. 


Drew has a loving, faithful family standing beside him, a fun and supportive group of friends, a very determined, strong-willed team of Providence Friars fighting for him, many caring Lions from Kent and  a very loyal community of Bulldogs from Chelsea. 


His diagnosis came very early in the cancer cycle. 


His care was established and he was able to start treatment very quickly. 


He is young, fit and a very physically and mentally strong young man. 


He is a patient at the University of Michigan which is top in the nation and within 45 miles of his home. 


It is very evident that Drew has touched many lives around the world, as the outpouring of love and kindness has been extraordinary! Not just from family, friends and team mates but complete strangers who have reached out to us offering sweet words of encouragement, prayers and advice. 


Despite the incredible support from family and friends, the financial strain of his care is starting to become a worry. Medical deductibles, specialty equipment and travel expenses should not become an obstacle for them. Please consider lifting the burden with a donation to his family in addition to including them in your prayers. 


The next 8 to 13 months are going to be filled with treatment but with all of the sweet words of encouragement, heartfelt prayers and loved filled hearts he will beat this. 


Ewing Sarcoma is a cancer that is curable and Drew Looks forward to beating it and being back on the ice with his team as soon as possible! Please join us in the fight as we spread hope and awareness to all. We can and will CRUSH CANCER!

Every time I have felt like I have finally won the battle, there’s been indications that my cancer didn’t respond well to treatment, and that it was making a rapid comeback.⁣⁣After the news that my last treatment didn’t go as planned, both former medical teams in Miami and New York left me with very little options for continuing my fight. From their stand point, there was less than a 10% chance of getting me cured.⁣⁣I followed my intuition for a second opinion. I told my family and fiancé that I wanted a consult with MD Anderson, in Houston Texas, the #1 cancer center in the US. ⁣⁣This week in Texas, I was presented with viable options that could save my life. The doctor recommended radiation therapy along side a clinical trial infusion. I’ll be undergoing radiation every week-day for four weeks, and will be administered the infusion every 3 weeks for at least four sessions, or longer if there is progress. ⁣⁣The past 18 months have been extremely difficult for my family, my fiancé, and myself. Everyone’s focus has been solely on me and my fight against cancer, willing to take any measures available to bring me closer to remission.⁣⁣Because cancer forced me to step away from a career in banking, my parents and fiancé have managed to support me financially thus far, so that my only stress and worries would be the fight ahead. ⁣⁣My soon to be wife will be taking unpaid leave in order to be by my side in this next step of treatment. My mother, who’s already exhausted much of her leave of absence, and my father, will be taking turns flying to Texas to assist in my care giving. In the coming days we will have to find a temporary housing solution in Texas, where I’ll be staying for the next couple months. ⁣⁣Your donations will help take some of the burden off my family and fiancé. These funds will help pay medical bills, flights to and from Houston, housing costs while there and the day to day expenses of living. ⁣⁣Thank you for your support.⁣⁣GOD bless you,⁣⁣Adrian Morales⁣—Adrian’s Cancer Journey (YouTube):  https://youtu.be/70rkwRVnavc?t=2sInstagram: AdrMorales",cc67f44d4428d27f4f270df3cde252a4,18,1.0104375,120.0,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I want to thrive and will do anything and everything I can to survive and overcome this cancer so I can make a difference in the world.Around October of 2014, I began to feel severe pain in my hip, excruciating enough that I was wheelchair-bound and unable to walk. The next few weeks were swamped with numerous doctors’ appointments all over the state, consulting via Skype with doctors in Europe, and undergoing constant tests from which I discovered there was a tumor in my pelvis. By December 2014, I was officially diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma, a rare childhood bone cancer that yielded me less than a 50% chance of surviving 5 years with conventional therapy.To make a very long story short, my family and I endured initial panic followed by months of stress, endless research, and sleepless nights, all amidst agonizing pain episodes and countless cancer treatments and their side effects. My odds were not at all favorable, and as a result we explored and researched both conventional and experimental treatment options all around the world. Until this past fall, very few people knew I had been battling cancer as I still had all of my hair and was for the most part looking healthier than ever. Unfortunately, my cancer metastasized in July (progressing to Stage IV) and they found tumors throughout my pelvis, legs and spine. Some of my vertebrae were fractured and I had no choice but stay bed-ridden in the hospital as I could not walk or move much at all and was in an immeasurable amount of pain. From there I started the rough journey through several rounds of high dose chemo and all of its difficult side effects, and am on the path to super high dose chemo (30x the strength of the high dose) followed by a stem cell transplant rescue. Basically they poison and kill all my bone marrow bringing me to the edge and then rescue me with my own stem cells they already harvested from me (twice). It is very frightening and risky but seems to be one of the best solutions at this point either for a cure or to buy more time well into the future. Will this be the cure?...the outcomes are mixed across the board. Some have been cured, some have relapsed, some it extended their time on earth and some have passed on...Bless all of them. But most of the effective immunotherapy and less damaging treatments are in trial phases and require the patient to fail all the chemo and conventional treatments before they let me try them. Others may be available in other countries but that is also very expensive. Bottom line is that I have a rare pediatric cancer and it is not a priority for the cancer industry to find a cure since the market is small and less profitable.As of February 2016, I am heading into my 8th round of high dose chemotherapy which is helping but starting to have some serious side effects on my body.This has been the hardest year of my life, but I can’t even truly put into words my desire to beat this. You see, my goal is not to be a cancer survivor. I want to be a victor, a conqueror. Surviving is not enough––I want to LIVE, I want to THRIVE. I take an interesting perspective on this hardship; in fact, I've asked myself ""What if cancer is the cure?"" This is because my whole life has changed since being diagnosed. As ironic as it seems, in many ways I am healthier now than I've ever been. Even as a teenager, I've learned to make health and nutrition a top priority, I've learned to forgive and to find emotional balance, and I've learned not to take things, people, or circumstances for granted and to go after opportunities that I truly want, because they will not always be there. I've met so many different people––doctors, patients, survivors––and I've heard their stories and seen how they can have such a significant effect on someone else's life, which in turn has inspired me to be that for others. I don't know if I would have necessarily found this drive if it weren't for this experience.However, as you can imagine, all of this is very expensive. We are exhausting all possible resources to find the best treatments possible, and I refuse to leave any stone unturned. We have sent biopsies of my tumors to grow on mice in an attempt to try different therapies. We have found several supportive therapies to try to overcome the cancer long term and help with the side effects of chemo. Unfortunately these are not covered by any insurance and our out of pocket expenses are huge.Any support you can offer is very much appreciated. Five dollars, a hundred dollars––it all makes a difference and helps me out a lot. If you can’t afford it, please do not donate. Your prayers, thoughts, and good vibes are all just as important and they mean so much to me. So many people have helped my family and I out in so many different ways and I can’t express how special, loved and supported you all have made me (us) feel. Please give if you can. Please pray no matter your faith. Be positive and tell all those close to you that you love them and appreciate them. From the bottom of my heart please accept my love and gratitude. Thank you so much for your support, I can’t wait to get back out there in the world and make a difference.Love always,Allie Oetken",25a1c52b102eec49b232d3759b91bf96,38,0.6905,1050.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

She was diagnosed with a rare cancer called desmoplastic small round cell tumor.  It is a sarcoma that has little concern for the havoc that it creates.   She is fortunate to be treated at one of the very few hospitals in the world that has seen and treated this cancer successfully.  Her doctors and care team are incredible. Her family is close and are with her round the clock but life continues on. The bills don't stop just because their own lives have come to an abrupt standstill.  They are surrounded by incredibly loving and compassionate people who are beside them through the stress, the pain, the joy, and the tears but the burdens remain.There is nothing you or I can do to take this diagnosis from them and it is a path that they will be on for many many months. But, we can help with the financial burden. If we can take the load off so they can pay expenses such as hospital bills, travel (Z may need to travel to another hospital in a few months), medication, equipment, etc. they will have one less thing to worry about and can be beside Z as she exchanges the freedom of childhood for the isolation of illness.Please share this page freely and donate as you feel compelled.  Z and her parents are grateful for anything that is contributed.  If you choose not to donate but instead fall to your knees and say a prayer for all of them it will be equally appreciated.Follow and Join  FB group Zandra's Journey  https://www.facebook.com/groups/401374783934134/ for updates and other ways to help.",9ff6e4b9993c22834f40332d34d2b9ad,13,0.25825,7.0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

For those of you who know him, you know that he is an extraordinary human being. He is always cheerful, loving, UNBELIEVABLY STRONG and always puts his friends and family before anything else. 

He underwent chemo and various other procedures starting at the end of December 2017 to help try to slow the growth of the cancer (his case is “very aggressive”) , which was successful.  But, with further testing cancerous cells are still being detected throughout his bones and some soft tissue. As a result, he is still having to undergo chemothearapy on a regular basis and we are nearing July of 2018.  

Because of this, he has been unable to work and will not be able to return to work indefinitely.  His retirement unfortunately can only touch the very tip of the iceberg when it come to the expenses that come along with fighting an illness like Cancer.  Many of his medical expenses and medicines are not covered by insurance and with the everyday necessities of life, money is getting tighter and tighter.

To top everything off, both AC units at their home have decided to go out this summer. Mom and dad both have been confined to their bedroom where we have purchased a window unit to help them stay as cool as possible for the time being until we can raise the funds to fix the AC. With the unbearable heat of Arkansas summers their room is still a blistering 87 degrees with the rest of the house in the upper 90’s. It’s no comfortable place to return after treatment to rest and get better. 

Victor is one of the strongest, most selfless people I have ever known and is always there to give his love and support or the shirt off his back to anyone that needs it.  So much so that he would never ask anyone for financial help himself and would still claim that someone else could use the help worse.

Now, it's time that we give back some of that love and support to Vic.  Anything you can donate will be more appreciated than you could ever imagine.  Everything we can do to help surround him with love is what is most important so he can focus on beating this thing.  Please help us to spread the word!!! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!

He is a healthy 26 year old so the news came as a shock to us all.  Travis started having an unusual pain in his shoulder blade and a few weeks later noticed a lump on his lower neck. He was put on antibiotics for a week hoping it would get better, but one week passed and he found another lump on his lower neck. He had a CT scan, and on January 23rd he received the devastating news that it looked like Lymphoma. On January 27th he had surgery to remove the lymph node for a biopsy. The biopsy came back inconclusive so it was sent to Mayo Clinic, where they said it looked like testicular cancer. Another CT scan would determine that it was testicular cancer and he had a tumor in one of his testicles. Travis had surgery on February 7th to put in a port for chemotherapy, and on February 9th, had surgery to remove the testicle with the tumor. His treatment started on February 20th and will consist of 6 more rounds of chemo over the next 4 and a half months. So far, the chemo has made Travis very weak, tired, and nauseas. He will be unable to work for the next several months putting a financial burden on him and his family. If anyone can pull through this it's Travis, but he will be going through difficult treatment and will need all the support he can get.

We praised God and celebrated this blessing for one month before she was unexpectedly diagnosed with Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer.We sought 2nd, 3rd and 4th opinions on Sara's treatment plan and the overwhelming medical advice was to immediately terminate the pregnancy and begin very aggressive cancer treatment. There was a lot of uncertainty if Sara would live long enough without aggressive radiation and chemotherapy to bring the baby to term.After much prayer, we committed to do whatever we could for the unborn baby even if it placed Sara at additional risk. We were blessed to find a doctor who understood this vision and he helped us shape a treatment protocol that would not injure the baby but could offer some help for Sara during the pregnancy as well.During the 2nd trimester, Sara had a bowel resection surgery.  A doctor from our OB/GYN team literally moved the uterus and fetus aside by hands while the Gastroenterology surgeon removed over a foot of intestine from beneath it. The womb was then reseated, Sara was closed up and the surgery was successful.During the 3rd trimester, Sara had a kind of chemotherapy that wouldn't cross the umbilical to the baby. It was a very scary time and much of what we did was not common medical practice. Alice was born on May 9th, 2012. She was (and still is) perfectly healthy.I know for a fact God protected Alice in the womb. We were surrounded by a great cloud of prayers from believers all over the world. With the baby safely delivered, Sara was finally able to have a CT scan to check the progression of the disease.  It was at this time that it was discovered to have metastasized to the liver into a large centrally located tumor. So the intensity of Sara's treatment was turned up to 11! In the last 6 years we have had over 50 chemo treatments, many radiation treatments and a about a dozen surgeries. Sara’s latest CT scan showed tumor growth in the liver, lungs, lymph nodes and growth in a new area as well. The goal of the past two years has been maintenance, meaning it isn’t likely the treatments available to us now will lead to full remission but we can try to limit the growth of the tumors.We are currently pursuing new clinical trials that might offer the hope of full healing but there are a lot risks involved with experimental treatment, and we have had difficulty being admitted due to Sara’s liver function test (bilirubin) being so variable because of disease around the bile ducts.Despite the limitations of the cancer treatments available to us, I still believe full healing is possible with God. I’ve learned a lot of about patience, faith and hope over the last years.It is very humbling to have to ask for financial assistance but there has been a great outpouring of generosity to us. Our home church, Saturn Road Church of Christ, has been amazingly generous and supportive to us over the past 6 years. The leaders and individual members have always been there when I’ve asked for help. Many meals have been prepared with love for us, many baked good mysteriously appear on our doorstep, leaves have been raked and during the first year of treatment some amazing people organized a fundraiser for us that erased the first year of medical debt and left us enough saved to cover another year of expenses with less financial anxiety.There are literally too many examples of the generosity from Saturn Road Church of Christ and from our friends and family in other places to mention. We will be forever indebted to them for their love and sacrifice for us. After I reached out online for prayers, multiple Christian Champions I know reached back to me and recommended I start a Go Fund Me page so that people could easily help us. This has been a common suggestion from people close to me but I hesitated. But with the fact that so many people I know and love are all giving me the same advice I’m forced to see this a prodding from the Holy Spirit to accept more help. I am grateful for the believers from all over the world who have reached out and offered to help us. I recently heard at a Ray Vander Laan Bible Seminar that a Jewish Rabbi believes that turning down an offer to help is tantamount to breaking the 8th Commandment. When you deny someone the chance to help you are stealing from them an opportunity to serve God. These words have haunted me. Even though I have accepted a lot of help over the years there is a still a prideful part of me that wants to think I can do this alone. For years I’ve gotten messages from people at dozens of churches who tell me they are praying for Sara. This cloud of prayers is what has fueled us on this marathon journey. I have no expectation (and you should feel no obligation) to meet the amount we have asked for on this website but we had to put in something. Even a few hundred dollars would help us our as right now our financial situation is more stressed than it has been even over the last few years. In October, our kitchen had a flood and the additional costs have been trying, we were already living paycheck to paycheck. Both of our cars have trouble. One is on its last legs and isn’t reliable and the newer car runs well but currently has no AC or heating which makes for some chilly drives to school in the morning. To speak plainly, when we did our last major accounting of our medical debts they were around $37,000 but this doesn’t account for new treatments surgeries accrued in the latter half of 2017, which we have to run through the insurance to be sure that everything was properly billed. Some of our debts is on a credit card we had to use to cover travel expenses back and forth to MD Anderson in Houston, we usually make 8 or more trips there a year. Please join us in praying for healing for Sara. I pray for her daily and pray thanksgiving to God for all the blessings he’s given to us even during this trying time. We still have good times as a family, the girls still laugh, we make memories. Our church family has always taken care of us and our friends have always been there when we needed help watching the girls whether its a day of chemo or a week for surgery.No matter what happens we will follow where God leads us. Even in some of the worse moments we have found a way to praise God and lean not on our own understanding. I don’t know why this is happening to us or what God has in store for us but God has already proven to the world how much he loves us by sending his Son to die for our sins. That battle is already won and is the center of our lives as a family. Even so, God told us to ask, seek and knock so join me in asking for healing in prayer.Please share this link with compassionate people you know who may perhap help out with a donation.Above all pray.Thank you,Trey LaminackOn behalf of Sara, Clara and AlicePSALM 103:1-51 Bless the Lord, O my soul,And all that is within me, bless His holy name.2 Bless the Lord, O my soul,And forget none of His benefits;3 Who pardons all your iniquities,Who heals all your diseases;4 Who redeems your life from the pit,Who crowns you with loving kindness and compassion;5 Who satisfies your years with good things,So that your youth is renewed like the eagle.",950aa0c27d58c1218dd20cd898ccb484,46,1.3382,330.0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

On Friday, March 10, doctors discovered the cancer has metastasized to his liver. The diagnosis of stage 4 adenocarcinoma was devastating. Chris began the first part of treatment on March 13. The chemo is given in 2 week cycles and is planned for 8 weeks. Next he must go in for radiation Monday through Friday at which point the chemo will be on a pump that runs seven days a week - this will last for 6 weeks. Following this is surgery for the rectal and liver masses, and more chemo for an undetermined amount of time. At each step of treatment doctors will reassess the plan. The cancer’s response will determine if the plan needs to change.The side effects from this treatment are such that Chris will not be able to work at full capacity, if at all. This diagnosis comes at a transitional time for the Malloy family, as Chris was starting a new job. He had resigned from his current job and cannot begin his new one yet. As many of you know, Chris has a wife and three young daughters.

It's hard to receive but I trust God for health and healing.  The treatment I will be receiving is at a center called Hope4Cancer in Cancún, Mexico. At the treatment center, they do Sono-Photo Dynamic therapy and Virotherapy. They also focus on immune health, detoxification, whole food nutrition, hydration, and energy balance in order to create an environment in which I may fully receive the treatments needed to let my immune system fight off the cancer naturally.  Instead of carrying traditional insurance, I am part of a Christian community that shares medical expenses called Samaritan Ministries. Samaritan Ministries will provide coverage for a portion of the cost of my treatment plan. However, there is also an upfront cost that is required upon my arrival and Samaritan’s will not be able to provide coverage until after treatment. Your support will help with the upfront cost, fill in the gaps for medical expenses and offset living expenses while I am in treatment. My sister, Colleen, and I will be traveling to the Hope4Cancer institute Monday, August 14th to start treatment promptly. Due to the nature of the cancer and the availability of the center we are thankful for the opportunity to be accepted into the program so quickly. My hope is in the Lord to provide, but I also realize I have a wonderful community willing to fight this battle with me. Thank you for all of your wonderful prayers and support—The last few weeks have been a whirlwind. I am sorry if this is how you are finding out.

My brothers and I were raised by Ilona, a single mother for many years, just trying to provide a healthy home for her children. In 2003 we found out my mother had developed stage three breast cancer. We were very young and didn’t quite understand the gravity of the situation. Luckily the wonderful staff and friends at Hospice helped our family through the hardest of years. Ilona remained cancer free for 12 years. In July of 2015, my mom had slipped and fallen down some steps (which our family soon found out would be a blessing in disguise). She began to experience severe back pain, and finally, we were able to convince her to see a doctor for the pain.Multiple tests were performed including an MRI. The test results revealed that not only had she fractured the T12 bone in her spine, she had developed a tumour with several lesions on her bones. It turned out my mom had developed Metastatic Breast Cancer. The cancer that started in her breast years ago, has now spread into her spine.During this past summer my mother began to rapidly lose weight and further tests and MRI scans revealed that there were more lesions appearing on her bones. Currently her state of health is decreasing, resulting in a weight of under 100 pounds and even losing 2 inches in height.The first round of cancer brought on a world of pain for my mother. Radiation and Chemo therapy drew every ounce of strength from her body as it has done to countless others in similar situations. After finding out about the new cancer, she decided to pursue other means of treatment. My mom has been in contact with many research groups and hospitals to try and find a better alternative to conventional cancer treatment methods, but until recently she had no success.After months and months of research and consultations with Doctors at the Garson clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, she has been approved to go and receive the treatment she desires. However, the financial burden would be too great for our family to overcome.The treatment lasts 21 days in total and provides her with 8 different methods of immunotherapy. This is the treatment that she has been looking for, for so long. Giving her the opportunity to go to this facility would bring a great deal of happiness and health not only to her but to my brothers and I. But of course, nothing worth while in this world is free, the treatment comes with a price tag of $28,650 USD (approx. $38,000 CAD).We are reaching out to all of our wonderful friends and family to try and help us raise the funds needed to help her. Please reach into your hearts and help us send Ilona away so that she can return healthy and happy again. Even if you can’t spare any money, please spare a second and share our story in the hopes that others might be able to help.

We currently live in Reno Nevada, and are having to regularly travel to Salt Lake City, Utah for his treatment. Both his mother and I work in the service industry which has no paid time off or benefits, so the travel has caused substantial financial strain on our family, as we both had to take a leave of absence to accommodate his treatment schedule. We are asking for donations to help with travel expenses for his treatment, as well and to help alleviate some of the normal financial stress such as rent and living expenses during our son's time of need. FULL STORY:On April 22, 2017 our 4 month old baby boy was diagnosed with stage 4 Metastatic Neuroblastoma, a rare form of cancer which starts in the adrenal glands and quickly spreads all throughout the body. It started as a small pea sized bump on his abdomen, which the doctors said was no cause for worry. Then very quickly several small bumps appeared strictly on his abdominal area. The doctors had no clue what they could be and he seemed to be happy and healthy, so again they told us there was no need to worry. The bumps continued to multiply and grow in size and we brought him in 3 more times before they finally did a CT scan. Shortly after the doctor rushed into the room with the bad news. He has small tumors all over his body, including his liver, lungs, kidneys, testicles, all over his abdomen and even one over his eye.We left for Utah on April 2nd, 2017 for his first round of treatment and this first trip has already drained most of our savings account. I've never been one to ask for help, but I won't be able to work as I need to be there for my son through these rough treatments. His treatment will last a minimum of 9 months which puts a pretty steep financial burden on our family as we still need to pay bills, eat, and afford all the travel expenses that come along with his treatment. Each trip to Utah costs roughly $1200 and we will need to go twice a month for the next 9 months. We also need to keep up on other expenses during that time. I plan on working whenever I can but the financial stress is already starting to weigh heavily, and this is just the start of our journey.I'm setting our goal for $25,000. That will cover travel costs, living expenses, and out of pocket medical expenses that come with his treatment over the next 9 months. I know that it seems like a large number but I'm going to stay hopeful. Please help however you can, and share this with your friends and family. This takes a lot for me to swallow my pride and ask for help but if that's what I have to do to be there for my little guy, then I'll do it.I'll keep you all updated throughout our journey and if you you have any questions don't hesitate to ask.

The pons is responsible for vital functions such as breathing, swallowing, coordination, balance and heart rate. It primarily affects children between 5-11 Years old. Teens and adults can have DIPG although its extremely rare.  DIPG is considered  terminal with only 9-12 months median survival of patients upon diagnosis. Only 10-20 % of DIPG patients survive up to two years.  For more information on DIPG visit  http://dipgregistry.org/patients-families/about-dipg/dipg.org .Our Family: I am TJ Pelagio, a restaurant manager in the Philippines and my wife is Che, a work-at-home mom.  Trinity  was born approximately 3 years after we got married so you could say that having her was long overdue. She is the first grandchild on both sides and very much the big doting sister to all of her four cousins. Trinity likes YouTube videos, video games, Steven Universe, Adventure Time, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Barbie and slime and crafting among other things . It really does not make sense how she got sick because her favorite food consists mainly of healthy food such as fruits, fish, broccoli, and yogurt (she would say she prefers it over ice cream).How it startedThe month of March 2018 started very busy for Trinity with the final exams and the last days of school approaching.  We thought she was just being stressed out when she complained of headaches throughout the day.  Then we noticed she was beginning to tilt her head on to one side when she which we thought as plain old mannerism. But during the course of another week she began vomiting. She vomited almost everyday during the mornings and sometimes after eating in the afternoon.  This prompted us to take her to the clinic where the pediatrician told us to keep her from eating dairy and chocolates due to stress.  Same doctor also sent us to see an eye doctor to test her vision to see if it was causing the headaches.  The ophthalmologist told us there was nothing wrong with her vision so that left us with the dairy abstinence.  After that first trip to the doctors we were optimistic that everything was just part of her puberty acting up. The next few days there was no vomiting but she was still in pain.  Her headache made her didn't want to get out of bed and it was that time that school was over so she was just lying in her room most of the time.  One day she and Che went to her school to pick up her final school cards and then decided to meetup with her classmates at the mall. They went and did what normal kids do at the mall, arcade, frappuccinos, and even ""nerf tag"".  During lunch time after eating a lot of chicken wings, Trinity asked to go to the restroom and then suddenly threw up everything she ate.  Che knew then we needed to take her back to the doctor.  We decided to consult a new pediatrician recommended by Che's sister.  The new doctor noticed she had sinus problems which may contribute to her headache but asked us to do a CT Scan to put our worries to rest.  It was after that test it seems, that our worries escalated to pure horror and shock.  The scan detected a mass in in her brain and we were told to get an MRI to get a more detailed image of the mass.  These terms were very new to my wife and me: MRI, CT Scan, and it was even our first time to ride an ambulance that day as the MRI service was not available in the hospital that we were admitted.    The Diagnosis:Like I said, everything was very new to us and all these medical stuff were being shoved to our brains very fast.  I do not know how MRI scans go but after taking Trinity through a stretcher inside a noisy machine for 1 hour, we got handed the big envelope where the negative prints were and a piece of paper which contains what looks like an initial analysis of the image that was taken of my daughters brain.  I saw my wife’s hand weaken as she read the paper, almost dropping it in the process.  I took it from her and read it and saw the words tumor and “blastoma” which I would come to know later as synonymous with cancer.  After the scan we found out that pediatric neurologists were very few in this country and we would likely see the one who could read the scans to us within the next 48 hours. Our kind doctor recommended that if we wished, we can move her to another hospital if we knew another pedia neurologist who can take our case.  Luckily, Che has good friends in the medical field and they have helped us get transferred to a better hospital and coordinated for us to get our diagnosis sooner.  Nothing could have prepared us the for the worst news of our lives.  We got to be introduced to four dreaded letters:D.I.P.G. It is a rare form of brain tumor that is inoperable and incurable.  I can remember holding back my tears as I listened to the doctor explain to us all these medical terms some of which I really did not bother to listen.  As soon as the words “9-12 months to live” was mentioned my mind just involuntarily shut itself and dread and shock came over.  I remember my wife was blankly staring into the doctors eyes.  She was repeating her words and struggling to form new sentences to say.We were advised that the prescribed treatment  is 30 sessions of Radio Therapy which blasts the tumor with concentrated X-rays with the purpose of attempting to shrink the tumor down to size but never actually taking it out.  We were told that after the therapy Trinity may experience alleviated symptoms for a couple of months.  Che asked what I was thinking: ""what happens after that?” to which the Doctor replied  ""then we may expect her symptoms to gradually worsen afterwards"". I can hear my heart broke into thousand pieces.

Our Plan:It has been almost two months since that fateful day at the hospital and we are already on last week of Trinity's Radio Treatment sessions.  I have spent that time researching learning more on this disease and what other options do we have.  I have learned that in the US and Australia,  children with DIPG have undergone clinical trials which means that while it has no cure yet,  kids together with their parents are fighting to find it.A little over a year ago Che and I were working and saving up to migrate to Australia.   I qualified for a skilled migration program and all the money we earned the past year up to now has been put into this endeavor of ours.  Now that we are days away from getting our visa approved, our plan is to go to Australia and look for more options for Trinity's treatment.  We have only saved enough to support us for a few months until we get settled in this new country and with my daughter's condition it is certain that our medical expenses will accumulate really fast.  So we want to be prepared.  More over, Trinity will begin to have special needs when her symptoms come back and we would like for her to be as comfortable as possible and again come prepared.How you can helpMy wife and I are asking everyone who reads this to help us extend our daughter's life. Help us bring her to Australia to look for more treatment and at the same time make more experiences with her in this new country.  She is the only one we have and she has been the motivation for every single thing we have done in our lives. She is so excited to come to Australia and she is even planning everything she is going to do there even how her room is going to look like.  She has a heart of gold and a soft spot for all animals which makes her a perfect fit to live there.  Help us make her wishes come true.  With your donations, our family can hit two birds in one stone:1. Look for clinical trials in Australia which may and can extend her life, and 2. fulfill Trinity’s bucket list and experience more of the country making her life full of memories and moments with us.  We hope that this fund raising campaign  will be successful so that we can spend more quality time with Trinity without the stress of worrying about the finances.  No amount is too small.  Your kindness and generosity will surely get us through this trying time in more ways you can ever imagine. We thank you for the time you took to read this and we hope that God rewards your kindness.  Please click the share button.",e48eb2601b2547edd3cb06a49fab0f0d,68,0.2739333333333333,240.0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

And hearing that diagnosis at a young age, an age when you feel as if you are in the prime of your life, is a deafening sound reverberating throughout your whole being. This story is of a young woman's journey through a life experience that is an extradinary battle, with a foe that no one wants to engage, but one that with strength, love, and perserverance can be beat. My beautiful daughter, Sarah, was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 29. At the time of her diagnosis, she was in the middle of aquiring a Master's degree at the University of Wyoming in the field of Experimental Psychology and working toward her Doctorate in the same field. Her somewhat neurotic mindset was a blessing in disguise, as to noticing a slight abnormality on the skin of her breast, something probably unnoticable to most, caused her concern and to seek out medical consultation. Breast Cancer was the diagnosis, and quickly a devastating and confusing world was thrust upon her. A world traditionally reserved for those of her mother's age and beyond, not that of a young 29 year old woman. Alarmingly throughout this journey, she was to discover how common younger and younger woman were being diagnosed with this disease and the need for her age group to be more informed. The long process of chemotherapy, loss of hair, impaired body image, pain usually associated with much older people, fatigue, and financial burden was overwhelming.  But through all this immense struggle, my daughter, maintained high grades in her academic endeavor, became a published first author in a highly accredited academic journal, published as co-author in other journal publications, and graduated with a PHD in Experimental Psychology. She continued to live and love, and with that unbreakable smile beat the cancer that threatened her life.  Unfortunately, we all know that Cancer is a disease that does not always stay down when beaten. Sarah is now 33 years old, and again is fighting the battle of her life. She has just been diagnosed with Stage 4 Cancer,  since some has spread to her bone. She's not giving up the fight, and is ready to take it on again, but financially she is suffering greatly, still paying for the first round with this unrelentless foe.  She will continue to fight with the strength, humor, and tenacity that is in every fiber of her being. She's not one to ask for help, but as her mother, who is so very proud of her accomplishments, her strength, and her love of life and others, would ask for that help for her. Anything to help ease some of the burden of the fight that she is now facing. Please ""like"" and share Sarah's story.  We appreciate your prayers and words of encourgement.

In the coming weeks I scrambled through various connections to get in to see a great oncologist at Johns Hopkins.  Because I was not showing any other major symptoms, my oncologist chose to do another biopsy to see if I had a mutation driver.  The hope was that if I had a specific mutation, then I could go on a targeted medicine or pill rather than rushing into chemotherapy or radiation treatments.  Targeted treatments have less side effects and do not cause as much damage to the rest of your body and immune system which is very important.Two weeks later my doctor informed me that I was ""fortunate"" they had found a mutation.  I have the EGFR mutation, exon 19. This meant that I could go on Afatinib which is a once a day pill targeted to stop the further spread of cancer for those with this particular mutation.  The problem is that even with this newly approved targeted treatment, it is only effective in about 60% of patients.  Furthermore, studies show that even if effective it will only last about two years or less before your body becomes resistant or the cancer mutates again theoretically rendering this medication useless.  Plus it doesn't necessarily improve your overall chance of long-term survival.  Again this wasn't and isn't okay with me.  So in conjunction with this medicine we started doing a ton of research on other methods I can do to improve my chances of beating this. We found that your diet is extremely important. I have since gone to a 100% organic diet with no dairy, gluten, red meat and almost no sugar.  For those who know me, that was a huge adjustment.  And who knew that eating healthy was so expensive!  I am also taking daily supplements known to be helpful to cancer patients.  But there had to be more out there.  Through further research in cancer articles, studies, survivor videos, documentaries and more, we found that there are other alternative options out there that are completely non-toxic and natural that can be used in combination with your main treatment.  Additionally there are adjustments you can make in your home and every day environment that can be helpful as well.  We hope to eventually add more treatment modalities as we go.A few weeks ago I received promising news after my most recent scan - the tumor in my lung is shrinking and everything I am doing seems to be helping!  I need to continue this progress because I am trying to avoid going on chemotherapy or radiation.  The only problem is that it is very costly for us to maintain my current diet as well as implement all of the changes we would like to make to create an environment and lifestyle that is conducive to healing.  We are a single income family of six people.   Even with a good insurance plan, my medical expenses from all the procedures, scans and bloodwork have started to mount.  In addition, it is not cheap to eat organically.  My goal is to raise $75k which would help cover most of my medical expenses, alternative therapies and supplements, and assist with our ongoing grocery bills. If you are able to help out I would really appreciate it and if you know anyone else who may be interested in helping please feel free to share.  Every little bit counts and my hope is to pay it forward after I get past this by spreading awareness and all the knowledge I have gained along this journey to others who either have or are affected by cancer.  My entire family thanks you from the bottom of our hearts!Mike",dfd265fcf4ab57ac5631d30b4c11c33c,52,0.851152,1080.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

""it's Cancer"".   My mom and sister fell to tears while I gasped for the breath that had been ripped from my chest.  In a matter of seconds I felt my whole world flip upside down and my heart shatter into a million pieces.  On that day I was diagnosed with Squamous Cell Carcinoma that was present in a tumor growth on the right side of my tongue.  I've never felt such a surge of emotions and been more scared of anything in my life before.  All I could think is ""I'm 23 years old, this can't happen to me now..."".  But one thing I knew for sure was that I would not let this monster define me and I sue as hell was not going to let it beat me.  On January 11, 2016 I had surgery to remove the cancer (or so we thought).  I had a partial glossectomy and lymph node dissection (19 total) from my right side of my neck.  All 19 lymph nodes tested negative and we thought we were in the clear.  For the next year I went to my regular checks and still nothing.  I began to feel the fear of my disease begin to fade away and life return to normal.   I reached the year mark and began to believe this was all behind me. Everything changed once again...a lump developed in my right chin that exponentially grew in a matter of two weeks.  On week 3, I had another neck dissection that removed a 4.3 cm tumor that had developed in one of my lymphnodes that had expanded to attach to my muscle in my chin.   Unfortunately, this time around it was not quite as simple removing the cancer with sugery alone and radiation therapy discussions began.  I felt my head spin in disbelief that this monster was not only back but came back with greater force.  My worst fear from the past year of my cancer returning was now a reality-a reality I did not want to accept but had no choice.  Then as I prepared myself for the road of radiation ahead another bump came in the road (well more like a crater).  They found ANOTHER lymphnode in my chest aggressively growing cancer.   AGAIN I felt my world shatter.  This time I lost myself in a fit of rage and tears, losing hope that I will survive.  My cancer is something I am being told is rare in someone this young and spreading at an abnormal rate.  Now I am facing an even greater battle with my life as I will undergo chemotherapy.   They tell me I will face risks to my fertility which broke my heart as I have always wanted nothing more in life than to feel the love and joy of giving life and raising a family.  So I knew despite my crippling financial situation as I am unemployed at this time, I need to secure my dream of my future children.  To do this I am undergoing egg freezing for future use once I am finally healthy and cancer free.   Doing this has begun to give me a peace of mind and a renewed positivity towards my future as I go to war within my own body to defeat this cancer hopefully once and for all.   Unfortunately the fertility and egg freezing are not covered by insurance and over $6,000 for the shots and procedure and one year of storage.  At the same time my insurance coverage for cancer treatments to attend specialized cancer facility is lacking in areas.  I also face the unknown risk of insurance coverages as I am removed from my parent's insurance in just over one year.   All of these costs and unknowns have weighed so heavily upon my shoulders.  At times I have to remind myself that I simply must do what I must to save my life and let the rest come.    I have never been one to really ask for much as I belive that if we work hard, have faith and love deeply we will perservere in the end.  But I am beginning to realize that in order to save my life must now implement these beliefs now more than ever in a slightly different way.  I need to work hard to advocate for awareness of my disease (Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma - Head and Neck Cancer), have faith in God and the compassion of those who surround me to help raise me up when I am weak, and to love deeper for myself, my family, my friends and every deserving creature on this Earth.  Because at the end of each day what do we have if we do not have love?  My love and my faith is what pushes me through this difficult time in my life and I know that I will perservere in the end.  I will never give up.  I will win this fight and I will live my life to the fullest and longest that I can.   They say God only gives the toughest battles to his strongest warriors and I am a Warrior!  Will you please join me in being a warrior too?Love and God Bless,Samantha",8e5ef92a478077916e74c99da8c1723f,60,0.3603,630.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

It’s a rare form of soft tissue cancer in his leg called Myxoid Liposarcoma that is very hard to diagnose. Because of this, the tumor has had time to grow. The surgical team has concluded that in order to remove the entire tumor and ensure that Mikey will live, his left leg must be amputated on October 31st. Furthermore, to ensure that no cancer remains in his body, he will have to have chemotherapy once he recovers from the leg amputation surgery. The amount and intensity of the chemotherapy regimen will depend on just how aggressive the tumor tissue proves to be, which will be determined when the tumor is extracted on the 31st. The oncology team has informed us that Mikey might need inpatient chemotherapy for several months, which will make returning to work difficult if not impossible for an unknown amount of time.It’s a sad and frustrating thing that in this extraordinarily challenging time Mikey and his partner Cj must also contend with the financial reality of these treatments, recovery and adaptation to life after an amputation.

I am currently stage 2.Since being diagnosed, I have undergone a body scan, a laparoscopy,  a colonoscopy and more blood work than I've ever had in my life. On February 5th, I will undergo a Radical Hysterectomy. They will be removing my cervix,  my ovaries, my uterus, my tubes, lymph nodes and hopefully all of the cancer. This then requires a 2-4 day hospital stay followed by a 2 month recovery process which will keep me out of work. The hope is that after this- I will be cancer free and additional treatment will not be required. Cancer is expensive.  I am blessed to have wonderful boss allowing me to cash in my vacation time and sick leave,  but even with a great restaurant job and  a pretty decent health care package, I am crippled by its financial burden. The two-month recovery process is expensive as well and the bills do not stop.I want you to all know that any contributions to helping me pay my hospital bills and supporting my recovery are so appreciated.  I have set up billing with NYU Perlmutter Cancer Center to start after the surgery, so I can try to keep a clear mind through this. Anyone who knows me knows I am a fighter. I have lost a few great friends to this disease so this fight, my fight, is dedicated to them. Should you have any additional questions please feel free to reach out to me.

Lee was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer with liver metastasis in September 2017.  He began chemotherapy treatment in November of that year, after recovering from two emergency surgeries (one to remove part of his colon and another to place a stent in his artery to alleviate edema to his legs) and a paracentesis, a procedure that drained excess fluids in his abdomen caused by his diseased liver.  John responded well to the chemo treatments and was able to return to work in March 2018.  He would continue to receive chemo every other week to keep the cancer in check.  In December 2018, John received frightening news that the different treatments that he has been taking are no longer effective in controlling the cancer.  He was given Mitomycin-C by his oncologist as a third-line treatment on January 2nd, 2019.  A week later, his belly had grown so big that he had to go to the hospital to have a paracentesis procedure to remove the ascites built up in his abdomen.  The hospital staff removed 5.5 Liters of fluid from his body.  He went home the next day but developed a fever the day after.  He went back to the hospital on January 11th 2019 and has not returned home since.    Over the next few days, his appetite decreased drastically and the severity of pain he felt increased.  He is normally a person with high pain tolerance and his facial expressions indicated he was suffering.  When he could no longer tolerate the pain, he asked for hydromorphone.  While the medication relieved some of his pain, it also gave him many side effects, including drowsiness, nausea, headaches, and difficulty in using the bathroom.  A second paracentesis was performed on him and this time over 7 Liters of fluid was drained from him.  A Tenckhoff catherer was put into his abdominal area so that future drainage could be done at his bedside.  Three bedside drainage have been done so far, draining 300ml, 600ml, and 975ml respectively, with future drainage to be done every other day.   John's health continued to worsen during his stay at the hospital.  Then on January 16th, two weeks after his latest chemo treatment, doctors from the hospital and the cancer treatment center had a meeting with John and his family to discuss his condition and treatment options he should consider.  He was told that due to the aggressiveness of his cancer, his prognosis was very bad and he has at most 6 months to live.  He had two options: A) stop cancer treatment and focus on hospice care that would manage his symptoms and provide comfort for the remainder of his life or B) go to rehab,  attempt to overcome the symptoms caused by the cancer, regain his strength, and maybe try Mitomycin again or Oxaliplantin that gave him a bad reaction before.  The chances of succeeding are very very slim to none and the possible risks and side effects could outweigh the benefits.  John, being the fighter that he is, chose to go to a rehabilitation center to continue his battle with cancer.  Myself, my two other siblings, and his wife are fully supportive of his decision, and will stay by his side day and night to provide care for him in this fight for his life.John Lee is a very altruistic person and he loves to help people any way he can.  After college, he worked as a social worker for some time for the Chinese American Planning Council and provided services to new immigrants to overcome language barriers they faced in their adopted country.  After becoming a father of two special needs children, he left a good paying corporate job and went back to school to become a Speech Language Pathologist to help his own children as well as others in the special needs community.   He is an advocate for kids with special needs and often tries to educate the public about Autism Spectrum Disorder.  At church, he was involved in ESL teachers training and special needs children Sunday School.  He became very involved in his cancer support community by serving in its Participant Advisory Council and helping with fundraising efforts.  He has a big heart, a generous personality, and has made a difference in the lives of many people.  He is filled with love, hope, faith, and strength.  Read More About John Here John and his family really need your help.  John's wife Sharon is taking an unpaid leave from work to care for John and their kids.  They currently don't have any income.  The money raised from this campaign will help with their living expenses, existing and future medical bills, other future costs as a result of this disease, and funding for special needs trusts set up for their children.  Please contribute if you can.  No amount is too small.  Thank you very much.(Photo taken August 27, 2017 -

They are apart of the Lineman Brotherhood family. The main goal here is to raise awareness about this rare cancer and help raise money for  medical expenses during Stetson's journey. Any leftover contributions will be strictly donated to research for MRT, or to another family suffering from MRT. Stetson Garwood was born on June 6th, 2017. At just 19 months old, Stetson was diagnosed with a malignant  rhabdoid tumor. This aggressive tumor is found mostly in young children. Only 20-25 cases are reported each year. There is a one in three survival rate (33%).  This tumor attacks soft tissue in the body mostly found in the kidneys, liver, brain and lungs.  Stetson is currently stage 3. The tumor was on his left kidney and has since been removed along with surrounding lymph nodes.  Stetson is starting his 8 month journey of chemo. He will receive 8 cycles of chemo that will insert six new chemicals into his body. In between his first and second cycle of chemo, Stetson will undergo eleven days of radiation. The radiation will be introduced to the site where the tumor was found. He must have radiation between his first and second cycle because the chemicals that will be introduced during the second cycle can have a dangerous reaction with radiation. Due to the chemo and radiation, he will most likely need a blood transfusion after every other cycle of chemo. He may need more depending on his white blood cell count. Stetson will have internal scarring and also lose inches of his height due to the kidney radiation being close his spine. Stetson will also be put under for a CT scan and and MRI after each cycle of chemo to ensure no other tumors have formed . Even if Stetson has a cancer free screening in 8 months, there's still a 90% chance it will return.The Garwood family is from Bargersville, Indiana. Garrett, 28, has been a lineman since 2014. He has been a journeyman since March of 2018. Garrett has worked for Duke Energy, ARC, Service Electric and is currently working for Hydaker Wheatlake.  Ashley, 25, is in the medical field and grew up in Plainfield, IN. During such a difficult time, The Garwood's are also expecting their second boy. Beau Gannon Garwood due date is July 28th, 2019. This cancer may be hereditary. The Garwood's are waiting for genetic testing to see if their unborn baby tests positive. If the tests come back positive, there's a 50/50 chance the baby will go through similar hardships as Stetson. Stetson is so adventurous and loves to run around and play. He also loves paw patrol! As Ryder says on the show, ""No job is too big, no pup is too small!"" We believe with the love and support of the Lineman brotherhood and others, we can raise enough money for Stetson's medical expenses. All leftover contributions will be strictly donated to research for MRT or another family suffering from MRT. Please consider a donation of any amount to our dear friend Garrett and his family during this difficult time. The Garwood's  want to thank everyone for the prayers and support in their time of need.

In early 2017 Sean was diagnosed with liposarcoma, a rare type of cancer that affects the body's connective tissues. He required 10 hours of surgery to remove a massive tumour from his abdomen. The radiation took a toll on Sean and the fight was difficult, but he battled back and pulled through. Recovery was a long, tough road, but thankfully, in March 2018, a follow up scan gave us much relief when the results came back clear. Sadly just months after this clear scan, in October 2018, we were thrown back into the ring to ‘fight’ again. We learned that the cancer had come back, this time packing an even stronger and more aggressive punch. Sean is now undergoing multiple chemotherapy treatments in order to stop the disease from spreading. While the outlook remains grim, we continue to fight for the sake of our family and truly thank everyone for sending us your thoughts & prayers. The challenge ahead2019 will be a particularly difficult year us and we’re hoping you can help offset some of the intense financial pressures experienced by Sean and our family.  The medications required and the cost of the treatments are extremely expensive and Sean's private insurance is already maxed out.

Urgent Care quickly sent Jesse to the emergency room at Jamestown UPMC where he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, Ketoacidosis, AFib, and Sepsis. After attempting to drain a buildup of fluid under Jesse's right pectoral muscle, the doctors at Jamestown UPMC determined that Jesse's condition was much more severe than originally thought, and as such he was transferred to UPMC Hamot that night to undergo emergency surgery. Once the thoracic surgeon at Hamot opened Jesse up, it was discovered that he had Necrotising Fasciitis. After two surgery's to peel away the dead flesh, another surgery to close the wound, and then a week spent at a rehabilitation center, Jesse was finally able to come home.For the first couple of weeks following Jesse's return home, it seemed as if he was recovering well from his ordeal with Necrotising Fasciitis. He was able to get his surgery drainage tubes removed, he was able to walk with the assistance of a cane, and he was able to return to teaching. Unfortunately however, this upturn in Jesse's health did not last long. Jesse's energy levels began to seriously decline and his pain level was drastically increasing. After a trip to his Primary Care Physician, it was discovered that Jesse's incision from his surgery had become infected by two separate bacteria. Jesse was prescribed two antibiotics and was sent home with the hope that this would allow Jesse to finally heal. Unfortunately, this was not the case. On December 26th, Jesse made the decision to call an ambulance to transport him back to Jamestown UPMC. At this point, Jesse was in so much pain that he was unable to stand or walk, so driving himself to the hospital was not an option. While at Jamestown UPCM, X-rays revealed that Jesse has severe bone deterioration, including a broken shoulder, a broken rib, and possible multiple broken vertebrae. Due to the extent of the bone deterioration, Jesse was transferred back to UPMC Hamot. The following morning, Jesse was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer that has spread into his bones. Since his cancer diagnosis, Jesse has had two surgeries; the first was completed at UPMC Hamot, which placed a rod in his right femur in order to stabilize the bone and prevent it from breaking. The second surgery was completed at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center and involved the reconstruction of his right humerus bone. Due to his lack of mobility and extreme pain levels, Jesse has been unable to return home since he left on December 26th. After doing biopsies of Jesse's cancer, it was determined that the specific type of breast cancer that he has is both estrogen receptor positive (ER Positive) and progesterone receptor positive (PR Positive). This was great news because it meant that Jesse's cancer could be treated with hormonal therapy. Jesse is currently in a rehabilitation center, where he is recovering from his shoulder and leg surgeries. Once he reaches the point where he has regained his mobility, he will meet with an oncologist to discuss the possibility of supplementing the hormonal treatment that he is already on with radiation therapy. Because male breast cancer is so rare (less than 1% of all breast cancers occur in men), it is difficult to get a concrete outlook/prognosis. However, we do know that the specific type of breast cancer that Jesse has is the most treatable and has the highest survival rates. In Jesse's own words, he plans to ""CRUSH THIS""!Any financial support that can be provided to Jesse and his wife, Donna throughout his treatment and recovery would be much appreciated and lift a burden off of their shoulders!",59d89aea4b4988305eb2f1f3bdf341e7,26,0.4645,1.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

She tested positive for the BRCA 1 gene. (SIDE NOTE: If you have a family history of breast cancer, I would highly recommend you run and have this test done.) As a family, we prefer to be very private about this sort of thing. After being diagnosed and undergoing many tests, Marnie underwent an intense 20 weeks of chemo therapy.  Thankfully, she had a successful bi-lateral mastectomy this past holiday season. Prayers were answered, and both lymph nodes and pathology are clear. We are beyond grateful that she is currently cancer free. That said, this is the beginning of an ongoing journey for those that understand the BRCA1 mutation. Marnie has been unable to work since May 2018. She is a behavior therapist, specializing in working with children with autism. By the time she is able to go back to work, it will be just over a full year. These donations will pay back money that helped cover expenses incurred over the past year including lost income, her upcoming breast reconstruction surgery, travel, lodging, and other everyday living costs while she finishes the next 6 months of fighting this process. A large portion of your generous donations will be used to pay back debt that she has acquired due to loss of income. The remaining portion will be to cover specific costs associated with consultations, fertility treatments, and all out of pocket expenses which her insurance did not cover. Early on, her plan did not cover all consultations needed to get treatment started. So she had to pay out of pocket for the majority of her appointments. And as an otherwise very healthy, young woman of 32 with a committed partner; fertility was always a high priority on the list behind her cancer treatment plan. In efforts to make sure she can have a family of her own after all of this, she had to put funds into fertility testing and treatments to help give her and her partner their best chances. Looking to the past, it will help pay back a lot of this debt. But looking forward, it will help her begin her next chapter without additional financial stress.Thanks & Appreciation!",277a6902ae63146f5cee45afd6261dc4,24,0.3324,1.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Cancer won and battle but our love will win the war for this young family. Karun was blessed with  2 sweet kids, daughter (Gauri Batra, 8 years), son (Shoreya Batra, 4 years) and wife (Meenakshi Batra) . Karun, a doting father carved out a niche to make sure that he provided the best life for his kids in his best capacity. He was happily living with his family till Jan, 2018 when they came to know that Karun was diagnosed with a very rare, very aggressive, and very advanced (stage 4) form of blood cancer. Despite the financial hardships ,   Karun’s family didn’t lose hope and admitted him to best hospital of the city hoping he will get cured. The fighter Karun was, he fought with blood cancer for a year. After the initial chemotherapy sessions, doctors recommended Bone Marrow transplant, lot of tests & samples were done and Karun’s brave 8 year old daughter matched the bone marrow and came forward to save her father's life to donate her bone marrow.The cancer was very aggressive &  during the Bone Marrow transplant Karun developed a clot in the brain Karun went into coma.  Doctors put him on a ventilator, but he started sinking.  This Go Fund Me page is set up to  help offset the astronomical medical costs and to help out this young family in educating the kids and living expenses.   We are optimistic &  have set the  goal to $50,000 USD, if we exceed the goal, we will donate the funds to cancer research and patients who need funds for treatment.

Please share with all your loved ones.A message from Matthew Sun’s wife, Kate:Only 10 days ago, we thought we had a full life ahead of us - we had all the time in the world. Matt was working as a teacher at Fraser Academy and we enjoyed our active and healthy life together with our little dog, Scully. In the middle of the night last week we rushed Matt to the hospital with suspected appendicitis. Only 24 hours later we are faced with a diagnosis that floored even our doctors, given that Matt is an active and health-conscious 32-year-old: stage 4 cancer had metastasized into several organs unbeknownst to us. In the words of the doctors, “treatment will slow down the disease, but to be brutally honest, the cancer will kill you.” The last days have been a whirlwind. With the help of our friends, to whom we are eternally grateful, we were able to get married 2 days after Matt's diagnosis - borrowed wedding dress and all. Matt is now recovering from surgery to remove a tumor and will start chemotherapy in 4 weeks, with treatment bi-monthly. We know Matt is a fighter and will give it his all to hold the cancer at bay as long as possible. The most current prognosis is that, with a little luck, the chemo will work well enough to give Matt a few more months or even a year or so of good life. In the midst of devastation, we are determined to pack as much life as possible into the time that Matt has left. Matt has always been kind-hearted and optimistic, and has many things he loves. We want him to enjoy them.For a while now, we have been dreaming about a little camper Van. We thought we would get one after I graduate (I am a PhD student), but now there is no time like the present. A camper van would allow us to travel in between chemo cycles and go places we want to visit as a family. Matt is especially excited about going to Tofino and seeing El Capitan in Yosemite National Park.  The funds raised will help:• cut back on work to take better care of Matthew• support travel and accommodation while attending clinical trials to help Matthew fight cancer as long as we can• make small alterations to our apartment as needed (e.g. railings in the bathroom) that will enable Matthew to be at home more easily• pay for supplemental treatments not covered my MSP",25d9d38b22b1fc5de311f79a7f2ab595,18,0.3778,7.0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Jonathan is a Deputy Sheriff for the Los Angeles Sheriff Department and was on patrol the day he started complaining about sharp pains coming from the side of his belly. Many of us played doctor with what could be wrong with him telling him it was probably nothing serious. In typical Jonathan fashion, he tried to push through the pain, but it was so severe that he went to urgent care to get it checked out.  Given the location of his pain, he was told that he might have gallstones and that they needed to perform an ultrasound to be sure. The ultrasound revealed no gallstones, but several masses on his liver. Without jumping to conclusions, he was scheduled for a biopsy about a month away. Not even two weeks had passed before he couldn't take the pain and fatigue any longer and went to the Emergency Department. It was then that an emergency biopsy and full body CT scan were performed. Not much else was told to my brother but he was given a referral to see an oncologist on 11/8/18. Although Jonathan and all of our family remained optimistic, anxiety was through the roof as his oncology appointment to confirm his diagnosis was still a couple weeks away. A few days later, my brother received a phone call from Kaiser and was told that the sample from the biopsy was confirmed to be a cancerous tumor. He was diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon Cancer with metastases (spread) to the liver. The liver having several tumors.We were all in shock and disbelief. Cancer again?!?! We lost our grandfather and two uncles from cancer all within a few years from each other. This news tore us at our core.  But now, to learn that my baby brother, at only 27 years of age with a beautiful 1 year old daughter, had just received such an unexpected diagnosis was devastating.  He was just settling in to his adult life with a loving wife, a new starter home, and a career as a deputy sheriff that he was so excited about. Why him!? Why now!? Google quickly became my best friend as I did all the research I could. To my surprise, colon cancer doesn’t only happen to men over 50.  The more I read, the more I learned about how this disease takes lives so damn often no matter what age. With more knowledge about this disease, our family came closer together and didn't think twice about our mission to help my brother fight this horrible disease.On 11/12/18, my brother went to his chemotherapy orientation at Kaiser and was given information on what to expect from chemotherapy and how to best deal with the side effects. He was told that the nausea, vomiting, and fatigue he had already been experiencing would increase with chemotherapy.""Nothing but the best"" is what our unified motto was. So even though he had health insurance through Kaiser, he scheduled a consultation for a second opinion with a well know cancer hospital called City of Hope. On 11/15/18, Jonathan met with an oncologist at City of Hope and was very pleased with him, the staff, and the facility in Duarte.  They gave him a breakdown of how they would treat him if he chose to get treatment there. It was almost a no brainer that he needed to be there ASAP. He immediately submitted a request to switch his health insurance to begin treatment at City of Hope for better care. My brother decided to start with his first round of chemotherapy via IV at Kaiser on 11/20/18 in order to not delay his treatment. He seemed fine until about 48 hours later when the nausea and fatigue set into high gear and all he wanted to do was rest. Then on 11/23/18, he underwent surgery to have a port placed to better receive the chemotherapy drugs. Fatigue, constant nausea, surgery, stress, fear of the unknown, worried about work, maintaining a family, keeping a wife happy, and maintaining a positive outlook is a true test of willpower and self discipline and focus. But as expected, my brother is pushing through and fighting this to the best of his ability. He is a fighter, always has been!Cancer doesn’t only test a person’s physical health, emotional strength and the bond of one’s relationships.  It is a vicious disease that infiltrates every facet of a person’s life.  While we are all ready to help Jonathan fight this head-on, we anticipate huge financial stress with a decrease of pay due to loss of overtime opportunities, hospital copays and coinsurance fees, consultation expenses, increased insurance premiums, specialty medications, external care, family needs and upkeep. The goal is to beat cancer! But until we get there, I am humbly asking you to help my brother in any amount you can so that he and his wife can focus all of their attention and efforts to their fight against cancer. Please know that any help will forever be appreciated.Jonathan. We will never stop fighting for you, we will never give up, you are not alone.Your brother,Jorge Torres Jr",869630a7341f715799cde94200c63a5a,44,0.495,60.0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

She has left a positive mark on anybody who has had the privilege of having her in their life. She is incredibly independent and always has more to give to others, even if this means making sacrifices. She pursued a career as an advertising executive and later became a full-time mother when she had us. Although this was a difficult decision, she was incredibly loving and made a tremendous impact on our lives as she raised us. She was heavily involved in the community as well, most notably singing every Sunday morning in the St. Bede’s Choir; she was also, fundraising and chairing events in support of various institutions. Whether it was in our school or in our community, our mother always made it a point to be involved.Our mom’s life changed drastically through a divorce; only proving her resilience in character and determination as a mother. When she was forced back to work in an industry that had gone digital in her absence (advertising), she was nothing but a prime example of strength. Working freelance for agencies and learning day-by-day about the changed profession that she left 20 years ago to raise her kids. When life threw us curveballs, she handled them like a champ.The past year has been incredibly hard for us. After a series of misdiagnoses and altogether switching to a different hospital, it was found that our mother has Pancreatic Cancer. Due to its advanced stages, she is participating in treatments at UCLA that will hopefully bring positive results.She is lucky to be in a great facility, but unfortunately this does not come without a price. As we all know, getting sick can be very expensive. Unexpected costs present themselves everyday: whether it’s copayments, deductibles or the cost of basic necessities. This will also include finding mom a place to live (but not without the family dog, Buttons)! As her kids, we are doing everything we can to support her through this process but we cannot do it alone. Because of her health, Anita has not been able to work in the past year and does not qualify for government help. On top of this, we lack the financial help from extended family.

Gina is fiercely independent and has always put her rescue before herself time and time again. This time will be no different even though she tries to assure us she will put herself first. For anyone that knows Gina, knows this is impossible and the reason we love her so damn much as well as wanting to tear our hair out.We know Gina needs support now more than ever. Gina had a huge health scare just over two years ago. She battled it quietly and didn't want to draw attention to her battle. Still rescuing and thinking of the dogs that needed her as she sat in hospital recovering.This time will be no different except for this. Gina has gone without time and time again because she puts her all into her beloved rescue and the dogs. She has gone without food or her own medication at times because she always puts animals and other people first. Gina has sold almost everything she owns just so that animals are given a chance where others would just discard them. Gina is always the first to help others in crisis and we feel it is most definitely the time that we all pitch in to help Gina at the time she needs it the most.Gina doesn't do it for the attention or for praise. It us just who Gina is intrinsically. No one can fake the dedication she has. It is part of her soul. This new battle ahead will see her do the same. It is who Gina is and she cannot be stopped! Her closest friends know she says she will try to concentrate on herself first but we know Gina too well. Even as Gina comes to terms with what lays ahead, instead of sitting still she is filling in time working on helping the old neglected dogs. Gina doesn't want a fuss or attention but I feel like we can't let Gina hide and say she is fine while she struggles. Whether we raise a dollar or $1000 this money is for Gina and/or her family to use as they see fit. For medications, for specialist appointments, for petrol to get to appointments, for an air conditioner, for a bill or two, just anything at all. Just something to take away some financial stress that this cancer journey is going to bring with it. This is for Gina, this is not rescue, this is not for anyone but Gina and/or her family. We believe in Gina's ability to beat cancer but nobody can deny that the ride is going to be very tough at times. We just want to make it a little easier and a lot more comfortable where we can.Her dear friend Tony sent Gina this song to her yesterday. The people who have struggled through this journey themselves talk of not having to do it alone and how they needed support. I ask you to watch it. It is going to take a lot to get through this and Gina deserves to not have to fight this alone, quietly or dismiss her own health because she doesn't want to create a fuss. https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=PLJK99w6I2oIGC20kT2BiwRXvGd8m73ReU&v=ZYNOXRifXKQMartina McBride - I'm Gonna Love You Through ItBest of martinamcbride:  https://goo.gl/VmN7Gw Subscribe here:  https://goo.gl/mRaS2v Music video by Martina McBride performing I'm Gonna Love You Through It. ...youtube.com",65aa962182b1b91022229ab23d9bbf14,30,0.808,0.875,4,0,0,5,2,4,1,0.008417508417508417,0.003367003367003367,0.15781049935979513,8.459024130381902,2.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

Brian was diagnosed with appendix cancer a little over five years ago when his appendix suddenly burst. Due to his appendix bursting the cancer spread to his peritoneum.  The peritoneum is a lining on the inside of the abdomen and on the outside of organs like the intestines and liver.  Since then he has had to endure numerous surgeries, two HIPEC surgeries (heated chemo bath that is delivered to your abdomen and soaks for up to 14 hours while patient is cut open) and 74 rounds of chemotherapy.  Not only does this amazing person not complain, he always manages to go to work, help his kids with homework and attend all three of his kid’s soccer games.  Traveling soccer entails up to 8 games a weekend in different parts of the state and out of state and it is something that he loves to do… spending time with his family. With everything Brian is going through he always makes everyone around him a priority.  If he knows you need help with something, he is the first person to jump in and offer help.  He is the most inspiring person you could ever meet, and has truly earned his nickname, Superman!The medical bills Brian has had throughout these past 5 years are crazy.  Nobody going through this should even have to think about that while fighting for his life.  We are all hoping and praying for a miracle to eradicate the cancer.  Please help reduce some of the burden on this wonderful family that is in this most unfortunate of circumstances.",bb6b64b15934960cf2fe7b7525c7ca18,15,0.1062,1.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I know it's hard to be in someone else's shoes. How would you tell your children who have lived in a constant state of crisis that this is it? That dad is sick, again. We have been running and fighting a war since this began 5 years ago. Our resources are depleted and our options are nearly exhausted. I know we are not alone. I know we are not the first, or the last. I feel like we are facing the beginning of the end and my resilient heart is broken. Today (11/14/18) doctors found that Justin does in fact have two large masses in his lung. The professional from UC Davis giving this news had to step out of the room to compose himself. One is the size of a baseball and the other a golf ball. It is stage 4. It is not operable. There are 3 options... One clinical trial with the drug he was taking a few months ago but in a new way. The other treatment option is one that has already destroyed so much of Justin's body and will most likely buy time but not change the inevitable. I know we have asked for help before and I know that right now there is not enough to go around. The last is a ground floor trial with no information related to risks, etc. What I dont know is how we are going to make it from here. We dont have money for the treatment copays and many appointments we are about to face. Justin has to go to Davis every 2 weeks for infusions. What about end of life expenses? Our credit is gone after mounds of medical expenses. I cant imagine a world where my children will not have their father. I want to scream and cry. I want to fight but I cant. I want to fix this but it's not up to me, or Justin. So our family is asking for help. Help to pay medical expenses, help to keep some normalcy for our boys, help with the inevitable. Please donate if you can and share. If you cant donate start a team at work to raise money.

She underwent a very risky operation to remove a brain tumor the size of a golf ball that had encased itself around the carotid artery and optic nerve.

As difficult as it is for me to ask for help, let alone talk about my health, the fact is that I need all the support you have to offer.After two biopsies, I was diagnosed with Stage II Triple-Negative breast cancer in July, 2018, and underwent a partial mastectomy in late September of last year. I consulted with my oncologist at that time to explore my treatment options. It is important to explain that while I am a very healthy person with an active lifestyle, my Congenital Muscular Dystrophy(CMD) and related medical conditions are major factors in any medical treatment I receive. My oncologist informed me that I am not a candidate for standard radiation therapy. I am also not a candidate for the only recommended treatment of chemotherapy because my type of cancer requires the most aggressive form of chemo. The chemo itself would likely cause permanent damage to my heart and body. My mastectomy resulted in me being identified as cancer free, and I returned to my everyday life with the looming prospect of cancer recurrence due to no precautionary treatment.My second breast tumor was diagnosed on January 8, 2019. The Triple-Negative tumor sits just along my surgery scar and returned in only three months. My surgeon recommended removing the second tumor, but is concerned about compromising the integrity of the underlying tissue because he already removed so much. The surgery could result in an open wound and/or me being unable to sit up again. The “treatment plan” accepted by my current oncology team is to not treat me at all. I will not accept having pieces of me picked off until there is nothing else to pick. That is not acceptable!Research has led me to a facility that specializes in immunotherapy, treating aggressive and late-stage cancers. The treatment attacks the tumor directly by triggering the immune system instead of poisoning the entire body with chemo. An individualized cancer vaccine also helps to prep the immune system to respond to future recurrences. The immunotherapy has few potential side effects and improved recurrence stats. Best of all, it offers hope in place of impending doom! I can accept hope!This is where I need you so much: the entire immunotherapy treatment is out-of-pocket. The facility is in Tijuana, Mexico, and I will have to stay there for two weeks. My incredibly supportive family is doing everything they can to cover my upfront medical costs, but they will be stretched to the limit. Another issue is that since I won’t be able to rely on my usual in-home nursing care in Mexico, I need to secure caregivers with a private agreement. Please help me lift the burden off my loved ones. We all need to focus on my treatment right now, and I can’t do that until I know that the needs of my loved ones are being accounted for in some way. Upfront Treatment costs include:Immunotherapy $35,000Lodging $1,40024-hour Personal Caregivers $1,500Food and Travel $100I expect to proceed with immunotherapy within the next 14 days, and payment is due in full at that time. Thank you for reading this. You cannot know just how much I appreciate your generosity. This pursuit of treatment is my demand for hope.

It’s a rare brain tumor, uncommon in young females especially. Mariam only 16 at the time, came home from a school dance just over a year ago on Oct. 15 and woke up the next morning in a seizure. She was immediately rushed to the hospital to find out that she had stage 3/4 brain cancer. She’s   a normal, healthy teenager who loves spending time with friends, family and loves to go shopping. She never had a symptom prior to her diagnosis. Mariam went this last year through bouts of chemo and radiation always in good spirits and optimistic. Just as we were planning a big birthday for her in August, and even feeling weak she was so excited for her birthday. Than Unexpectedly, she had a seizure that same weekend and never got to enjoy what might be her last birthday. Mariam ended up having to go into surgery in order to have a shunt placed in her skull to help relieve the pressure from the tumor. She came out of it her happy self always smiling and laughing with her soft respectful voice. She continued to tell her family and friends not to worry once she’s better she’ll visit everyone. Always so strong and optimistic. Unfortunately, around October of this last year she got an infection in her shunt, which could be fatal itself. Since then, slowly she’s been through a really tough time. Mariams no longer mobile and takes full time attention from her parents and 3 other siblings.

After a few weeks of hoping he would snap out of what we all thought was just a funk, we started to get concerned and took him to the ER. Mind you he is a 51 year old man who never had a reason to go to the doctor, never had any medical problems, & rarely ever even got the common head cold. So to say we were shocked and panicked when the doctor told us that the CT of his brain showed a large mass, is a complete understatement. All of our lives were flipped upside down and my Father was immediately transferred to a different hospital. There, he was admitted for 3 weeks as he underwent brain surgery by two top neurosurgeons to remove as much of the tumor as possible. After surgery, my Dad then went through intense physical and speech rehabilitation, as he now suffers from a disorder called Aphasia which affects a persons ability to communicate and successfully care for himself.When the surgical pathology results came back, what we feared most became reality, that the tumor was in fact a glioblastoma; the deadliest form of brain cancer currently without a known cure.Fast forward to today; my Dad needs 24/7 caregivers here at home. He cannot work, drive, or be on his own. We’ve been through countless doctors appointments, imaging / blood tests, daily speech therapy,  6 straight weeks of radiation treatment, and he’s now on his second round of chemotherapy. My father still is not and may never be the same happy, funny, chill person he once was.

After an CT Scan, they learned she had a brain tumor that required immediate surgery. She was brought by ambulance to Fargo, ND where she had surgery. There they learned that Emily had a medulla blastoma (brain cancer). This new knowledge eventually lead Emily and Nate to Illinois. There they were closer to her family and a great team of doctors in Chicago. After a series of chemo and radiation Emily went into a monitoring phase for the next five years. During that time, they moved to North Dakota and were blessed with a baby girl. After a few years, they moved back to Illinois and found out they were pregnant again. Towards the end of Emily's second pregnancy (in 2016) they found out she had a new tumor growing. After surgery to remove the tumor, it was determined that she had a secondary cancer. This time she was diagnosed with osteosarcoma (bone cancer). Chemotherapy followed the surgery that removed the tumor. Since that tumor removal in 2016, Emily has had new growths, a surgery, and ongoing treatments. Her most recent surgery was in the spring of 2018. Since then, a new growth had started and her doctors recommended Chemotherapy before anymore surgery. Emily is currently going through these treatments. Emily is a light for Jesus and knows that no matter what she is going through that #Godisstronger. All funds raised through this campaign will go directly to Emily and her family to help offset medical costs and pay for travel expenses to and from treatments.

He went through grueling rounds of chemotherapy, surgeries, and a stem cell transplant. In June of 2017 he was cleared of cancer. Then in July he went for a routine check up and a swollen lymph node was discovered. Scans were done once more and Oakley's parents were given the devasting news once again that their now 3 year old son had cancer! The Neuroblastoma had relapsed! Oakley's plan of treatment is to travel to Philadelphia and fight the cancer through injections that will make him radioactive for 2-5 days following the injection, but will destroy the cancer in him.

We were happy as a family.  But those times didn’t last long because in 2016 my breast cancer Metastisized to my bones.  It fractured two vertebrae in my neck and there were spots down my spine and on my ribs.  This was devastating news because my cancer now became a Stage 4 (terminal) cancer.  However, I have too much to live for to allow this cancer to get to me.  I have had multiple radiation treatments to several areas of my body and have been going through chemo treatments weekly since my new diagnosis.  These treatments will continue for the rest of my life and are very expensive.  Already this year I have a new medical bill for several thousand dollars.  Life has changed for my family again and I just want my girls and my husband to be happy and not have to worry about money.  My husband has a great job and works very hard but as a result, we are not eligible for any financial assistance.  My family has been through so much and they support me daily. I just need to know that they are going to be ok down the road. How can I know that if I can’t ensure that now? I worry all day about money and often I am up through the night wondering how we are going to pay the bills. I should be focusing on fighting this cancer so I can continue to be here for my family.  That is much harder to do when I find myself always thinking about money and worrying... As it is, this year, expenses have increased but our income has decreased slightly due to the need for additional health insurance for me.  The constant worry is really starting to get to me.  So far, we have to be able to give our children the life that they deserve to have and I don’t want them to feel the daily worry that I have or have to sacrifice more than they already have had to do, on so many levels.  Please understand that I am grateful for everything I have and for everyone in my life and nothing will ever change that!!All along we have been doing everything we could do to keep up with the all the medical bills, personal bills and expenses and provide for our girls but the bills and expenses are becoming too much. I have always been one not to ask for help but when talking to a friend the other day, she said, “Michele, it can’t hurt to ask for help. You will never know if you don’t ask and you don’t need the added financial stress!” I thought about it and she is right. The constant worry and wonder is starting to get to me and the one thing that I do know is that this kind of stress can cause my cancer to have more power. I can’t allow that....All I want is to wake up one day without needing to figure out where the money is going to come from when my daughter asks me to get her something at the grocery store or when the request comes from school for the need to buy a ticket for a field trip.  I want to enjoy life, not take the motions to go through life.  That is what I do now and life (especially mine) is way too short for that.  The amount of worry is too great and I honestly don’t know how to fix things without asking for help.  So, Please, if it won’t hurt you to help my family, we would appreciate anything that you might be able to do to help us.  Even if it is just a $1.00 that you can spare or maybe you would be willing to share my link with your friends and family on social media, All of the above would help.  The more eyes that see my post the more of a chance I have to get back on my feet.

Following that appointment, Anna has undergone multiple medical appointments, CT Scans, PET scans and surgeries, unfortunately confirming cancer - Stage 2 Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Although the 5 year survival rate for stage 2 Hodgkin’s Lymphoma is about 90%, Anna still has a long road ahead of her to fight this battle. Anna’s chemo treatments began in November. Since then, she has had an excellent response to the treatment. However, cancer activity still remains in her anterior chest and left neck, resulting in the need for additional chemo treatments until Mid-February 2019. She will then have another PET scan to determine if more chemo or possible radiation is needed.Anna continues to fight this battle head on, with an amazing positive attitude, regardless of the side effects she is experiencing from the chemo treatment. She is a senior at St. Scholastica and determined to graduate in May. Her positive attitude and determination has played a role in her ability to continue school throughout her treatment, even when not feeling well. Upon graduation, Anna plans to apply to graduate school in the Fall, again showing how determined and strong she is!Anna has medical insurance but everything is not covered. She has deductibles, copays, and other miscellaneous out-of-pocket medical expenses. Anna’s parents, Chris & Laura, will continue to ensure that Anna is receiving the treatment she needs, regardless of cost. Many wonderful friends and family members have come forward asking how they can help. Our goal is to provide some financial support to help defray some of the expenses.

They did it because they care and genuinely love to help others.Last month my dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We were leaving the hospital after meeting my sweet little niece, and I just so happened to ask how his Dr.’s appointment went. He looked at me with tears in his eyes and said they think it’s cancer.

Instantly, our whole families life flipped upside down. After weeks of feeling very ill, tests, and appointments, he finally gets to start chemo today.

This capped a holiday season where she was already grieving the loss of her father due to illness shortly before Thanksgiving.Erica is the oldest of two girls, a graduate of the College of New Jersey, and works two jobs -- one as a Phys Ed. teacher at Melvin H.

My first deployment was in support of Operation Southern Watch and Operation Desert Fox.  My second deployment was in support of Operation Enduring Freedom after the twin towers fell on 9/11/01.  After I was honorably discharged from the Navy, I felt a duty and calling to fight in the global war on terrorism.  I joined the Marine Corps Reserve for six years as an 0311 rifleman.  I was attached to 1st Battalion 23rd Marines Bravo Company, the ""Battlin' Bastards"".  My unit was activated to go to Iraq as I finished up my basic training (Parris Island) and SOI (School of Infantry).  I was deployed to Iraq in 2004-05 in support of the Global War on Terrorism and Operation Iraqi Freedom II. In November 2004, I was able to participate in Operation Phantom Fury which was the 2nd battle to take the city of Fallujah, Iraq. Now to my current story.  I started to experience some rectal bleeding and complications this past summer.  Being a hard head, I put off these symptoms until late November and had a colonoscopy.  After the colonoscopy, the Dr confirmed via biopsy that I have colorectal cancer.  This was hard news to swallow, but it can be cured with chemo/radiation and surgery.  Well, this is where things went from bad to worse.  Once I had my MRI/CT Scan performed I found out that the cancer has spread to my liver.  My liver is oversized because I have multiple masses in both my left and right lobes.  Unfortunately with this new information it means I have Stage 4, Metastatic cancer. The cancer is not curable, but it is treatable right now.  Because there were so many masses in my liver, surgery is out of the question.  I can't have a  liver transplant  due to fact that I am too high risk of the cancer coming back.  The only course of action is to attack this cancer with chemotherapy.  Now to my plan of action and why I am raising funds.  I had my chemo port installed today and my first chemo treatment is scheduled for January 2, 2019. I will do 6 months of chemo and then I will need a new set of scans to see if the chemo made the masses shrink.  We will reassess after 6 treatments.  Financially speaking, these chemo treatments are quite expensive ($72,000 for 12 treatments before insurance).  Unfortunately, come January 1st my insurance deductible and out of pockets maximums start over.  As of this date December 26, 2018, I am looking at $10,000 out of pocket and about $3,000 a month for chemotherapy treatments starting in January 2019.  This doesn't include the scans and surgery that I've already had.  This figure will go up come the 1st of January and this is only for the first six months of treatments.  These funds will be used as soon as my bills from the scans and procedures come in.  I am the only one in my household that works full time. The cancer treatments will interfere with the the amount of time I am able to work.  I have my wife Beth,  my children, Christian and Sophia, that I am responsible for.  If I, with your help can raise these funds, it will take a huge financial load off of me and will greatly help me and my family.  I want to be honest and transparent with you guys.  This is a life altering diagnosis for me and my family.  The cards are really stacked against me once the cancer spread to my liver and survival rates aren't high.  I have to be honest with myself and realize that this isn't curable only treatable.  I'm on borrowed time and I pray that I can get this cancer into remission so that I can have more time with my family. So, I am doing something that I never thought I would do in 1000 years,  asking friends and family for help.  Marines are proud, strong and fierce Devil Dogs.  All they need are their brothers/sisters and to be told what and where to attack.  Mission was always first, troop welfare second.  Well, this is my new mission and I need everyones support and help on this one. This is for the fight of my life.  Please help me fight cancer and accomplish my new mission.  Share this post with all your friends and family.  I need to try and touch as many lives as I can. Thank you for taking time to read my story and God bless.Semper FidelisNick",e709a7d0b91e1b1a1cc7dfd48ab4f70c,55,0.5962,30.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

When the company was bought by another steel company, they told my father (who was just years away from retirement) that his retirement pension was no longer guaranteed & that he had to continue to work. He was a mill-wright. He was also the only one at the time who knew how to do his job. After working him to the bones, & missing out on most of his children's lives working swing shifts, he felt extremely betrayed by a company he gave his all to.  All my father ever wanted to do was support his family & provide. He still tells me every day not to work too much or too hard. Since then my father has spent as much time as possible with his family, despite foreclosing on his home, losing everything he had worked for, & starting over when he should have simply been enjoying his retirement. Just weeks ago, at age 62,  my father began not feeling well. It began with cirrhosis. He went to the ER, to find a problem much larger than cirrhosis. He currently has stage 4 metastatic cancer (Spine, Ribs, Lungs, Liver, Pancreas, Brain, Bones). It is a strong possibility that asbestos may have been the cause. While working the steel mill all those years, he was consistently exposed to asbestos.  All we know currently, is that the type of cancer he has is not genetic- we are waiting for final tests & confirmation of origin & cause.  Today he was given 6 months to a year, without treatment. My father's occupation took him away from his family while he was young, & is likely going to be taking him away from his family as an elder.My family needs help affording treatment & hospital bills that are not covered by insurance. I've never started a go fund me before, or asked for money, but it's time to put my pride aside. If you are able to donate, we appreciate it immensely. If you are unable to donate,  please keep my father & my family in your thoughts, & send positive healing vibes. Thank you for all your support <3  https://www.asbestos.com/occupations/steel-mill-workers/",82fdeba54397e20b6009586308192551,22,0.6486666666666666,1.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

In fact, a family friend is living well 15 years after getting the same diagnosis.  My Dad, always wise enough to follow a friend's recommendation, is getting the same treatment from the doctor that pioneered it and is a world leader in the field — Dr Bart Barlogie . The next year or so will have some unpleasant times for my Dad — chemo, stem cell transplants, and days when he's going to feel exceedingly awful — but the outlook after that is good so far.There's not-so-good news — And this is where we need your help. The cost of treatment, while largely covered by insurance, is still steep. In addition, it requires multiple trips to and from NYC, as well as transportation, food, and lodging for the portions of treatment that are outpatient rather than under admission to the hospital. There's the added cost of family traveling with him for support, helping get from airports to hospitals to appointments, etc. Since his starting treatment, he's already gone through $6,000 out-of-pocket and there's many more expenses coming. My Dad's always been a ""pull myself up by the bootstraps"" guy who never likes to ask for help, so I've chosen to create this now, as he's just checked into Mt Sinai for 3 weeks of chemo and stem cell therapy and is physically unable to murder me for asking for help on his behalf. While he'll likely give me the business over this, I can promise you that he, his wife Jan, and the rest of his loved ones will all be so very grateful for any help you can contribute — even if it's not financial. Money certainly helps, but even sharing this fundraiser with others, sending him a kind message, or reaching out to his family in support. It all helps.If this fundraiser generates more than its goal or what's needed to keep my Dad and Jan solvent, the excess funds will be donated to The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.

She had a hysterectomy and was officially staged 3c. It was successful in removing all visible cancer but chemo and radiation were recommended because we also learned she has a very rare and aggressive cancer: carcinosarcoma. It is highly aggressive and often has metastasized to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis. This type of cancer accounts for less than 5% of all uterine cancers. My Mom started chemo (Carbo/Taxol) on 11/27 however when she came for her 2nd round on 12/18 a new and abnormally large (12cm x 20cm) tumor was found in her bowels (she had been having severe abdominal pain). This was extremely upsetting to have a recurrence already. The doctor decided to change to a new chemo (gemzar/taxotere) and she just had her 2nd infusion. This tumor caused her life expectancy to be drastically shortened.Because of her cancer’s rarity and small number of cases there are almost no large studies or trials. The prognosis is poor with a 5 year survival rate of 30%. Most gynecological oncologists have only seen a few cases in their lifetime and may not be aware of the most current treatments. For this reason we are planning to visit out of state cancer hospitals to give her the best chance to slay this beast. The emotional and physical toll has been overwhelming especially since she was so active and healthy before. Her main caretaker has been her husband (my dad). He was laid off from his job in April 2018, costs are high and money is tight. The consultation appointment alone at MD Anderson is over $18,000, and treatments and various needed drugs are anticipated to be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. We are a really close family and my mom truly is the most amazing and strong woman I’ve ever seen. She is caring and kind towards everyone and I want to do anything I can to give her a better chance at life. We appreciate any help we can get, even just sharing this campaign. Thank you all so much and I hope that together we can get my mom back to healthy again!!!",aa851862d27b30b139c3e39253157cad,21,0.3884,30.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Leah teaches in Tacoma where she lives with her girlfriend, Kim, and her two dogs, Jack and Stuart.On 5/4/2018 Leah underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor after experiencing severe headaches. After meeting with her care team at Swedish, she learned that she has brain cancer. The tumor is a grade 4 glioblastoma and Leah will begin radiation and chemotherapy over the next couple weeks.Leah is caring, determined, and has an infectious energy for life. She has already shown so much strength and resilience during this process and we want to continue to support her in every way possible.

A few weeks before Christmas, my cousin and his family received the scary news that their second son is suffering from Hepatoblastoma.  Hepatoblastoma is a very rare form of childhood cancer that starts in the liver. Only one in 1 million children worldwide is affected by this form of cancer per year. Kenjie is my nephew who is almost the same age as my son. I could not imagine how shattering it must be for my cousin and his wife to find out one day that their child has cancer. This is why I thought of raising funds for Kenjie’s medical costs (surgery, hospital bills, medications, chemotherapy) as a way to help and prolong this little one’s life. This baby boy is very clever; he can already read the alphabet, knows the shapes, and identify numbers at such a young age. A sweet bub to all and is always happy, I do believe that he deserves to be treated. He deserves to live. According to my cousin, Kenjie had no symptoms aside from the unusual size of his abdomen and a lump that can be felt along his diaphragm. One night, Kenjie was very fussy and crying; he seemed to be in so much pain, which left his parents uneasy and decided to see a doctor a few days after. Blood tests and scans resulted to a solid mass in this baby’s liver and due to geographical conditions, the only way they can see a paediatric liver specialist is to travel to Manila.My cousin and his family live in a far-flung town called Sta.Ana, Cagayan Valley in the Philippines. To access proper treatment for Kenjie’s condition, his family has to be displaced and travel 16-hours by bus to Philippine General Hospital. The father was an Overseas-Filipino worker who decided to stay in the country since last year to be part of his children’s childhood. He and his wife have online-selling business of all sorts, accepts sushi orders occasionally, and have a small street food stand in the province.Kenjie’s treatment involves admission to the hospital, liver surgery, chemotherapy, infusions, and medications. He is currently neutropenic which means he is very vulnerable to all kinds of infection. The solid mass in his liver has to be removed and the surgery alone costs hundreds and thousands of Philippine peso and is the main concern at the moment. With a fragmented healthcare system that is very hard to access and navigate, my cousins family’s only chance of getting their son operated is through your kind financial donation. Unfortunately for us, there is no universal insurance in our country and out-of-pocket transaction is the only way you can get medical treatment. I believe in the power of kindness.

Look at this doll, beaming (as per usual) at her birthday party:Exactly one month later, on October 2, Jen went to urgent care after a week of unexplained stomach pains. Previously, she’d had no symptoms at all, and a gyn exam just a few months before had come back clear. Then, just one day later, Jen got a CAT scan and was told she had multiple markers of ovarian cancer.She was rushed to the ER and immediately admitted to the hospital for a week, during which time she had two surgeries (laparoscopic biopsy and a port for chemo implanted), two more CAT scans, was diagnosed with Stage 3 ovarian cancer, and started chemo.Jen is now undergoing 9 weeks of weekly chemo, which will be followed by a major hysterectomy surgery, about 5 weeks of recovery time, and then another 9 weeks of weekly chemo.  Oy!She's handling it all with her trademark sass and strength - and an ever-shrinking hairline.  But she can't do it alone.Here's How You Can Help:Thank goodness Jen has great insurance, but as a freelance writer too weakened by unexpected chemo treatments to work, she suddenly has no income - and no savings. Luckily, she has us.(Few know this, but Jen started my writing career by producing the very first staged reading of my plays, and she didn't even know me at the time.  If you're lucky enough to know her, then she's probably touched your life in a similar way. Let's give back.)With YOUR help, we’ll cover Jen’s living expenses and any other medically-related costs that come up during the estimated 8-month period of her treatment and recovery, as she focuses on her health and healing. Please join Team Jen and GIVE WHAT YOU CAN - as soon as you can!And then SHARE THIS FUNDRAISER!And follow this latest chapter in Jen’s story, as she chronicles her experiences with her trademark authenticity, humility and humor on Instagram @jennifergaram .Thank you so much for anything you can contribute.

He is a pastor, devoted husband, father, and grandfather, and community activist (please watch the video for more details of his service to the community).  While helping thousands, Deron has been fighting for his life. Here's the story of his battle...How It All StartedIn 2008, Deron suffered from an aortic aneurysm that almost took his life.  He had a miraculous recovery and returned to full function with routine follow-up CT scans to make sure his surgically repaired aneurysm had remained stable.  On one of these scans in 2015, an incidental finding was made.  He had a concerning spot in one of his lungs that ultimately was diagnosed as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  NSCLC is one of the few types of lung cancer that is not caused by smoking (see here for more information  https://www.cancer.org/cancer/non-small-cell-lung-cancer/about.html).  The great news: the diagnosis was made really early, even before he developed any symptoms.  After undergoing more testing, it was determined to be Stage I (still only in his lungs with no spread to any other places in his body).  A successful treatment plan was developed, and the cancer was now in remission.From Stage I to Stage IVTwo years after going into remission, Deron received some bad news.  On routine follow-up radiographic imaging studies, Deron was found to have a concerning spot in his lung that had grown since his prior study but was too small to biopsy.  He was advised to wait 3-4 months and have another study to monitor the spot on his lung. However, before that time came, he developed what he thought were migraine headaches.  He was seen by a neurologist and extensively tested but the headaches continued to get worse.  On 7/26/17 while preparing to do the 10th anniversary of his ""She's Fabulously 40 & Over"" production, at the advice of a fellow pastor, he went to see his ophthalmologist.  The ophthalmologist referred him to a neuro-ophthalmologist and he worked all day to get an appointment with one of the top neuro-ophthalmologists in the country the next day. The doctor took one look into his eyes (considered the window to what is going on in the brain) and advised him to go back to the Emergency Department to have more testing done, including a spinal tap (a test where fluid is taken from your spinal canal to check for different diseases).On 7/31/2017, the day before his 51st birthday, Deron received preliminary results of the spinal tap. His lung cancer was now metastatic because it had spread from the lungs to another organ or body part.  In his case, the cancer had spread to the spinal fluid and the cells along the lining of his brain and changed his classification from Stage I cancer to Stage IV.  At this point, he was told he could only have a year to live (or less).  The silver lining in all this pre-birthday news was the fact that through genetic testing done during his original cancer diagnosis evaluation, he was known to have an EGFR mutation, a feature of the cancer found in less than 15% of patients with NSCLC. This made him an excellent candidate for a targeted therapy called Tarceva (see more information about Tarceva here:  http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/Tarceva.aspx).  Even better was the fact that he'd already gone through a lengthy approval process to get his insurance company to pay for the medicine when his EGFR mutation was detected.  He was able to start taking Tarceva immediately and was discharged on 8/4/17. He was in the next phase of his journey to beat cancer.  Although he was severely fatigued and still suffering from severe headaches, this dedicated SOLDIER managed to preach the 8:00 AM service on 8/6/2017!!Time for a New MedicationFor a time, things went seemingly well on Tarceva.  Within 6 weeks, he was already starting to show signs of improvement on his imaging studies.  While Tarceva initially slowed the progression of his disease (i.e., kept his lung tumor from getting bigger and his brain disease from worsening), he developed debilitating side effects and his radiographic improvement began to become questionable at best.  His medical team then began the process to get his insurance company to approve coverage of Tagrisso, a medicine approved for cancer treatment by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2017 then upgraded to the 1st line treatment for EGFR-mutated NSCLC in April 2018 ( https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2018/us-fda-approves-tagrisso-as-1st-line-treatment-for-EGFR-mutated-non-small-cell-lung-cancer.html).  It was approved but came with a $15,000.00 per month copay for a 30-day supply.  He, like most of you reading this, was of course unable to afford this and applied for a patient assistance program to help pay for it.  After initially being denied and having to show excessive medical debt during a lengthy appeal process, Deron found out on 5/8/18 that he was approved for the program.  By the grace of God, he could now start the life-saving treatment!  Almost immediately, his clinical status improved.  His strength returned such that he no longer needed assistance walking to and from the pulpit to preach.  What's more, he began to show what was thought to be radiographic improvement on an MRI done just prior to starting Tagrisso.  On 8/8/18, he went for routine follow-up imaging.  This time, his doctors did a CT scan with contrast which revealed a slight increase in his cancer activity which they couldn't say with certainty wasn't there 3 months prior.  Since it was a different type of test it was like comparing apples to oranges. Despite how well he still looked clinically, due to the aggressive nature of Stage IV NSCLC, his doctors recommended increasing the dose of Tagrisso to combat any possible progression of the disease.  How Can You Help?The last 3 years have been an emotionally and financially taxing experience.  God's Love has been expressed through many acts of kindness and has carried Deron and his family through.  Deron must undergo extensive and expensive medical testing every 3 months and at any point could be denied assistance paying the $15,000 monthly copay. He needs help raising enough to pay off his current medical bills and cover the copay for at least one month. Having to seek financial support in this way, and vulnerably share this process in such a public fashion is a truly humbling experience. We are standing in faith believing that there are people Deron has blessed across the nation and globe over the last 25+ years of ministry who are willing to provide a financial blessing during this time of great need. Whether you can give $10, $10,000 or more toward the goal of being able to support the mounting medical expenses and complex medical treatments he is undergoing, no amount is too small!  In addition to making a voluntary donation, we also need your prayers for another display of God's healing power for Deron.  If Deron, or this story, has touched your heart in any way, please donate any amount you can, and we'll pray that God blesses you for your generosity.  We'll let you know how things go with his next round of tests and our search for other programs to assist cancer patients.  If you happen to know of any resources we should try, please include that in your comments.  Thanks, in advance, for your support!",1b195c9aaa8763ba53a0177b2b464b92,55,1.1567,150.0,6,1,1,2,1,2,1,0.0014577259475218659,0.0007288629737609329,0.08996272972625627,3.0372266601520685,1.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

Because I need to give it a name. I need to call it something besides 'the tumor' and this way I can say, ""Check out the big brain on Brad!""  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ajQxAnNno&feature=youtu.beBecause the only way I can survive this bullshit is by filling the situation with humor. I know it's not at all laughing matter, but it's the only way to not drive myself completely insane. I don't need to give Brad any help with that, he's doing a fine job on his own.Now, Brad and I go way back. I'm not sure how far back exactly, but I'm pretty sure we've been hanging out for a pretty good portion of my life. He's always on my mind. In fact, he's so deep in my head that he quite literally changes the way I do things and the way I think. He's made me do things that are definitely uncharacteristic of my normal self, and he's made me think that it's just me when it's him on numerous occasions. The more I look back on my life, the more I wonder how much Brad has influenced my decisions and my behavior, and how much of my memory he's stolen without me even knowing.One of the things Brad like to do is make me think I've been there before, you know, like a deja vu. Normally it's not too bad, but it can get pretty intense. On the opposite side of the spectrum, Brad likes to make me forget things as well. The thing where he makes me feel like I've been there before is weird, but we've all experienced it at some point, I'm sure. The part where he makes me forget things has been getting worse lately, and I've been chalking it up to getting older, but I now know it's just Brad. The bastard.About 4 years ago, Brad decided that he wanted to be a bigger part of my life, and he decided to take control of my whole brain at once. This resulted in a grand mal seizure while I was driving 55mph on The 5 near Magic Mountain. Miraculously, we were the only vehicle in the accident, and Jessica and I both walked away from the accident with no major physical injuries. This is where Brad's presence in our lives was first realized, but we didn't know it was him just yet.Since that first seizure, a lot of things definitely changed. Brad's presence was not yet known, but he was absolutely having much more of an influence on me than I was aware of. I personally thought things were fine. I felt fine. Brad made me feel like I was fine. In fact, he kept telling me that everything was OK, and that anything odd I was noticing was just because I was tired or hadn't had enough sleep. I have a history of insomnia, so I believed him. Brad is really good at convincing me things are fine when they're not. One of the last seizures he caused, he was telling me it wasn't a seizure as it was beginning. I even relayed the message to my wife before Brad took completely over, but she knew better than I, because Brad a total control of my mind and what I was feeling. He made me think I was fine, and even say I was fine. I was not.While we wait to see what the next steps are to end my relationship with Brad, I am very much being faced with my own mortality. I feel like I am sitting down with Death for interview once again. This is not a position I've even applied for, so I really hope the interview doesn't go well and he sends me back on my way. It's not my first interview with him, I've been here before. I'm hoping for the best outcome with everything here, yet I am preparing for the worst.As I look back on my entire life, I wonder how much control Brad has had over me over the years. When he makes me do something uncharacteristic of my normal self, he also makes me forget it, because he's literally hijacked my brain for that moment. With some of the things my wife is telling me, I'm feeling that I might owe people some apologies. I know I definitely owed her some. And now that we know that Brad is here and what he's capable of, a lot of things that I've done make much more sense to Jess and myself.I truly am sorry for anything I've ever done to hurt anyone, especially my friends. I've always prided myself on being someone with a heart of gold and a willingness to help out anyone in need, but I think Brad may not have the same things in mind. With the love that I'm seeing from everyone on these posts, I don't think Brad's pissed too many people off for me, but please let me know if you think you've had en encounter with him so I can make up for it.Also, as I'm looking back on my life, I am seeing a lot of the good things, and remembering the good times with a lot of you. Some of you might get a random text message or email from me soon... don't feel like you have to respond to it, I'm just needing to let people know how I feel, and maybe bring up some old fun memories and put some smiles on your faces. I want to let some of you know what an influence you've had on my life, or maybe how much I appreciate you, or remind you of that time we did that thing... you know what I'm talking about. Don't feel bad if you don't get one though, Brad might keep crossing names of my list to fuck with me, or he might tell me I already sent you something...What now? I've got an appointment with a neurosurgeon on Monday, and hopefully he'll be able to give me some more answers about Brad, and what our next steps are. Until then, I'm going to be freaking out, wondering if this is the end for me or if this is just a really fucked up opening to an amazing new beginning.What can you do to help? Not much. I'm pretty emotional right now, and keep bouncing back and forth between wanting to talk to people and wanting to crawl into a hole. I absolutely LOVE getting text messages and phone calls and emails from everyone. The love that I'm feeling is really helping keep my spirits up, A LOT. I might not want to talk a lot right now, or I might, it depends on what Brad wants me to do I guess, but hearing your voicemails is amazing, and your support through this difficult time is absolutely mind blowing. Thank you.In an effort to separate Brad from myself, I've set him up with his own email account, BradTheBrainTumor@Gmail.com. Feel free to send him messages to tell him what you think of him or to ask him to leave me alone. I know others are going through similar situations, so I've also created a subreddit for him so that others can yell at Brad or vent their frustrations as well.

My sister's nephew, 24year old Amit Tumma, desperately needs your generosity. This is Amit's story.Amit Tumma is born to a loving and extremely hardworking lower class family in Pune. Despite this, he graduated with a degree in Civil Engineering. After the tragic death of his father four years ago, he became the breadwinner and the pillar for his mother. Any semblance of normalcy in their lives following his father's death was quickly shattered because of Amit's diagnosis: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (a type of blood cancer). He needs a bone marrow transplantation within the next few weeks and this has a price tag of 15 lakh rupees (roughly 21,000 USD). The amount is simply too big for one person to arrange and the situation is very dire. Could you please consider donating for Amit's surgery and helping his mother and him have a chance at normal life again?

I have been employed, as a groomer, by Bella's Grooming for the past 2 years. Richard & Christina are my bosses but they have become sincere friends that I care deeply about. We have all spent a lot of time together both at work and outside of it and I have gotten to know them well.If you don't know their story, Richard & Christina moved from NY to VA in March 2015. They opened their shop in April 2015 and have been serving the community for almost 4 years. They built their business from the ground up, often working long days. I've seen them come in early, stay late and even work on their days off. Richard has been grooming for close to 18 years and I have learned so much from him in my time here. He will always stop what he's doing to both show and explain things to me. Christina does a lot of things here but primarily does ""front of the house."" She usually always deals with the customers. I have found her to be friendly & personable. We could be having an insane day and she always takes a moment to converse with every person that calls or stops by. After years of hard work, they were finally able to purchase their first home in May 2018.If you do not know, this family has fallen on tough times recently. In August 2017, their son Hadrian aka Georgie was diagnosed with Level 2 Autism. In December 2018, Richard was diagnosed with advance stage lymphoma. During the month of December, Richard did not have health insurance. In December, he had 2 hospital stays, 2 surgeries, an MRI, CT Scan, multiple prescriptions and started chemotherapy...all without health coverage. Though Rich is ""lucky"" to have health coverage for 2019, the treatments he is undergoing are considered somewhat ""experimental"". Their insurance company continues to fight them tooth & nail on most claims they receive. Aside from medical bills, they, like all of us, have day to day expenses, household expenses, etc. They are commuting to both Farmville & Lynchburg daily for treatments. I think that Richard & Christina are the backbone of America. They are small business owners that live and work in the community they serve. They employ local people (me) and help keep money in Charlotte County. They have worked too hard to have everything they've achieved be taken away by the ugly disease that is cancer. Since they are self-employed, they don't get the luxuries that some of us may take for granted including sick time, medical leave, holiday pay, etc. If they're not working, they're not making money. Dedicating time to work can be difficult while dealing with an intensive treatment regimen & daily commutes.I wanted to start this fundraiser as a way to help some folks I care about. We have watched each other's kids grow. Georgie was only 4 months old when I started here, now hes over 2 years! They were there for me at the hospital when I had my daughter. They were also at my wedding in August 2018. I'm asking everyone, if you can help in some way, please do so. Even the smallest donation will make a difference to this family.",c8f9057b90d6231eff78b01b1a286928,35,0.8416666666666667,1.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Hert2 positive invasive ductal carcinoma in my right breast. I named her Camilla, the terrible party tit. She was always the prettiest one which just goes to show that looks can be deceiving. Finished my 6 rounds of chemo on December 18th and will undergo a bilateral mastectomy to remove the original factory models on January 29th, 2019I've felt since first suspecting breast cancer that I was meant to go through this experience. Chemo challenged me but I refused to give up on the cabaret show I created and the work planned so I continued to perform throughout treatment. Had a head shaving party, bought some wig glue and made it happen. It was difficult but I learned my first lesson from cancer; I'm a wee bit tougher than I give myself credit for. Lesson number two; Yes, it is possible to talk myself away from worshiping the porcelain god, get on a plane and seven hours later have a killer show with my cast and a packed house. (*cough* Club Cumming, and thank you) Cancer and chemo gave me the chance to listen to my body differently and I cleared hurtles I'm still surprised by. However, I've become fully aware of the toll chemo has taken on my body and its all catching up with me. I've struggled with neuropathy in my hands and feet, vocal issues, muscle fatigue and cognitive impairment that I managed to power through. In some cases I found ways to grow from a side effect or body pain through dance and vocalizing or other creative outlets but I have officially hit the self help wall and insurance doesn't cover everything. Now comes the hardest part...no, not surgery. Well, yes, surgery but also asking for help. ( Yet another lesson courtesy of Camilla.) Donations will help me cover expenses and in home care while out of work postop, (The next 4 to 6 weeks) continued lymphatic drainage, acupuncture to help with neuropathy and muscle spasms, physical, vocal and other therapeutic treatments. Luckily, the remaining 10 Hert2 antibody treatments are not as difficult to get through, but I refuse to move backwards during my recovery. This is where the real work happens for me. Coming back from the mental and physical impact of it all. Thank you to all who've sent words of reinforcement and messages of love. It helps push me. I still have every intention of standing on the other side of this and saying cancer was the best thing that ever happened to me. I mean, have you seen my bald head?

In between has been an emotional and traumatic rollercoaster for he, his wife Edith and their precious girls Laia & Kyla. Given the complex and mysterious nature of this particular cancer and because of an initial dire prognosis of “1-2 years” survival, Tom and Edith spread a wide net in search of treatments and therapies that could possibly improve those odds. Fortunately, they eventually found Dr. Holbrook and his team at Deaconess Hospital in Spokane, Washington. On November 26th the doctor performed the 8 hour surgery, and though the pathology report indicated that Tom had a particularly aggressive from of appendix cancer, the doctor is optimistic that in combination with chemo Tom’s chances are good that he’d have many years ahead of him to spend with his loving family. The slow process of recovery has been challenging – 22 days intensive recovery in the hospital, followed by the current day-to-day incremental progress to gain the strength and energy to resume a normal life – has made Tom understand why he is called a ‘patient!’. At the outset Tom & Edith decided to not let cost dictate their path and chose instead to seek whatever showed promise in treating this strange disease, no matter the cost. Bills have mounted (which included medical, alternative therapies, supplements, time off of work, etc), but the focus on exploring the right path for Tom has been worth it, as while they are deeply in debt they take great comfort in their prospects for a healthy future that they gained through Dr. Holbrook. WHY WE ARE RAISING MONEY - If you know Tom Shamrell, you love him. His infectious smile, his dry wit, and his passion for family and friends all make Tom such a bright light in our world.Tom is fighting cancer that began in his appendix and metastasized.

Soon after, he went to jog and he fell down; he had lost his ability to walk normally. Mike's left leg has a drag that prevents him from standing, walking,  or keeping his balance. A local Neurologist performed numerous tests, MRI's and scans on Mike for 7 months trying to find a cause of Mike's serious medical condition.  The Neurologist was unable to make a diagnosis and referred Mike to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville for more neurology testing hoping for a diagnosis. In September the Neurologist diagnosed Mike with Multiple Sclerosis which affects his left leg , spine and lower back areas. The Neurologist told Mike that his ability to walk and keep his balance were greatly affected by the MS.  The Neurologist said that Mike's ability to walk, stand or maintain his balance could not be corrected. The Neurologist would devise a medication plan hoping to prevent further neurological disabilities. In October Mike had surgery to repair an inguinal hernia. During surgery the Surgeon discovered a rare malignant sarcoma cancer mass within his pelvic area. Because of this rare type of sarcoma Mike was referred to a specialist Oncologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville. In November this Oncologists put Mike through more tests, scans and MRI's to determine the exact location of the sarcoma cancer and if the cancer had spread to other locations. In December the Oncologist and Urologist determined that Mike needs surgery within his pelvic area hoping to remove the malignant sarcoma cancer.The Oncologist said the surgery could be performed in the coming weeks in January 2019.Unfortunately In December Mike was unable to pay for his health insurance. Florida Healthcare canceled his health insurance and his surgery was also canceled. He is trying to get FL Medicaid Insurance which the University of Florida Hospital does accept and would provide Mike's further medical surgery and medical care.Since last January, Mike has not been able to work due to his serious medical conditions. Due to the length of time waiting for a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis and Malignant Sarcoma Cancer Surgery, he has depleted his financial abilities.  Mike really needs our financial help if you can. Any financial amount will be very helpful.Why we need your help:Mike has not been able to work since last January and is out  of funds to pay for his eventual cancer surgery, medical treatments, medical costs and living expenses.  He needs our financial help if you can help him. Any financial amount will help Mike  and is sincerely appreciated.Before his medical lapse, Mike had a solid 20 year career employed within the executive protection and security management business. He protected dignitaries, foreign diplomats, business executives and celebrities worldwide.  Mike was also the Director of Security at the Volusia Mall in Daytona Beach . Prior to these positions Mike served as a Police Officer for 13 years in both New Hampshire and Florida.We  are coming here to ask for your financial help for our friend in need.  We are grateful for any financial amount you can give to help with his serious medical care costs.

Rachael grew an egg!! Hurray! But not the fun kind. Boo!On January 3rd Rachael was diagnosed with a rare cancerous tumor in her head called a  Biphenotypic Sarcoma. Dr. Geltzeiler is the lead surgeon on Rachael's Oncology team. Her team at the Knight Cancer Institute at OHSU specialize exclusively in cancers of the head and neck. Dr. Geltzeiler says this specific type of cancer is ""the rarest of the rare"", but they have put together a specialized action plan to kick this tumor's ass!What can you do to help?!? There's a list of ways to offer her your support listed down the at bottom. :) A Biphenotypic Sarcoma is a type of cancer primarily eats connective tissue. In Rachael's case that means it is eating the bone and cartilage in her head. It is a lumpy egg shape with the small end pushing out the skin of her eye socket, and the big end pushing onto her brain cavity. It is about 1 inch wide and about 2 or so inches deep. Specifically, the tumor is growing forward out of her right eye ridge/orbital socket, and growing backwards where it has eroded the cribaform plate, the thin little bone plate that separates the frontal lobe of her brain from the front of her face.It’s gonna be a LONG and SERIOUS procedure. She will be getting incisions inside her nose, a few in her face, and on top of her head from ear to ear like a rainbow. During the surgery the oncology team will remove as much of the tumor as they can, and remove all the bone, cartilage, and any soft tissue the tumor has destroyed. There is a possibility she may lose her right eye, but they will not know until they start the surgery. Rachael says: ""He straight up told me he had to fight to keep my eyeball. The panel of sarcoma doctors wanted to take my right eye. But since this isn’t a cancer that likes to spread, they’re gonna leave it alone. But that means the cancer will probably come back in a few years."" After they remove all the bad stuff, they will rebuild her eye socket, rebuild her cribaform plate, all the internal supporting structures of connective tissue, and a bunch of little bones inside her head. Dr. Geltzeiler says: ""There’s a plastic surgeon on the team to try and keep your face from too much disfigurement, but chances are you might want to do some more after you're healed to remove any scars or damage to your face.""She will in the hospital for several days after the surgery, and have an extended recovery at home. She will be out of work for at least a month, then she gets to start radiation therapy! Rachael's radiation treatment schedule will be 5 days a week for 6 weeks. That's 30 trips up the hill to OHSU and back!Rachael is sparkly happiness. <3 Her energy sticks to you like glitter and leaves you feeling like you've just been included in a secret fancy party even when she is just saying hello. She is going to need love, friendship, and cash to help her through this long process. Every dollar adds up. So if you can only donate a little that's okay, and if you can donate a lot, now's the time to share. <3Rachael is looking at 6 months treatment and recovery time till she's fully back in action. In the next 2 weeks she is going to need donations to help make up for the time she has to take off work for pre-surgery appointments. She will also need to buy things that aren't on Amazon like pre and post surgery medical supplies, meals, and transportation costs.  After surgery Rachael will need help paying her bills, transportation getting to and from the hospital for radiation treatments and follow up appointments, and help with medical costs her insurance won't cover. A big side effect of the radiation is fatigue, so it is going to take a bit of time before she is completely up to speed and able to work full time to support herself independently again. This isn’t a cancer that likes to spread, but she will be getting her head regularly scanned for the rest of her life, because this is a type of cancer that is likely to come back every few years. Please donate what you can!  We are hoping to be able to get her all prepped and ready to go by her surgery date February 4th.Here is a link to Rachael's Amazon wishlist. Gift cards are great because they are versatile and easy to use.  http://a.co/iBzhbRd You can also send her money by searching ""Rachael Reckless"" or Rachael Belknap"" on:VenmoCash AppPayPal#RecklessVsCancer #RachaelKillsCancer #OHSU #KnightCancerInstitute*The GoFindMe donation request may increase as her medical treatment progresses.*",120d7f4bb481f5145f6cd5a6063ffb24,42,0.7826,16.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

We've gone through A LOT together. He helped me through losing my Dad, my brother and when we lost our second child in 2016. He is my rock and we have persevered through it all.We've been working out a game plan for our family for a few years. And THIS year we got it.  BIG STEPS!We bought our first house, Rob started law school at WVU College of Law in August and I was integrating our young family into a new place. I noticed I was losing weight in August but chalked it up to the stress of our move and figuring out a new budget for a family of 4 on student loans and what I brought in waitressing and doing a little art. Then I noticed some pea sized lymph nodes popping up along my collar bone. NOT GOOD. We were transitioning from Rob working full time with benefits to getting Medicaid for health care and I was hoping it wasn't severe and that I'd get to a doctor soon. Then my arm seemed to have less blood flow and began to feel bruised though there was no discoloration. ""Perhaps it's from Viv's head resting on my arm  night after night"", I told myself. Either way I made an appointment for a thermography scan because it was an out of pocket cost I could cover till we got insurance set up.I never had that scan.I began feeling around and found inflamed lymph nodes under my armpit and this combined with the arm pain sent me to Urgent Care in fear one evening thinking I had some massive infection. The doctors referred me to an Oncologist as soon as they saw me. They had no doubts it seemed. ""Too many swollen lymphs, not just 1 or 2.""A mammogram was scheduled, an ultrasound and a biopsy. Then in WAY less time than I was told it would take I got a phone call just before naptime. YOU HAVE BREAST CANCER. I couldn't cry, the kids were right there with me. I said thank you, no, no more questions and hung up.""We'll hope for an advanced Stage III"", the Oncologist said. ""You'll have to stop breastfeeding immediately so we can get accurate PET scan results"", said the surgeon.  Ending my goal of 2 years of breastfeeding for Viv at just before the 17 month mark in a most heartbreaking manner. Rob's parents came to watch the kids while we went in for the PET results. I was hanging onto Stage III thoughts of some chemo, surgery and becoming a pink ribbon warrior. We go back to a small room and a new Nurse Practioner came in. She laid it right out.You have Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer that has spread to your lymph nodes, bones and liver. With treatment average expected life span is 1-2 years. When the Oncologist came in she said MAYBE 5 years.It was two and a half weeks from the time I went to urgent care to receiving the Stage IV prognosis. Ever since the general diagnosis things have moved VERY FAST. I was told that I would have to do chemotherapy for the rest of my life. I was told the side effects of chemotherapy were mild and would go away within a couple days after treatment especially given my age. On the Monday after Thanksgiving I went in for my first chemo treatment.  The next day I felt terrible. This was to be expected, but my body's reaction was much greater than anticipated for the typical chemo patient. Dangerously high fevers,  severe bone pain and headaches, mouth ulcers, acid reflux, skin rashes, bloody discharges and a general inability to get out of bed are what I continue to experience now 6 days after chemotherapy treatment. And the reactions to chemotherapy are only suppose to get worse over time after every treatment! Chemotherapy has made me incapable of living my life and being a mother. From the moment I knew I had cancer Rob and I started doing research nonstop of treatment options.  We found nutritional protocols that had dozens if not hundreds of testimonials from Stage III and IV cancer survivors who say the protocols worked to reduce their tumor sizes and vastly increase their quality of life. We found Dr. Gonzalez and Dr. Issacs treatment protocol that appear to be very promising and have proven results via case studies. We found clinics that are outside of the U.S.  (Mexico and Switzerland) that also have proven results for later stage cancer patients. It is my belief that cancer does not have one source cause and likewise it does not have one silver bullet solution. It is my belief that I must detoxify my mind, body and spirit. I must rebuild my healthy body one cell at a time while destroying the cancer inside me. It is also my belief that chemotherapy FOR ME as a late Stage IV cancer patient is not the correct treatment solution. I want to pursue alternative treatments that I think are more effective for my situation and will enhance my quality of life, not totally diminish it. I started an anti-cancer vegan diet and an intense anti-cancer supplement protocol last week. I sent all my medical records to Dr. Issacs yesterday and I am waiting to hear back. I continue to research other doctor's around the world who may be able to help me. With the help of my husband, family and friends I am leaving no stone unturned. I am determined to defy my prognosis! I am determined to increase my well being and live everyday to the fullest. I am determined to take nothing for granted.  For more information on Dr. Issacs, please follow these links:  https://www.drlindai.com/pursuing_alt_ther.html ,  http://www.alternative-therapies.com/at/web_pdfs/gonzalez1.pdf , Unfortunately, none of these alternative treatments are covered in any way by our insurance. I need your help to pursue my healing journey. Dr. Issacs protocol/treatment is relatively inexpensive, but not covered by insurance. The initial visit and evaluations is $ 4500.00. Each required six month follow up is $650.00, and each intermittent doctor's visit is $300.00. There are additional therapies in this protocol that we do not have prices for, but will cost at least a few hundred dollars per treatment. Dr. Issacs supplement protocol typically costs around $1000.00 per month. The diet I am on, which I anticipate will be similar to what Dr. Issacs will recommend, cost approximately $600 -$800 dollars per month (just for me, not including family groceries). The clinics we have researched are typically 3 week programs that, according to patients who have attended these clinics, cost anywhere from $13,000.00 - $25, 000.00. Here are links to a few clinics we find promising:  http://www.hope4cancer.com, http://www.hoxseybiomedical.com, http://www.sanoviv.com, https://www.alronc.com.This journey without insurance coverage is very expensive. That is why I need your help, your love and healing thoughts. Please consider supporting me and my family with whatever you feel comfortable giving. Every little bit helps. We need support at least until Rob finishes law school. As I am not working,  additional financial assistance allows us not to worry about money and enjoy the time I have everyday with my family! Please have faith and confidence in my treatment decisions! I feel confident that if I am able to pursue this path of wellness and healing I will live to see my children grow up!                                                                         THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!",27b82d280cafa30c339ae1c7e8682ade,74,0.48406666666666665,30.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

My mom has always raised me to follow my dreams and put my best effort into any path I chose to pursue.

She has always put her family's needs before her own. Now it's time for us to put her before her family. In July 2018 she was diagnosed with DCIS or Stage 0 breast cancer.

She had been experiencing severe pain in her lower back since April, but she initially attributed the pain to overdoing it at her longstanding job as a server at Dover Downs Casino in Delaware. As the pain worsened in the ensuing months and began to interfere with her ability to walk comfortably, Lara tried to remedy the issue with a chiropractor, massage therapy and exercise while she waited for an MRI. By July, the back pain, along with other symptoms, forced her to stop working. When Lara finally received the MRI, her doctor summoned her to the office right away. The MRI revealed that she had a large mass on her sacrum, which is the bone at the base of the spine just above the tailbone. After other tests, her oncologist confirmed that Lara not only had cancer in her sacrum, but also that cancer was found in several organs throughout her abdomen. Her diagnosis is Stage 4 metastatic cancer, and Lara has been told there is no cure.The treatment plan at the moment is to bring the cancer under control and to give her some relief. Lara has undergone radiation treatments designed to reduce her back pain and has just begun chemotherapy to stop the growth of the tumors and hopefully reduce their size. Lara’s doctors and other caregivers at the Helen Graham Cancer Center at Christiana Hospital in Delaware have been absolutely tremendous, and they are fully supporting our family’s current exploration of a second opinion at the University of Pennsylvania’s Abramson Cancer Center to see if we can find an alternative treatment path. Lara is also receiving consultation and support from UPMC Medical Center in her childhood home of Altoona, Pennsylvania. Throughout this ordeal, Lara has shown remarkable strength and resilience. Certainly there have been tears, but she has been far more concerned with how this news is affecting her family and friends than she has been with herself. She has an upbeat positive attitude and is determined to fight the cancer with everything she has. Her trademark hilarious sense of humor, youthful spirit, and deep compassion for others remain on full display all the time and she is still as fun as ever to be around. She isn’t going to let cancer take away her joy and is determined not to allow it to define her life. She has too much she wants to do, too many people to see, and too much love to give. With a strong faith, a positive mindset and the extraordinary support she is receiving from her family and some truly exceptional friends in her beloved Smyrna, Delaware, Lara has a great deal of hope for what is possible in her future. One of the hardest parts of this situation for Lara has been asking for help. Lara’s entire adult life has been marked by giving help and comfort to others. She has helped friends who have tragically lost loved ones too early in life. She has emptied her freezer to give food to a friend who lost a job. She has often dropped everything to listen to a friend or a customer who was experiencing a crisis or just needed to talk. She has volunteered to help friends move and provided countless other favors. She has been a shoulder to cry on and a wise giver of advice and encouragement. She has done all of this without bringing attention to herself, and with no expectation of anything in return.Lara was reluctant to allow us to create this GoFundMe site for her, but her cancer has been financially devastating. Apart from losing her livelihood, her savings have been depleted. She has required help to cover her basic needs. One practical way we can all support her in this difficult time is to ease her financial burden. Except for the small processing fee charged by GoFundMe, 100% of donations made to this site will go for Lara’s living expenses and medical needs. Thank you very much for considering a donation.",f4aaf6e2a2a2e59b34a15886955685c1,31,1.0254,21.0,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Jason is a light to those who know him; everything he touches feels brighter with his presence. And now it’s our turn to shine a light on him.In the summer of 2013, Jason went for a routine physical and came out with a stage 3 melanoma diagnosis… a battle that continues to this day. After multiple surgeries, blood work, PET scans and a seemingly endless series of doctor’s appointments, Jason underwent the removal of more than 70 lymph nodes.  With friends and family by his side, Jason battled this diagnosis, and continued his life as a father and family provider with renewed optimism.After a year and a half, Jason learned the melanoma had spread to a satellite location on his back.

It was the summer of 2017 when Coach received a call that would mark the beginning of a very unexpected journey. He was notified by his physician to immediately report to the emergency room after his routine physical revealed severely low blood levels. Tests would prove that a cancerous tumor in his colon was to blame. The tumor was successfully surgically removed, but some malignant cells were also found on his liver. He was scheduled for chemotherapy and radiation to attack the spots on his liver once he healed from the surgery. The first round of chemotherapy went relatively well, as the spots decreased slightly in size. The radiation treatments began next, but they didn't perform as well as we would have hoped. A few new small spots were also visible at the end of radiation, so he began a second round of chemotherapy. Coach was a few weeks into his treatment when he had to be rushed to the hospital. Doctors ultimately discovered that one of the cancerous spots had grown and connected to his stomach. And that brings us to today. 
The next step in Coach's journey is a pilgrimage to the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX. They are world renown and recognized as the top cancer hospital in the United States.  We believe that getting Coach to the MD Anderson team puts us in a position to win, and that's what we plan to do! We have been amazed at the outpouring of love we have received so far in this journey. And countless people have asked us to let them know if they could help us in any way. Well, we now have a very particular way that you can help. Coach's first trip to Houston will be on Dec 11. And he and Mrs. Randall will likely be splitting time between Texas and Virginia for the next several months.  We ask that you would consider making a donation to help cover the costs associated with their travel to and from Texas. The funds will also assist them with the numerous unforeseen expenses and bills that have come their way.   



Lastly, we ask that you join us in prayer for healing from heaven through this medical team. We pray as a team at 10:00 am EST daily, and we would love for you to stop for a minute or two each day at that appointed time to pray for Coach's championship over cancer!

Paul was diagnosed with brain cancer.Paul had not been feeling like himself for several weeks. He had been experiencing headaches, dizziness, and pressure in his ear. His doctor first thought it was possibly an ear infection. Paul then thought he had caught the flu. The morning of October 1st Paul fell which led to a visit to the Emergency Room. After many tests that day, we were told it was brain cancer. No words can express how devastated we were to hear this news. Our world was flipped upside down. Paul was admitted to the hospital and given steroids but his condition continued to quickly deteriorate. The decision was made to airlift Paul to Mayo Hospital in Rochester for life saving brain surgery. Paul underwent two surgeries on October 4th to remove a softball sized tumor. The pathology report came back with more bad news. The tumor is a Grade IV Glioblastoma. It is a very aggressive cancer and spreads quickly with a median survival rate of only 18-20 months. This is the same type of cancer that took Senator John McCain's life a short time ago.At just 46 years old, Paul never dreamed his days would be filled with doctor appointments and therapies. Until the day of his diagnosis, he was a typical man working for a living and raising his family. Paul has a wife and two children. Paul continues to heal at home and get stronger to fight the battle for his life. He has begun the long process of radiation and chemotherapy.  Although the prognosis is grim, there is always hope. Anyone who knows Paul knows he is stubborn and doesn’t give up easily. He plans to fight this cancer with every fiber of his being.We started this fundraiser to help the family fill the financial hole created by this terrible disease.

They have been married over 6 years and are still madly in love. They have 3 beautiful children- Janna (4), Reed (2), and the latest edition, Eva, who was born in June of this year. Brand new baby Eva was only 10 days old when Reed's aggressive malignant tumor showed it's ugly face. Reed was only two and a half years old. His diagnosis is osteosarcoma. Thankfully, subsequent bone scans and other tests reveal it is Stage I, with no current evidence of metastasis. Sarah and Jake are strong and remain positive for their children and families as they trek two hours each way with Reed and baby Eva to and from Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC for Reed's chemotherapy treatments. Reed is a trooper, despite losing his hair and his appetite from the aggressive chemo chemicals used to treat his cancer. Testing revealed his cancer involves his entire upper right arm bone and soft tissue, up to the shoulder joint. His doctors have scheduled 18 chemotherapy treatments at Children's Hospital in DC over the course of 6 months- all requiring a minimum stay of 3 days. He is scheduled to have his right arm removed at the shoulder later in October after his 6th chemo treatment. This drastic measure helps to increase his chances for long-term survival, which is not guaranteed, due to the aggressive nature of his cancer. He resumes his regimen of chemo for 12 more treatments shortly after the surgery. Reed has been strong and resilient through it all. His sweet little body has been pushed to the limits yet he always comes home with a smile and hug for everyone, especially his older sister Janna who anxiously awaits their return. Sarah and Jake have a huge circle of friends and family that are supportive, but they cannot carry the financial burden alone. The reality is that protracted cancer therapies, along with follow up evaluations, runs into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, at a minimum! The family will with no doubt, emotionally and mentally, be able to get through this. However, currently with only one income, the medical and travel expenses are starting to pile up. We hope with this site we can help alleviate that stressful burden a bit.

(Jeremiah 17:14)Erin Mazelin McNamara, daughter of Steve and Cynthia Mazelin was born and raised in Indianapolis with her two siblings, Shannon Mazelin Wiltshire and Mark Mazelin.   Erin’s parents instilled in her a solid foundation of faith as she attended grade school at St. Thomas Aquinas in Indianapolis and went on to attend Bishop Chatard High School.  It was in her circle of friends there she met the love of her life, Johnny Francis McNamara, and she married at the young age of 20.  John and Erin became members of St. Luke Catholic Church of Indianapolis and started a family of their own.  They have four beautiful daughters.  Meghan is 22 and getting married in May of 2019, Courtney is 20 and is an esthetician, Delaney is 14 and a freshman at Highlands Latin School, and Maeve is 9 and is homeschooled.  Homeschooling has always been a large part of Erin’s life.  When she and John moved to the Fishers/Pendleton area in 2005, they joined St. John Vianney Parish of Fishers.  Erin eventually led the Homeschooling Ministry there for 2 years.   John is a Union Iron Worker in Local 22, working hard to provide for his family, often finding himself working away from home months at a time.  Distance does not separate the hearts of John and Erin as their love for each other is undeniable.  Erin has given 110% to her family over the years.   It was in February of 2017 when Erin decided to do something for herself.  She walked into Carmel Total Fitness gym for the first time.  “I was overweight and out of shape.”   Surrounded by her new tribe and under the guidance of her coach, Erin lost 30 pounds through weight lifting and improving her diet.   The gym didn’t just tweak Erin, it transformed her.   Erin was feeling healthier than ever!  Erin was now mentally, spiritually and physically fit as God was preparing her for something greater.   On May 7th of 2018, the course of life as the McNamara’s knew it would change.  At the young age of 43, Erin was diagnosed with Stage IV Colon Cancer that had metastasized to her liver. She immediately went into surgery where they removed a tumor along with a foot and a half of her colon.  Erin remained in the hospital for 12 days surrounded by loved ones.  Erin recovered beautifully from her surgery.  Her surgeon said that it was a good thing that she had lost the weight and got in shape because it helped her recover from surgery faster and he, along with her oncologist, encouraged her to continue lifting weights as it is important for her overall health. Prayers of thanksgiving John was able to take the summer off to take care of Erin and the two younger girls by means of a generous friend who supported them financially during that time. On June 14th, with her love by her side, Erin started chemotherapy to address the tumors on her liver.  After three chemo treatments the bills started to pile up and it was time for John to return to work….miles away.    Eighteen Weeks later, Erin has completed six cycles of chemotherapy.  This is not where her story ends, this is where her story begins.  At the completion of Erin’s last chemo treatment new scans were taken.  The oncologist reported her scans looked beautiful. There was no evidence of new growth and her tumors had responded to the chemo.  The scans showed shrinkage.  In the moment this is great news.  Keep reading. Erin’s oncologist shared with Erin that she would now enter “maintenance.”  This would consist of oral chemo daily and a non-chemo drug (Avastin).  Every 3 weeks Erin would receive Avastin through an IV for the reminder of her life as long as her body can tolerate it or when the cancer cells start to grow again whether that’s four, six or ten months down the road.  Erin would then need to return to IV chemo.  The goal is to “keep things in check”.   I don’t need to share the painful and serious side effects of chemo.  Her oncologist had politely whispered in her ear “Mrs. McNamara, you have Stage IV Colon Cancer that has metastasized…” during a previous treatment when Erin asked a question about her healing. This gave Erin the courage and strength to take a leap of faith.  Erin with the love and support of her family, made the decision to discontinue treatment.  She does not want to just exist, ERIN WANTS TO LIVE!  With the support of a dear friend, Erin will be traveling to the Hoxsey Bio Medical Clinic in Mexico on November 5th, 2018. This clinic specializes in natural alternative therapies for cancer.  Erin has found peace in this new hope.  She will be drastically changing her lifestyle to help promote wellness and healing.  Many of the alternative therapies Erin will be receiving are not covered by insurance.  Erin and John realize for her to be able to do this, they must let go of their pride and humble themselves and ask for help.  With their permission, I have organized this GO FUND ME campaign so that Erin can live.   She is ready to do this, God has been preparing her.  Erin knows Christ’s love, feels Christ’s love and may she continue to see His love in your support.  First and foremost, His grace is greater than all our sin.  Please pray for Erin for a complete healing.   May Erin always have strength in body, courage in spirit and patience in pain.  Pray for her family that they may have patience, understanding and a love that perseveres, not only for Erin, but for Christ.  Please pray that in their moments of weakness they will turn to Him.  May Erin’s family always trust there is victory over the enemy. Ultimately, we know who our true physician and healer is.  AMEN!  Second, please share Erin’s story.  I do believe that suffering unites our hearts with Jesus.  May you be called to offer up your own suffering not only for Erin but for all those suffering from incurable diseases.  Third, please pray John can find permanent employment that will best utilize his skill set in Indianapolis. Lastly Erin, John and the girls greatly appreciate any financial support for Erin on her journey.  No donation is to small or to great! Thank you for your prayers.  “Surrounded by love is a good place to be….”Dodi Poynter - Friend",164852fc372ca556a3ed9b855346ff43,71,0.476,60.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

We are the fortunate friends of Jane Schiowitz and we are ready to move mountains for our fierce pal as she fights brain cancer, but we need your help.Jane is a mom, a wife, a daughter, and a sister, but to us she is our creative, fun-loving, loyal friend whose infectious laugh fills any room. (Jane & her husband Rick Brooks)She is a gifted artist by trade and an amazing Mom to her teenage son.(Jane & her son Julian)
In early March 2018, Jane started having strange symptoms: facial spasms, numbness, and weakness on her left side.  An MRI revealed a tumor on the right side of her brain.  Living close to New York City, Jane was able to get exceptional medical care. Surgery on March 14 resulted in the removal of 95 percent of the tumor. While her surgery was successful, the type of cancer she has — glioblastoma — is aggressive and may come back. Within the next month, Jane will undergo intensive treatment, including radiation, chemotherapy and a clinical trial at Sloane-Kettering. This next phase of treatment is arduous and costly.



After digesting this news, we decided to create a GoFundMe page on her behalf. Jane has not been able to work since her diagnosis and will not be able to work throughout the course of her treatment, which will also create a significant financial hardship for her family. She will and has already incurred significant expenses due to her recent neurosurgery, hospital stay and rehabilitation. These medical expenses are adding up quickly and will be prohibitive.Jane’s wonderful spirit has touched so many people. We hope that we 


can raise $75,000 to help defray her medical costs and ease her family’s financial burden which will allow her to focus on beating cancer.You can keep up with her latest progress and share your well wishes on her Facebook page.We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for taking an interest in this very dear cause.   (Jane and her sister Nan)

Joseph Archie aged 3 was at daycare when his mother received the devastating news. Joseph's stomach appeared to be swollen on one side. Fabi Vera his mother took him to the doctor immediately. The pediatrician examined Joseph and told Fabi to take him immediately to Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago. Once there Doctors found a 7 inch cancerous tumor in his stomach. Joseph was diagnosed with stage IV Wilms Cancer. (There are only about 500 cases a year) On 1/16/19 Joseph went in for a very intensive 8 hour surgery where his kidney and tumor were removed. Doctors discovered that the cancer had spread to his lungs. On 1/22/19, Joseph started chemotherapy and will have a long road to recovery.  The family donated the tumor for study in their hope to save other children's lives. Joseph is always smiling, even after his surgery. He is a very happy and well mannered little boy.Fabi works as an independent contractor for a phone store and does not have insurance.  Fabi's work wants her to return ASAP and is not being compassionate about her family's current situation. Fabi also has a 2 year old son that has been staying with family so she can be with Joseph.  Fabi does not drive and does not have transportation to and from Chicago for weekly chemotherapy treatments.

Yo la conozco. He visto su increíble perseverancia al buscar trabajo, su pasión casi obstinada para aprender inglés (créanme, no hablaba una sola palabra) y la descomunal energía que tiene para lavar platos hasta altas horas de la madrugada, sabiendo que en pocas horas debe levantarse de nuevo a estudiar. Mari es fuerte, pero para enfrentar este reto necesita un poco de ayuda. Un pequeño empujón, no es más. Los médicos acaban de diagnosticarla con “carcinoma papilar de tiroides”, y según el dictamen está en Categoría VI, lo que quiere decir que tiene alto grado de malignidad y el procedimiento a seguir de acuerdo con los médicos, sería la remoción quirúrgica.Así es, estamos luchando contra el tiempo.Mari debe someterse a una cirugía llamada TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY + CENTRAL NECK DISSECTION lo antes posible, pues en este punto de la historia cada minuto, literalmente, es vital.Nunca, en ningún momento de nuestro viaje a Australia, esperamos vernos enfrentados a un reto como este (venimos a pasarlo bien ¿no?). Pero los problemas llegan y hay que ponerles el pecho; claro está, hacerlo es mucho más fácil si contamos con apoyo.Maricel dice todo el tiempo que su mayor preocupación es estar sola en este país, y necesitamos la ayuda de todos ustedes para demostrarle que no es así; que aunque su mamá está lejos, en Australia tiene una familia inmensa que está dispuesta a hacer lo que sea necesario para salvarle la vida. Hemos creado este fondo para ayudarle a costear los gastos de su tratamiento; pues aunque afortunadamente el seguro médico cubre el valor de la cirugía, Mari no puede volver a trabajar durante los próximos dos meses, lo que implica que no tendrá dinero para cubrir los gastos durante su proceso de recuperación (consultas médicas, medicinas, vivienda y alimentación).Básicamente queremos quitarle a Mari la preocupación de no tener trabajo en Australia (todos sabemos lo que significa eso), durante sus dos meses de convalecencia. ¡Queremos que se concentre en recuperarse!Si además del apoyo económico, tienes alguna otra forma de ayudarnos a que Mari supere esta dura prueba, te estaremos eternamente agradecidos.-----Mari’s story began just like anyone else who has come to this country, facing her fears and taking on new challenges to grow as a person. Nevertheless, Australia has been tougher on Mari than on most of us, and today she is facing what is perhaps the biggest challenge that anyone could ever face on this journey: a fight against cancer. But Mari is strong! I know her. I’ve seen her incredible determination at finding a job, her dogged passion to learn English (believe me, she couldn’t speak a word when she arrived) and the colossal energy she’s got for washing plates until even the wee hours of the morning, knowing that in just a few hours she would have to get up all over again to study. Mary is strong, but to face this challenge she needs a bit of help. Just a leg up, nothing more. Doctors have recently diagnosed her with papillary thyroid carcinoma, classified at stage 6, meaning it has a high degree of malignancy and that doctors have recommended surgical removal. Indeed, we are in a race against time. Mari must undergo an operation known as TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY + CENTRAL NECK DISSECTION as soon as possible. This late in the game, every minute, literally, is vital. Never, at any moment of our journey in Australia, do we ever expect to find ourselves staring down such a challenge (we’ve all come to have fun, right?). But problems pop up, and we have to give them all we’ve got. If anything’s clear, it’s that doing that is a lot easier when we have people to fall back on. Maricel always says that her biggest worry is being alone in this country, and we need the support of each and every one of you to show her that this isn’t the case; that although she may be far from home, in Australia she has a family that is willing to do whatever it takes to save her life. We have created this fund to help cover the costs of her treatment, since although her medical insurance fortunately covers the cost of the surgery, Mari will be unable to return to work for the following two months, meaning she will lack the money needed to cover her costs during the recovery process (medical appointments, medications, rent and food). Basically, we want to free Mari from the stress of not having a job in Australia (we all know what that’s like) during her two months of recuperation. We want her to focus on getting better! If, beyond just financial support, you have any other way to help Mari along through this difficult test, we will be eternally grateful.",2bb47a10d473048a8a4d0cb5c310e1ef,27,0.4385,7.0,4,0,0,1,1,1,1,0.0011299435028248588,0.0011299435028248588,0.5710895788016611,1.0,1.0,0,0,1,0,Both,gofundme

Then,  hopefully when a successful match is found, she will be back in the hospital for another 4-6 weeks for the bone marrow transplant. During this time, she will go through multiple blood transfusions, platelet transfusions and bone marrow biopsies.

Next few years were very hard.  We were living in a same house with two toddlers and three cancer patients.  We had to work together to manage our schedules for countless surgeries, chemotherapy, and radiations. After almost 3 years of chemotherapy and I am cancer free.  ￼￼￼￼￼￼Unfortunately, my parents’ cancer came back. My mom’s breast cancer had spread to 7 different tumors and her liver.  Her oral pain medication is no longer working. My dad’s cancer had spread to his spine, pelvis and legs.  ￼￼￼My parents were hard workers. They owned dry cleaners in Westfield for 25 years.   I grew up watching parents help others in need. My mom volunteered to record college textbooks for blinds, helping disabled, and homeless.  I could not understand why people like my parents were suffering from such a horrible disease.  Now they are truly fighting for their lives.  Till now we were just fighting to be cancer free    We believed that our lives were never in jeopardy till now.  They are more worried about my kids’ future than themselves right now. Just like how all the parents are in this world. They were driving each other to treatments to Hackensack hospital before but now it has become too difficult for them to drive and takes Uber most of the time. It tortures me to watch them struggle when I cant do anything for them.     ￼￼￼     Because our cancer we lost our house and 25 years old business in Westfield. I am asking for help so that they can concentrate on their treatments. Thank you.",e513a7160b566a32ecbe52d2e074b13e,37,0.59052,30.0,5,1,0,3,0,2,0,0.006134969325153374,0.0,0.1893238434163701,5.382142012021615,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

He has had a total of 8 surgeries on his eyes to try to prevent further vision loss and blindness. Two of those surgeries occurred last year. He has to have costly injections in his eyes regularly ($1,500 per eye every 2-3 months) and has not been able to drive for many months. Because of his vision problems he is no longer able to work. Even with the best specialists available, they are still unable to determine what is causing continual damage to his optic nerves and continuing to cause permanent vision loss.Judy works full-time and is their primary financial provider and only driver. In May, Jon was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer.In June, Judy was diagnosed with Breast Cancer.In August, Jon underwent prostate removal surgery.Judy’s cancer is aggressive, and she started on chemo right away. She just completed her last round of chemo, and she is scheduled for surgery in November. After surgery, she will begin radiation for 5-6 weeks. Following radiation she will continue with very costly ($4800/per treatment) targeted drug therapy every 3 weeks for about another year. Thankfully they do have medical insurance, but even with that they have exhausted all of their savings with out of pocket costs and expenses.  Judy has continued to work full time even through cancer treatment. It is necessary in order for them to have income and also to maintain health insurance.  They live a modest lifestyle within their financial means, and as they look toward the New Year they recognize that their portion of patient responsibility for insurance will be reset and they will need to quickly be able to come up with enough money to pay deductibles and make co-payments for their necessary treatments.They would wholeheartedly agree that the most powerful way we can support them is through prayer! Please join us in praying for Jon & Judy!  And for those who feel led, please consider helping them in a practical way by making a financial contribution.  Every little bit helps, and by joining together small contributions can add up to make a big difference for Jon & Judy!",f9c9d69b6392a7dadc7dcee14c9ed799,20,0.74125,60.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

In fact her cancer tumor has grown and she has developed a mass on her liver.  We are running out of options.

The first round of testing is about $7,000.00 which is not covered by our insurance. While this test won't save her life, there is a small chance that it will find a treatment that could give her more time to spend with our family.

I live in Los Angeles, but travel to Armenia often to help families in need and wounded soldiers. However, last September, during a visit to Armenia for my usual charity work, I was taken to the pediatric oncology department in one of the local hospitals. There, I was introduced to a number of cancer patients (as old as 17, but most of them under the age of 12.) It was heartbreaking to see these young souls whose skin was tainted by radiation and who’s hair have all fallen out because of the Chemotherapy they were receiving. In addition, 90% of the children in that hospital travel from villages outside of Yerevan (the capital of Armenia.)The scene was surreal, and no parent should ever have to or experience what I witnessed. In the United States, people from underprivileged households can get free cancer treatments. However, in countries such as Armenia, there are no such programs. An average income is approximately 2000 dram (+/- $4.12) per day. Yet one course of Chemo is $700-$1000 (depending on the hospital.) Incredibly, even fever medication and antibiotics are out of reach for these families.Upon my return from that trip, I organized multiple fundraisers and collected a considerable amount of funds to pay for the desperately needed chemo. I used the funds to sponsor the children who needed the most urgent care. However, at the rate of $1000 per child, the funds quickly ran out.Disbursement: Once the campaign is completed, I will withdraw the funds and I will send them to Armenia personally. Additionally, I normally travel there every few months for a few weeks each time. As per previous fundraisers, I will take most of the money there myself. However, for immediate needs, a local money transfer company (much like Western Union) has offered to transfer the money raised here on GoFundMe.com to Armenia at no cost to this fundraiser. This, of course, is a huge savings. Once the transfer is completed, two of my associates in Armenia will collect the funds and make the necessary arrangements. (I.e. purchasing medications, paying medical bills at the hospitals, etc.) This is all done with the parents as witnesses, once they have given us permission and the necessary prescriptions. The medications are then given directly to the hospital staff (in certain cases, the medication is purchased at the hospital.) This is the only way we can ensure that no child will have to suffer due to financial constraints.I want to continue sponsoring the children and I need your help to do so.

The doctors in Poland have done everything in their power to save Justyna, unfortunately, conventional medicine in Poland was helpless after the cancer unexpectedly came back in 2015. In the late 2016, Justyna's condition was worsening dramatically with every day that has passed.  The tumor had spread into the spinal cord. This time the chemo did not help and with the growth of the tumor Justyna had lost ability to walk. We are in the process of treating our last chance! A brain tumor is a terribly difficult opponent, which is why this fight is extremely demanding. However, had Justyna remained in Poland, there would be no question of a fight because she would not be with us anymore. The medicine there is helpless. Fortunately, Justyna is a fighter. She continues to fight and will not give up and until the cancer finally gives up. Thanks to people with generous hearts, Justyna is still alive. In April she flew to a clinic in Monterrey, Mexico - the one remaining place that gave her hope to save her. Tumors in the core have largely decreased and there is continuing hope that they will completely disappear. Justyna has been given chemo through the femoral artery to the spinal cord and through the Ommaya reservoir directly to the head, because detailed diagnostics showed that the tumor is there.  In addition to cancer, there is one more enemy - the passage of time. By February 4, we have to pay for the next cycle of chemotherapy, for which we have no money. Then for the next cycle after that ... We are afraid to think about what will happen if we do not make our goal. The cancer will not wait, it will not give us more time.This is why, Justyna, family and friends are asking for your generosity again.   To all those who do not know me. My name is Kazimierz Szymanski and I am Justyna's uncle. I live with my family in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. All the proceeds from your generous donations will be send directly to Justyna and her mother Anna Drag to help them with medical expenses while continuing treatment at the clinic in Monterrey, Mexico. I have set up weekly withdrawals from GoFundMe account into a personal account and later the money will be wired to Justyna's and her mom's account in Poland. If you would like a proof of the withdrawals and wire transfers please contact me in private and I will be happy to provide you with this information. The photo below is of Justyna showing proof that indeed I am her uncle and that I am authorized to collect donations on her behalf. Justyna with her parents visiting us before flying back to Poland for Christmas.Again, we cannot thank you enough.  All of us are overwhelmed by the support and generosity that Justyna continues to receive every day.

The combination of chemo and the injections come with many difficult side effects that Lianne endures on a daily basis as she takes care of her son and herselfwhile trying to keep things as normal as possible at home.We have found after much research and guidance from the social worker at the Cancer Clinic that there is very little funding available and Lianne’s employer did not have long term leave benefits.  Employment Insurance sick leave is only 15 weeks.  The week before she found the lump, she had set appts to add critical illness to her life insurance policy but was denied by her new carrier as they considered her to have a pre-existingcondition as there was a lump found.  The same thing happened when she tried to utilize the disability insurance she pays for on her vehicle.

Leah is the mother of 4 kind, outstanding children; they were all raised in our community since they were babies and their father has taken care of the Sephardic Synagogue for nearly decades. Inevitably this extreme circumstance will take a huge toll on Moti, the father, and he is planning on doing whatever is necessary to take off work and be there for the children and for Leah throughout her treatment and recovery.  It is hard to believe that this is happening to Leah. We are devastated by this sudden news. The Moryosef family has been living in San Diego for 18 years now. This is the longest that Leah has lived anywhere.

It is our hope that Leah and her family should have to be concerned with one thing only and that is Leah's path through treatment and recovery. We are asking for your support to assist with impending medical expenses, living expenses, basic necessities and unexpected expenses. We understand that this is a large amount of money to raise in a short time  but due to the rapid speed in which the cancer is growing we must act now. Leah’s life depends on it and the future of her children depend on it. Because everything is happening so fast Leah should be expected to undergo chemotherapy very soon. She is currently very busy scheduling appointments to see where else the cancer has spread amongst other doctors appointments. Leah is a devoted mother, a professional speech pathologist, an amazing Opera singer, an overall radiant and intelligent woman but most importantly she is a kind and gentle spirit.   Leah wants everyone to know that since this reality has unfolded she has found a greater appreciation for every sacred moment in life.She is committed to her family, her community and her career and she is fiercely determined to live a full life. Anyone who knows Leah can attest to her strength and will and they know that she will work as hard as humanly possible to beat the odds!Leah has quite a road to treatment and recovery ahead of her and everyday she is facing new obstacles.

My name is Caroline and on May 14, 2018, I woke up to the discovery of a tumor after a routine colonoscopy. A few tests and a little over a week later, I was officially diagnosed with Stage IV colorectal cancer. Please Help MeI’m on my own and have scarce support from my family. My beloved mother died of breast cancer 32 years ago and her death devastated us. For the past few weeks, I’ve been in a lot of pain and unable to do even the most basic of day-to-day chores. Up until recently, I’d been trying to handle almost everything myself. The treatment for this type of cancer takes about a year or so. I am unable to work, and will not be able to work for, at least, another eight or nine months, if all goes well.Asking for any kind of help, especially for money, is difficult. The recent fires, natural disasters, mass shootings and perpetual social causes, has had me questioning if I’m worthy of even asking you for help. It’s taken me months to get the courage and it’s required me to confront the urgent need that I’m in. So here I am, buckling down to share my story, in the hope that you will think my life and my cause are worthy of your compassion and generosity. Would you please make a donation to help me fight this war against cancer?  No amount is too small and I am grateful that you’re reading this and considering it. With your donations, I hope to be able to cover my basic living and health expenses for the next year and pay down part of my growing medical debt. Would you also please share my story with your acquaintances, friends and family who might be inclined to help me? I’d appreciate it.How It StartedThe only warning signs I had about the cancer was a change in bowel movements. I explored possible causes: gluten-intolerance, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, depression, peri-menopause, maybe even a parasite (I had eaten unwashed lettuce in a sandwich at the local farmer’s market.) It wasn’t until my OB/GYN suggested I get a colonoscopy that I started on the path to learning the truth. I was turning 50, it was time to get one anyway.  I put it off for several months (and I’m ashamed of this),  because the preparation and procedure sounded yucky. In all my months of doctors visits trying to figure this out, no doctor had suggested I might have cancer. I’m one of the healthiest people you’ll ever meet. Even now, if you saw me on the street, you wouldn’t know that I’m battling such a beast. All of this was a massive shock.How Am I Feeling Right Now?  I'm happy to be done with radiation and the oral chemo, but the pain and side effects have been compounding. I'm very uncomfortable, and have just been trying to rest and manage the pain. I’ve been advised that I should start to feel better in a couple more weeks. Still…I’m afraid. I’m afraid to ask for money. I’m afraid I won’t receive what I need to maintain my basic needs, never mind my medical bills. I’m afraid I will be shamed and criticized for needing to ask for help.I’m afraid I will never feel really healthy again.I’m afraid I’ll never teach Bikram yoga again.I’m afraid I’ll never travel again. I’m afraid I’ll never experience desire, passion and romantic love again. I’m afraid I won’t be able to pursue the dreams I’ve buried for decades and have only recently unearthed. I’m afraid you’ll laugh at me if I tell you about my dreams for my future, post-cancer.I’m afraid you’re comparing my story to Becoming by Michelle Obama and will find me lacking. I’m afraid you’ll want to come visit me and I won’t be able to hold my fart in.I’m afraid you won’t want to be around me because I have cancer.I’m afraid that over time more and more friends will drift away because this is HARD.I’m afraid I won’t be able to overcome this battle with cancer.I’m afraid but I also have so much hope. I am fighting hard to stay optimistic and positive, because I deeply believe in the power of positive thinking.I believe that cancer is my teacher and that as I fight to eradicate it from my body, I am also to learn life-changing lessons from it. What's The Game Plan? The primary tumor is in my rectum and it’s metastasized to both of my lungs. On June 28th, I began the first of six rounds of chemotherapy (FOLFOX) infusions and completed them in September. On November 12th, I completed 28 days of radiation treatment with oral chemotherapy, which took place over a course of six weeks.I’ll see my radiation oncologist this Monday for a follow-up, and then meet with my oncologist in early December to discuss the next steps. There will be more tests and scans. There will surely be meetings with my oncology surgeon. The tentative plan is to have my first surgery in January to remove the primary tumor in my rectum. A couple of months after that, I’ll have a second surgery to resect my colon and have the tumors in my lungs removed. There will be more chemotherapy infusions. The first time I met my oncologist, she told me that she sees me and my cancer as curable, based on my overall health. If you look at statistics, that puts me in a small percentage. Colorectal cancer is on the rise around the world, so funding and research has increased, and breakthroughs are being made all the time. I also believe in my health care team, my overall good health (despite the cancer) and my resolve to fight cancer and win. Depression and CancerI was severely depressed for almost two years before I was diagnosed with cancer. It began with a relationship that ended violently and it blindsided me. As I began to attempt to pick up the pieces, there were two consecutive, separate, abusive employers who took advantage of my vulnerability at different stages. Finally there was the realization that I could no longer support myself in the yoga teaching career I loved and had invested ten years into. Each of those things drove me deeper and deeper into depression. It is a miracle to me that I survived those days, and I owe that to friends near and far.Almost exactly a year ago, I had started to re-discover myself through improvisation classes and then later, a writing class. These two creative activities along with my yoga practice gave me some breaks from depression and started to kindle a sense of self-worth within me.How ironic it was to start to come out of that black hole of depression to learn that I had cancer. It was in that same week that I realized that if I had survived so many suicidal thoughts, I was not going to let myself die from cancer. Still, nothing prepares you for how hard this treatment is and I still struggle trying to stay out of that abyss.Looking AheadWhen I am cancer free, I hope to find meaningful work that can support me. I am probably going to have to find a new career, which is daunting when you're over 50. I also hope to be able to give back to the community that has supported me. I would like to advocate for patients like me, who are fighting cancer on their own. I've been invited by one of my nurses to help their hospital improve their patient care, by sharing my experiences. I hope to see friends and enjoy meals with them. I hope to be able to travel and have more adventures. I want to fall in love again and be truly loved. I want to pursue my dreams of writing and acting. Most of all, I'll be so grateful to be and feel healthy again. Thank you.",27e163cf04b644cc5749f7ceeb0a127a,69,0.2189111111111111,60.0,6,1,0,8,0,6,0,0.005661712668082095,0.0,0.16810285870605937,14.84952423161745,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

I have stage 4 colon cancer that has moved into most of my liver. Today we found out the treatments aren't working. The tumors are growing and they have found new ones. They're changing up the treatments and we're praying the change will help. I was told they don't want perform any surgery on me until we're showing progress. Unless things get worse and they don't have a choice. I have lost almost 40 pounds since early December when the treatments started. I'm having constant pains that come and go and don't sleep well. We have already started reducing our expenditures and made concessions with Capital One to help with the stress. Right now we're in a good place staying with my parents but it gets tight with the four of us living in the same room. Before I got sick, things were great with work and we had a possible opportunity to move to Sacramento, get our own place; something we were working hard for. Right now we're just trying to get by and we need help. I really hate having to ask for it. Right now, we'd like to get our Subaru fixed to try and get us up to the snow. It needs a new rack(steering), CV joint, struts, and tires. I messaged Subaru today in hopes they might help with the repairs. It still gets me around town and to the hospital when we need it, but I can't trust it to get us up to Tahoe. Tahoe is a place that has always grounded me and brought me lots of joy and peace over the years. We have season passes we payed into over last summer and fall but I don't always feel well and getting up there is hard. I am constantly dealing with having to go to the restroom and it's hard when others offer to drive us because canceling on them at the last minute sucks if I don't feel well, or if we have to leave early so I can clean myself up. I can't stress how hard writing this is for me right now. We have other debts we have been working on and until recently with me needing to step down from work, things were great and on track. But what worries me is if things get even worse, I don't want me or my family having to worry about the bills we still have. I would also use the money for therapeutic oncology massages. A good friend spend two hours driving to give me one and I felt amazing afterwards. I really do not want people to feel they have to donate or share this.

She was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer after she was rushed by ambulance to the ER at Valley Medical Center in Renton with severe stomach pain. She underwent her first of 2 surgeries on New Year's Eve to remove multiple tumors. A second surgery was performed on Tuesday, January 2nd. Lauren remained in the hospital until she recovered from her surgeries.Lauren began a grueling regimen of chemo which showed continual shrinkage of her tumor markers such that a surgery was done the second week of October of 2018 believing there was a possibility that all the cancer could be removed as well as a reversal of her colostomy along with repair of a hernia she had developed could be done. Disappointingly, only a few peritoneal cancer tumors could be removed because there were minute cancer areas that did not show up on the scan as they were too small to be seen. Doctors at this time felt they could go no further. This was a devastating development as Lauren, her family, and friends have been fighting for a cure. Lauren has taken all of the chemotherapy treatments recommended and the tumor markers show continued shrinkage.  After receiving the devastating news, Lauren did some research and sought out the opinion of a surgeon in Baltimore who is known to perform the Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy procedure (HIPEC). HIPEC is a cancer treatment that involves filling the abdominal cavity with chemotherapy drugs that have been heated. Also known as “hot chemotherapy,” HIPEC is performed after the surgeon removes tumors or lesions from the abdominal area. After consulting with the surgeon, Lauren flew to Baltimore to see if the procedure was an option for her. The surgeon performed a scope of her abdominal cancer on Monday, January 21, 2019 to determine if he would be able to do the surgery. He has given the go ahead and will be performing the surgery on February 14th.Brandon and Lauren will need to fly back to Baltimore for the surgery and it has been determined Lauren will be in the hospital for at least three weeks. As you might imagine, the financial burden of this will be overwhelming because neither Brandon nor Lauren will be able to work. Lauren will need extensive time off to recover and heal from this invasive procedure. As before, please continue with your prayers, but also if you are able to help out monetarily, it would help relieve some of the substantial stress this life threatening disease has already caused in their lives.",d93532a134aab63b9c01e8e60c841ea6,18,0.342,3.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

When not working at a local law firm or spending time with his family, Mike is an accomplished drummer, avid foodie, basketball enthusiast, and photographer.In March 2015 he was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia with FLT3 mutation. After being in remission from his first battle with cancer, he is now undergoing treatment again. His projected treatment plan currently includes chemo at a hospital near his home followed by trips from Las Vegas to the City of Hope in California for additional treatment. He will require a bone marrow transplant as due to his particular mutation he is unable to rely on his own bone marrow. In order to be able to receive the bone marrow transplant, Mike will have to be in remission. Once this milestone is achieved and the transplant occurs in California, Mike and his family will have to stay in California for 2-3 months to ensure that the transplant is completely successful. Participation in a clinical trial may also be required.Throughout Mike’s treatment he will obviously not be able to work and earn his typical income. In addition, travel expenses to/from and while in California will accumulate quickly.

Add to that the medical bills that will flood in and you are left with a sense of how difficult it will be for them to support their family.The road ahead is potentially long and winding, but Mike has an incredibly positive attitude and is determined to kick cancer’s ass! Through the grace of employers, family, friends, and others in the community Mike was able to put all of his energy towards a healthy physical recovery the first time. It is more crucial now than before for us to rally around him and his family financially so that they can keep their focus on his recovery physically.

She underwent surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation in her treatment. Following treatment she was given a clear diagnosis.  Against all odds her dreams came true when she found out she was pregnant. Her daughter Jordynn was born October 1st, 2014. They were later surprised when Becky became pregnant for the 2nd time. They had a boy named Cohen March 14th, 2016. In the Spring of 2017 Becky hurt her back at work and was diagnosed with an injury to her discs in her back. The injury continued to get worse and last week on August 25th, 2017, she was told she had cancer to her spine following a bone scan. She was referred to the Cross Cancer Institute September 1st, after testing and meeting with a Dr. there she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. Becky has several spots of cancer along her spine and liver. The Dr's there could not provide an accurate prognosis but based on similar cases they estimate a 2 year survival term. Becky and Bob have decided to explore alternate options that have had promising results and are unfortunately not available in Canada and are not covered by healthcare.  They have booked to flights to Arizona and have a consultation with a clinic there and are exploring aternatives in Tijuana as well that may be able to provide some hope for them.

In the original post I had been diagnosed with stage 4 cervical cancer. I was fighting the cancer & I did 4 rounds of radiation therapy along with 9 rounds of chemotherapy. After the 6th round of chemotherapy my gynecologist oncologist had me do a pet scan. This was going to be my first pet scan after doing my radiation and chemotherapy. This scan was basically going to show if the chemo and radiation worked at all. I didn’t have much hope because I was told I was given only a 10% chance to live. The tumor on top of my right cervix was the size of my fist (about 11cmx8cm all the way around). I had death set in my mind & I was terrified of the results. Much to my surprise the results were great. The tumor had shrunk so much that they could barely see it on the screen. Since this was after my 6th chemo session, my doctor ordered 3 more sessions so we could try and nip the tumor in the bud. My doctor said that my body had responded so well to the chemo & being young didn’t hurt either. After the 9th session my doctor ordered another pet scan. This time I felt a bit more hopeful, but still had the thought of death in the back of my mind. The results came back and I was in remission. He said that the tumor was gone and I was cancer free. I was so happy I started crying & finally had some hope for my future. I asked my doctor what the next step is. He said there was this new drug called Keytruda aka Pembrolizumab. He said that it’s a good thing to take after chemo, a great post cancer medication. He said the success rates were high & that he believed in it & I should take it. My doctor saved my life before my choosing the right amount of radiation, the right chemo meds & premeds, so why wouldn’t I trust his judgement? I excitedly agreed and told him I was game. He said that he wanted to do 10 sessions (3 weeks apart) from each other. What Keytruda is supposed to do is strengthen the immune system so it can target any new cancer cells & basically stop new cancer cells from growing. It also helps with your white blood cell count. This sounded amazing so I couldn’t wait to get started. The problem was my insurance wasn’t covering it and each session was $10,000 & my doctor was requesting 10. That means I would’ve needed to shell $100,000. Keytruda seemed like a lifesaver & a great post cancer treatment & the success rates were high, so I was determined to make this happen for me. That’s when I originally started this gofundme. The original goal point was past $100,000. Thankfully my great nurse at UCI Medical was able to speak to my insurance and they agreed to cover my sessions which was a huge relief to me because I thought there was no way in hell I was going to be able to raise $100k. It took a few weeks to start my treatment. It was just like my chemotherapy where I did a session every 3 weeks. After my 6th session that I did on my 1/5/19, I had my next pet scan set up for 1/11/19. I was very scared because this was going to be my first pet scan after doing Keytruda for 6 months. This scan would determine if I was still cancer free or not, and it would also determine if the Keytruda has been working or not. I was beyond terrified and my anxiety was through the roof for over a week about this scan. I did my scan on 1/11/19 and got my results at my gynecologist oncologist appointment on 1/14/19. I sat in the room with Paul (thank goodness he took the day off work so he can be with me and support me) and about 4 other doctors besides my main doctor and nurse came in. I sat there dying waiting for them to pull the image of my scan up. There was a yellow circle to the left of where my original tumor was, about an inch over my belly button. My doctor said that the yellow circle was a new tumor. And then he basically said that I have cancer again & that I am going to be stopping Keytruda immediately because it wasn’t working for me. So many emotions washed over me as I sat there in disbelief. I was angry, sad, dazed, freaking out, tuning everything out, I just wanted to run. The good news is that we caught the tumor early & that it is waaaaaay smaller than my first tumor. This tumor is 12mm & one of the doctors compared it to the size of my pinky nub. So since we caught the tumor early & the tumor was smaller I asked my doctor if the stage of my cancer was different. He said no, that the stage will always be the same. So unfortunately I still have stage 4 cervical cancer. I will be taking new chemo drugs, and fortunately these won’t make me lose my hair. There is a small percentage of course, but my doctor said it’s very small. If anything my hair will thin so I will get vitamins and shampoo and hair stuff for that. I will be getting a phone call from my nurse sometime this week with details about my chemotherapy. The plan is 3 sessions, but the way the sessions work is kind of weird. 1 session is throughout a period of 3 consecutive days. Each day I go in and it’s a 6 hour long period. After the 3rd day the session is done. I have to do that 3 times every 3 weeks. After the third session is done I will be doing another pet scan to see if the cancer has spread, shrunk, disappeared, or if I need more chemo. This time around the chemo meds I will be taking are called: Carboplatin and Topotecan. Now since I am unemployed and have been for almost 3 years now, most of you can see that I’m not in the best financial situation. I do get disability from the government, but that barely covers my HOA payment, electric bill (yes I’m in the CARE program, but my bills still come out to $30-40), cell phone bill, monthly necessities (ie: toilet paper, paper towels, napkins, etc), food and kitty litter for my 3 legged cat Calvin, and groceries. I do have food stamps but the amount I get barely covers 2 weeks worth of food (if that) and I barely eat... if you know me then you know how skinny I am. I am thankful that I have government assistance, but unfortunately it doesn’t cover everything. I am also trying to pay back my property tax/back taxes on my condo. As I mentioned earlier my mother left me her condo in her inheritance when she passed away in 2013 from colon cancer. When I had a job I was able to cover both the HOA and the property tax. Since losing my job I was barely able to keep my head above water and was only able to pay the HOA. I haven’t been able to pay my property tax that has now become back taxes since 2016. I am on a slow route to losing my home, my only asset, the only thing my mother has left me. The donations from this campaign will go directly to either paying off all the taxes (depending on how much they are, OR putting a down payment so foreclosure stops & I will be making payments). I have such great friends and you guys are the majority of my donations. I want to thank you guys from the bottom of my heart because without you guys I wouldn’t have any donations. As most of you know I don’t have any family members to fall back on to help me financially. My father passed away from a heart attack when I was 16, and my mother passed away from colon cancer when I was 23. I am 29 now... this cancer nightmare started for me when I was 27. I was 27 when I was diagnosed with stage 4 cervical cancer aka “Endocervical Adenocarcinoma”. I also found out I was anemic & that my hemoglobin (blood level) was at a 3. A normal woman my age at the time (27) should have a hemoglobin of a 12 or 13. I was dangerously underweight, I am 5”8 and I was 89lbs. I had to undergo around 6 blood transfusions to get me back to normal. I was in the ICU for over a week. Then I was transported to 4 different hospitals. I was in the hospital system for over a month (11/12/17 - 12/22/17). I missed Thanksgiving, my 28th bday (Dec 8), and almost Xmas. I didn’t even have a cell phone at the time so I was all alone. It was a hard decision for me to make a gofundme because I literally thought that everyone on the face of the earth either didn’t like me, or didn’t care that I had cancer. I’m so glad that I overcame that fear and made this page because I proved myself wrong & so many of you guys have donated, some multiple times. This makes me sooooooo happy. I do have to apologize for one thing though... I apologize that I am constantly posting my campaign all the time. I apologize that I am constantly asking for donations. There is a reason behind it though, the reason is that you guys are literally all I have. Like I said I have absolutely no family. Even the family I have left which is my half brother and half sister, I was taken full advantage of by them. They took advantage of my sickness. They tried to reap all of the benefits that I was receiving. They were stealing money from me and lying to me. They made a personal “debt” that I owe them for what they did for me before I started receiving benefits. My half sister and brother literally kept every single receipt they spent on me and put them all into an excel sheet. For example I had a full functioning working microwave. For some reason, without me asking them, they bought me a new microwave. Then boom $70 into the excel sheet. I was grateful that they bought me a new microwave, but I was under the impression that they did it out of the kindness of their heart. Another example, they bought me a new toaster oven. Didn’t have one, but didn’t want one or ask for one. Another $80 into the excel sheet. Then once my benefits rolled in each month my sister took out $200 out of my benefits before transferring the rest of my benefits into my account. She set up a joint account where I had a debit card. I had no access to the website & if I went to the bank I was denied any information because that’s how my half sister set it up. She lied on documents, she impersonated me, that’s how she got my benefits and other things for me. Then she spoke with a lawyer. She told the lawyer that she was speaking on behalf of me and they wrote up a contract. The contract was for me to agree to selling my condo to her. I read the contract and something smelled extremely fishy so I told her that I would have to read it again & maybe speak with someone else who understands the lawyer language better. Every person I showed the contract to laughed and basically asked if it was a joke. Everyone advised me not to sign it. I told my sister that I wasn’t going to sign the contract and because of that I was getting punished. Starting that month instead of taking $200 from my benefits before receiving them, she started taking $300. This went on for a few months before i mustered up the strength to speak to someone because I was scared of my half sister. She literally had so much power over me, she controlled every aspect of my life. I felt powerless under her & she made me feel that way too. Later I learned that she was committing grand larceny, conspiracy, impersonation, lying, and she is now getting investigated by the federal government. I no longer speak to my half brother either because he was also in cahoots with my half sister. The only other family I have that I speak to are my 3 cousins. We are all around the same age. I’m not going to use names out of privacy. I have my oldest cousin “J” and she is 30, then there’s “S” and she’s 29 (she’s 2 weeks older than me), then there’s me 29, and then there’s “H” and she’s 27. I asked all 3 of them to donate and I didn’t expect them to donate $100 or something, but I expected them to donate something because we are family and they know they’re all I have. “J” said she couldn’t because she had just moved to Florida & just got a job. Yet I see her on social media & she’s constantly eating out, drinking beer, going out, getting coffee. I think to myself “you really couldn’t spare $5-10 for your dying cousin?”. Then there was “H”, she said she couldn’t donate for the same reason pretty much, and she’s doing basically the same thing as “J”, going out, eating out, going to bars, etc. I had the same thought “you’re doing all these things & claim you’re broke, you really couldn’t spare $5-10?”. What surprised me the most is “S”. When I asked her about donating her answer was the most baffling. She said that she didn’t feel comfortable donating because she thinks that people who use gofundme for donations are basically the same as people begging for money on the side of the freeway. I was beyond appalled when she said that. She and I got into an argument about that and then she proceeded to block me on all social media & on the phone. So that’s my family for you. All my aunts and uncles are either passed on, or I haven’t seen them in 10+ years and don’t have their phone numbers. All my mom’s side of the family lives in Korea & I have no contact with them. The last time I spoke with my uncle who is actually a really successful businessman (he helped my mom buy this condo for me) said I was a disgrace to the family because I have yet to visit my moms grave in Korea. She passed away in Korea and was getting her cancer treatment in Korea because she couldn’t afford to here in the US, so my uncle took care of her. The thing he doesn’t understand is 1) I would LOVE to go visit my family in Korea, I haven’t been since I was 10 years old. 2) I don’t have a passport and I don’t know where my birth certificate is (my mom had all my documents, I even had to file to get a new social security card). 3) There is no way I can afford a round trip ticket to Korea (he is not willing to help pay). 4) I don’t know Korean and it will be hard to navigate myself without an interpreter, I can barely navigate around the US because I’m bad with directions. 5) I would have nowhere to stay while in Korea. 6) I am now sick and have been for over a year so I cannot leave the country. If my uncle were willing to help me of course I would be there. Anyways, I know that was very long, but I just had to explain to you guys my family situation & the intensity of it. You guys, my wonderful friends are my family. And that’s why I have to keep campaigning to you guys because I don’t have a larger audience. Thank you to everyone who has donated and to the people who have donated multiple times, and to the the people who have shared my campaign link so others can see/read my story. Closing, please donate if you can. The campaign will be up until the goal is met. Any amount is appreciated and will help me to reach my overall goal. One of my 2019 goals is to reach my campaign goal by the end of the year. I’m hoping sooner than later. If you absolutely cannot donate, PLEASE share my campaign link! It is proven that sharing works & it spreads my voice and message to people I cannot reach. That would be much appreciated. I know that this was extremely long so I will end it with this note: if you are reading this today please be selfless and make a donation of any size. Instead of buying that cup of coffee at Starbucks drink coffee at home & donate instead. Instead of going out to eat for lunch or dinner, eat at home & donate instead. Instead of going out to the bar and wasting money on overpriced cocktails or beer, drink at home instead & donate. Please keep that in mind and do a good deed today! I sure could use all the help that I can get, thank you from the bottom of my heart!!!-Liz (ORIGINAL POST) —thought I would leave it here so people can see. Hi everyone! My name is Liz and I’m a 29 year old cervical cancer survivor. I originally made this gofundme to raise money for Keytruda which is a new medication that my doctor wanted me to take to stay in remission. It isn’t covered by insurance because it’s so new. I also was raising money to pay back my taxes on my condo which I inherited from my mother who passed away from colon cancer back in 2013. I haven’t been able to pay my taxes due to unemployment, mental disabilities, and my sickness. I owe from 2016-now. I am updating the main page today (7/24/18) because my wonderful doctors and nurses talked to my insurance and got me approved for Keytruda! I am approved for 5-6 infusions, and then they will work to get me the rest of the infusions. My doctor wants me to do 10 in total. I am still going to be accepting donations to help pay back my taxes and for healing and basic living. In those areas I still need help and would appreciate all of it! It would mean the world to me if you still think I am worthy of a donation. I am still unemployed and need lots of help with living costs. Thank you all so much for your support!! It means the world to me!UPDATE 8/9/18I have finally set up my beneficiary for my funding, and of course I chose Paul. He is connected to me because I trust him and we share a bank account and also because he has been my rock and support throughout my journey. I would be nowhere without him. He has been keeping me positive and sane throughout this whole cancer journey. We have a joint account at School’s First Credit Union and he is the main one on the account where I am the joint and he is the only one with the savings account.

Maelle, his 6 year old daughter, is his everything, from the time he drops her off to school until he tucks her in at night.  He is a devoted son and grandson and is loved by all his friends and anyone who has had the pleasure of meeting him.  After going through an unfortunate divorce and rebuilding a life for Maelle and himself, to everyone's shock, Allen, 31 years young was diagnosed with stomach cancer.  After months of suffering through chemotherapy and radiation treatments in preperation for a procedure that would ultimatley remove the cancer (and his whole stomach), new growths beyond his stomach were found and doctors in Canada deemed him inoperable. His condition was labeled terminal and he was given 6 months to live. The main thing on his mind is that he would no longer be around to care for his daughter.

I would like to give y’all a small introduction to fill in the blanks which lead me to creating this account. 

 February 16, 2017– it’s a week after I have delivered my first child, and my 24th birthday..I had a boy! Which was exactly what what we wanted..I’m at a follow up visit thinking nothing of it, and I feel like I’m having a twilight zone moment, as I’m listening to my doctor explain that the large mass that started growing on my hip during pregnancy turn out to be cancer; a rare form related to pregnancy. “Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma” is what he called it. 

 My entire life has been a rollercoaster ever since. Fast forward to find out it’s stage 4, eating at my hip bones and spread to my lungs. Over the course of a year and a half I have endured chemo, and 3 surgery like procedures already to help shrink the mass in my hip. It causes major discomfort and pain, whether I sit, stand or lay due to the tumor suffocating my sciatic nerve. Even though I had to unenroll from school, I was still enjoying every bit of motherhood, and attempting to adult as best as I could. 

This upcoming Wednesday, November 14, 2018, I will be having a major surgery to go in and remove the original growth in my hip . We’re finally here! It seems like a long time coming. This surgery has been a topic of discussion since I received the initial diagnosis. But we received the news at such short notice, I basically was given a week to prep for surgery!! This morning I received a call to finalize the details of the surgery. Time, location, etc...but I was also informed of a copay that I truly cannot afford at such short notice.  I’m asking for the help of my community, extended love from friends of friends and the grace of complete strangers, if they could donate to help me reach my goal to help cover the cost of my procedure.",ca14f35f93bfe1cf427e3aefd9fc2f6d,18,1.02,60.0,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

UPDATE 1: Elise Fights Cancer

A recent biopsy indicates Elise has a diagnosis of Triple Negative Breast Cancer.


This is a highly aggressive and abnormal breast cancer for which there is no targeted treatment yet.


This community sourcing of resources is our way to help ensure we have all the necessary tools in our grasp to pave the future forward for fully funding Elise's complete treatment to tackle her cancer. 


We are exploring all types of available treatment options, with full health as our goal, your support is incredibly appreciated and our gratitude for you is boundless. We appreciate every token of consideration and intention healing vibes and want to offer our sincerest thanks. 


As is Elise's very nature, others before self is a constant mantra which has guided her through this life. Despite an intimidating diagnosis, her first thoughts were to continue helping others and her dreams of creating a scholarship as well as continuing her work with her magazine The Jamwich. A magazine dedicated to the uplifting of the grassroots music and arts community. We would like to accelerate the timeline for her goals and to do so requires financial assistance that we are seeking through crowd funding. Ultimately, her cancer treatment and travel requirements of 3 hours drive time will create a financial strain as well as the more typical costs of months long medical treatment. From our original post with the announcement of the cancer diagnosis:

""An open letter to our family, friends and community.What I have to say at this moment is incredibly difficult. Some of you already know, but most of you do not. This past October has been one of the most trying and unfortunately, the next twelve months are going to make it look like an easy month.After Resonance Elise found a lump in her right breast. She had a gyno appointment coming up at the start of October. Her gyno then set up a mammogram which led to a sonogram which led to a biopsy. We received the results for the biopsy on Tuesday and consulted with a surgeon and oncologist yesterday afternoon. She has been diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer. This is a highly aggressive and abnormal breast cancer that refers to any breast cancer that does not express the genes for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2/neu. This means that there is no targeted treatment for this type of cancer but there are still numerous treatment options. They took a blood sample so they can test for the BRCA1 gene. Determination of this will result in a clearer picture of which treatments we move forward with.The other night I asked her to make a list of goals of which she would like to see achieved in the following 12 months. In true Elise fashion, those goals had nothing to do with her and everything to do with others. The first goal is to fully establish our non profit scholarship fund JAMMA. I will be establishing a go fund me in order to fast track this process as well as to raise funding for hiring additional staff and resources so that we can keep the magazine, The Jamwich up and running while she is undergoing treatment. There will likely be numerous financial hurdles moving forward, and that’s my responsibility as her husband. However it will be difficult to handle the massive increase in duties and finances.Life changes in an instant. All the plans we make mean nothing when fate steps in. I’ve said it before and I’ll continue to say it, do more take less, love is an action word so get busy. You never know when your time will end and how much will be taken from you at any given moment. Hug your loved ones, assess your priorities, be vigilant and always do the right thing, you may not get a second chance.With love in our hearts and hope in our thoughts, we will continue to move forward in trying to lift up the community. We will be attending a few shows prior to treatment. Try to come out and spend some time with us before we get started down this trying road.11.3 Lettuce Feat.

Everyone she comes across loves her, and with reason. Lissett and Scarlett’s story32 years old, pregnant, with cancer. What was thought to be what they call a benign ""pregnancy tumor” turned out to be osteosarcoma of the mouth. After undergoing a 14-hour-long surgery while 26 weeks pregnant, surgeons were able to remove the bottom right half of her jaw where the tumor was located and reconstructed a new one. Three days later, she was back in the OR because of a clot. After weeks of being hospitalized, she was finally discharged but recovery was short lived because she had to return back to be readmitted when she noticed her vision from her right eye became blurry only to find out that her tumor was back and compressing her optic nerve.On August 24th, In order for Lissett to undergo her first round of chemo ASAP, Scarlett Lissett Cuarezma was born prematurely at 30 weeks at Jackson Memorial Hospital weighing 2 lbs 15 ounces. She is currently thriving and on her way to being discharged around early November. On August 28th, Lissett was discharged home. She was readmitted days later because of neutropenic fever caused by infection. Once the fever was gone, she underwent her first round of radiation and underwent a new chemo treatment which lasted 3.5 days. Currently, she is still admitted while recovering from the debilitating side effects of treatment. With her newborn baby girl, husband, family, and support team as her strength, Lissett is fighting and remaining positive as she goes through this difficult time. There is still an unknown journey that lies ahead.  Once Scarlett is out of the NICU in 6 weeks, her husband, Julio, will be taking a 3 month FMLA leave from work. This will allow Julio to take care of Scarlett while Lissett’s mom continues to care for her during radiation and inpatient chemo.

My mom is a wonderful mother to me and my 13 year old brother Caleb, and an awesome ""Momo"" to her six grandbabies--spoiling them as much as she can. But, in April of this year my mom (Shannon Sutton) was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer that has spread to her bones.  This was a devestating diagnosis as she had been in pain for a few months dealing with, what we thought, was pain from a car accident when someone rear ended her.  She has remained positive throughout this journey even though she is in constant pain, frequently her pain goes unmanaged.   After radiation treatment and several rounds of chemo, she is currently in chemo management, where she goes and receives chemotherapy every 3 weeks indefinitely.  This drug, while prolonging her life, takes an awful toll on her body.  It is hard for her to attend work every day, and my dad also has been taking off of work to help take care of her.  I come to you all asking for help! I am very helpless in this process but one thing I can do is reach out to you in their time of need.  I am trying to raise some funds that will help purchase a lift recliner for my mom.  She is unable to sleep in a bed due to her pain, and spends a lot of her time in a recliner.  There are some days where the random muscle and joint pain makes it hard for her to get out of the chair herself.  The remaining funds will be given to my parents to help cover some of their co-pays for the countless doctors appointments and to slightly help with the loss of income. Anyone who knows my mom, knows she loves to help people in any way that she can, whether its through service, monetary donations, or offering prayers. So, I am asking if any of you could help pay it forward on her account.  I understand it's a hard time of year for everyone, and any funds will be greatly appreciated.  If you can't help monetarily (and even if you can), please please please pray for her healing and comfort, as that is worth more than any amount of money that can be given.  Thank you so much for loving my mom and family! Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions.Allie Walker",db763741c6442d03cadc6b0a8e88263e,20,0.918,780.0,4,1,0,0,1,0,1,0.0,0.002331002331002331,0.26735333631885355,0.0,1.0,0,1,0,0,Journey,gofundme

I am starting this GoFundMe campaign to help my beloved Ana, who is currently going through a very tough moment in her life.  While she was in the 26th week of pregnancy, doctors detected she had a metastatic  uterine cancer which has spread to her lungs. She went through an emergency c-section, giving birth to our premature baby girl. The baby is now stable, but doctors are still doing tests to verify the baby did not receive any cancerous cells via the placenta.  Ana is currently receiving urgent treatment and hopefully it will stop the cancer spreading to other areas. Ana’s family live overseas and I would like to bring them over so they can spend some time with her in this difficult situation. Their love and support will help Ana cope emotionally with this nightmare that our lives have so suddenly turned into.Bringing her parents, brother and sister will generate travel expenses and other costs which we'll struggle to cover on our own.Not only is there the cost of bringing over Ana's family, but also the financial uncertainty brought by the lack of our family's primary income that would cover mortgage, car loan and the extra unforeseen hospital expenses such as, extra days in daycare for our 2 year old boy, transport, car parking and fuel, and take-away food while I'm in hospital.For that reason, we are calling out for help. Even the smallest donation can help us face this moment with a more solid footing. We cannot express how grateful we would be if you could donate to this cause with whatever is within your capability. Donating or sharing this GoFundMe campaign through your social media network will mean a lot to us (and will give Ana a better chance).Thanks in advance for your support and kindness,Michael Wachholz.________________________________Hola amigos, familia y conocidos. Estamos comenzando este GoFundMe para ayudar a mi amada esposa Ana, quien en estos momentos está atravesando unos momentos muy difíciles. Ella se encontraba en la semana 26 de su embarazo cuando le detectaron cancer de utero con propagación (metastasis) en los pulmones. Lamentablemente la propagacion de los pulmones avanzaba rapidamente, poniendo en riesgo la vida de Ana y nuestra hija. Asi que no hubo otra opcion que hacer una cesaria de emergencia, trayendo al mundo a una bebita prematuramente. Afortunadamente nuestra bebé se encuentra estable, pero los doctores siguen haciendo estudios para determinar si la pequeña está libre de cáncer.La familia de Ana no vive en Australia y yo quisiera que vinieran para que compartieran tiempo con ella en estos momentos tan dificiles. Su apoyo y amor ayudaran a Ana emocionalmente a agarrar fuerzas para enfrentar esta pesadilla en que se ha convertido nuestras vidas en tan solo una semana.Traer a sus padres, hermano y hermana acarrea gastos de viaje, alojamiento, comida, etc. que obviamente no estamos preparados para cubrir.No solo los gastos de traer a la familia de Ana, sino tambien la incertidumbre de no tener parte del ingreso familiar para cubrir compromisos financieraos como el prestamo de la casa, el carro y otros gastos medicos o extras en el futuro como dias extras en la guarderia para nuestro hijo de 2 annos, estacionamiento, transporte, comida afuera cuando me quedo en el hospital, etc.Por esta razones, necesitamos ayuda para seguir adelante y ganarle la batalla al cancer. Hasta el apoyo más pequeno hace la diferencia en este momento de tanta confusión. Les agradecezco con todo mi corazón que nos ayuden donando con lo que esté dentro de sus posibilidades. Por favor, compartan a través de sus redes sociales esta campaña para tener mayor difusión y Ana y nuestra hija puedan recibir mayor ayuda.Muchisimas gracias por su buen corazón y apoyo,Michael Wachholz",01b8278eaff7eac4fe53d1a20eca92b4,21,0.72845,360.0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

For those of you that don’t know Tim, his confidence is contagious as well as his laughter.  He is hard working and a jack of many trades.  His favorite place in the world is on the ocean because it is so humbling.  His greatest strength is his will.  When he puts his mind to something, it will be done.  He is confident he will beat this through the grace of God and with your support we can help him win the FIGHT.",43556ea1207a9dae759b2f52be5b5237,20,0.495,600.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

On July 9th, 2014, Sarah was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct cancer.  Over the course of the next six months, Sarah courageously endured the surgery and chemotherapy her doctors prescribed.  By the following summer, Sarah seemed to have won her battle. However, on February 8th, 2016, a check-up revealed that the cancer had returned and spread to both the lungs and liver.  Since that time, Sarah has suffered through repeated rounds of chemotherapy, radiation, and multiple surgeries. Despite these efforts, the cancer remained and Sarah continued to fight.  Over the course of the past five years, the Bennetts have waged a costly battle against cancer.  Because of her treatments and the cancer itself, Sarah has frequently been unable to work, often for long periods of time.  Because of the rarity of her type of cancer, Sarah has had to seek out specialists, participate in clinical trials, and oftentimes travel great distances.  Most recently, she had been making weekly trips to Boston and back, adding travel, food and lodging costs to what are already burdensome medical bills.

Over the past few months we had seen some changes in him, he had lost his appetite, was losing weight, was a little moody, would cry randomly, was very clingy to his mama and eventually seemed to be in some sort of pain. Julie, for over a month, knew something was very wrong with our once happy, carefree little boy.  She kept taking him to doctors appointment after doctors appointment, where the doctors would tell her that while they felt some hard knots in his tummy, that they thought it was poo and that he just needed some miralax.  Finally, in the early morning hours of July 26th Carson woke up vomiting profusely.  Julie and Tim (Carson's daddy) ran him to the emergency room at Randall's Children's Hospital and that day their world came crashing down.  Carson was diagnosed with cancer.  He had a large mass in his tummy.  It took days for more information to come.  Carson had to endure ultrasounds, blood draws, urine cultures, MRIs, CT Scans, a tumor biopsy, a bone marrow biopsy, a nuclear scan, blood transfusions, etc. etc.  On Friday the 28th it was confirmed, Carson had Stage IV, High Risk Neuroblastoma.  The cancer was in his bone marrow, his bones had lesions from head to toe and the mass in his tummy wrapped from one side of his back to the other.  The mass also wrapped itself around the main vein in his tummy, so that made it immediately inoperable. The doctors have told us Carson will go through the most intense, aggressive treatment plan there is.  He will have 6 rounds of chemo, stem cell transplants, radiation, immune therapy, and much more.  On Monday the 31st Carson had his double Hickman port installed and started his first round of chemo.  It's made him very nauseous, but other than that he's been in good spirits.  His blood pressure is skyrocketing, his heartbeat is through the roof and his oxygen levels are very low.  He's not stable at this point, but the doctors are working diligently to help him and so are his parents.  Tim has taken leave from work through FMLA, but since they are a one income household you can imagine the financial impact this is having on them.  We have created this gofundme to help cover any expenses they have during this time.  It's going to be approx 2 years of treatment for Carson.  We know it will be extremely expensive, so any and every donation is greatly appreciated.  We also have a donation account set up at US Bank for those of you who would prefer that. Please pray for Carson, keep him in your prayers, he needs all the love, support and well wishes that you can provide!

A 9-year-old boy from Israel was just diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, had a tumor removed from his brain, requires a life-saving treatment which is not available in Israel, has to travel with his family to New Jersey to receive the treatment his parents can’t afford. We need your donations. Every dollar counts. Here are the details (This is my son, Jesse, in the video. He's well and healthy, and needs your help saving his friend's life): 

Moran Zukarel is our friend. She lives in Israel with her husband Mor and their three children Idan (9), Or (5), and Bar (2). Moran is an attorney, happily married, who until recently lead an ordinary life just like you and me. Two weeks ago when Idan, her 9-year-old son, started throwing up and complaining about headaches. Their pediatrician ran some tests, all came back normal, leading to the conclusion that it’s probably just a virus and time would heal it. Moran felt there was more to it and insisted on getting an MRI. The results turned their lives upside down in one second.A large tumor was found in 9-year-old Idan’s brain. He immediately went into surgery lasting several hours. All family and friends prayed for good news. We all wanted to hear the doctors say the tumor was benign and that Idan can just go back to playing soccer and going to school like every other kid. Unfortunately, the tumor was diagnosed as stage 4 cancer.The family quickly learned that the life saving treatment Idan requires in not available in Israel, and they will have to travel the United Stated to receive the therapy.

As I am writing these words, the family is making arrangements to travel to New Jersey, where Idan will be treated. The cost of the treatment, travel, and accommodation is out of their reach. They are spending all they have, but they need help.  Friends and family are helping as much as possible but that’s not enough. They need our help to fund the treatment.

And let me tell you, through this whole process, she has stayed srtong and positive. I admire her. I don't know if I could ever even pretend to be as strong as she is.

In late February 2017, Lois was diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon Cancer, after she started experiencing what we first thought was appendicitis. A CT scan revealed a large (3 inch) mass where the small intestine joins the large intestine (and right next to the appendix). Subsequent scans have confirmed that there are additional tumors lining the abdominal cavity, but gratefully, not affecting any of the other major organs (liver, kidneys, lungs are clean).Lois is now undergoing her first chemotherapy treatment. Our oncologist anticipates a 4 month chemo program, with treatment every other week to shrink the cancer as much as possible. After that, major surgery (HIPAC) to clear out the abdominal cavity (removing the colon, appendix, and other linings), recovery, and then another 2 months of a different chemo. In all, we are anticipating between 8 to 10 months for this to take place. There is strong belief from the oncology team that a cure is possible, and is what we're aimed at. With guidance from her team, we also hope to augment this with holistic and naturopath approaches to help boost her immune system as it will be weakened by the chemo.As an independent, self-employed photography team, we will not be able to work, or only do so at a minimum as we direct our energy and efforts toward Lois' healing. We are asking for support during this difficult time of transition to cover our basic life necessities and restore Lois' health. When possible, we hope to take on commercial assignments (product shots, architectural, branding, etc.) as time and energy allow.As her husband and life-love, my immediate and ongoing focus is to provide as much of a positive and healing environment as I possibly can, so that Lois can focus on what it takes to beat this. Lois is extremely strong, upbeat and indomitable, and believes that we will overcome this.

Our sweet, caring, selfless mom was diagnosed towards the end of 2016 with a rare form of Sarcoma Cancer that was caused by the radiation treatments she received about 28+ years ago for Colon Cancer. It was very hard to hear from her Oncologist that this form of Sarcoma Cancer she has is not curable. She is and continues to be a strong woman and a survivor for all these years! She has been trying to stay optimistic and positive about this Cancer fight! 


She has already finished two rounds of radiation over the past couple of months and there have been some improvements on the lesions she already had but her recent PETscan revealed the Cancer has spread. She will start a round of chemotherapy this week. We are hoping it helps lesson her pain and the spread of more lesions.


Some of our family and friends that know what she has been going through recently have been asking how they can help during this difficult time in the fight for her life. Just a simple prayer could make miracles happen! But at this point we are asking for more than prayers. The medical expenses are starting to pile up so we are asking for your help. The money would go towards co-pays, medication, gas and other daily expenses to keep her comfortable. It would be great to eliminate the financial burden from our parents to focus on what really matters at this time. If you can help we would greatly appreciate it! 


If you personally know our mom, you know she is a very special woman that loves people and being social! Our family always jokes with her by saying she knows everybody in town and... she does! She has such a kind heart that wants to help out everyone she knows but she now needs your help. 



We want to thank everyone for the continued love, support and prayers during this difficult time. We will try to keep everyone updated. Please feel free to share this go fund me post with your family and friends. Continue praying!

Brea's mom already has missed 2 weeks of work due to this last surgery and now the doctor has scheduled another surgery for the first week of January.  We know the next surgery will be another week or so in the hospital and then we are expecting chemo but we don't know for how long.  It's likely Brea will be able to go home after the surgery and then have to return multiple times each week for the chemo.   Brea lives over an hour from the hospital so that will be a lot of gas money that will be needed.   


I am raising money for Brea's mom as she will not be able to work again until chemo is over.  Brea's mom also has another daughter who is 18 months old.  Our family is doing what we can to help Brea's little family but we need help.  Her vehicle needs a new transmission so a family member is loaning her a car. 


The $4700 will help with rent, utilities, diapers, and gas.  The funds are needed now to cover the next few months until Brea's mom can return to work.   


This means so much to me because I have seen the struggles Brea's mom has gone through growing up -- and I have seen her pull herself up by the bootstraps.  She has turned into a wonderful young lady and a great mom.  Brea's mom is overwhelmed by all of this which is why I'm starting this campaign for her.  I could not imagine being in her shoes right now.  Any and all help is greatly appreciated.  Even if you are unable to help financially, I would love if you would add Brea and her family to your prayer list.",8d45223527b59549f2a75603f8311714,19,0.7755319148936171,750.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Due to the corrupt and inept privatized health care system in Colombia, he been denied care here, even though he is paying monthly for the insurance plan. The nephrosopy bags and tubes are the same ones surgically inserted the US and although one is leaking we have been unable to find them here. Daniel had to literally tape up the bag to prevent it from leaking everywhere (the hospital sent Daniel off to look for one all over the city).Daniel is literally fighting for his life. It is common in Colombia for people to apply for a Tutela, which is essentially an application for a court order obliging the insuror to provide the payee with care, medication or whatever may be in issue or being withheld. We got an Urgent Provisional Order from the court that Coomeva, the medical health care insuror, set Daniel up with a Urologist Oncologist and get him the radiography tests needed immediately. Yesterday, the company refused to comply with the order sighting only procedural delays and the absurd excuse that the company is ""going through a difficult time right now"". We are now left with nothing except to wait for the Judge's Sentence and Order on the non-provisional Tutela. The struggle continues to try to access care here and we have thus set up a GoFundMe account to raise money to pay out of pocket for the oncologist, MRIs, contrast xrays and chemiotherapy. Please help in any way you can by sharing with as many as you can and with any small donation.

Fuck you!!!!!  We were hopeful that we got it all and stopped it​in its tracks…we did not.   My follow up scans in late April (protocol dictates 3 months from the time of your last radiation/chemo) found the cancer had spread to my lungs.  Oh at first we thought, we hoped (oh how hope springs eternal) it was an infection and we ran tests and tests an tests. I was poked and prodded and stitched up and after two procedures to biopsy the nodules in my lungs the final results came mid June.  Yep! It's Cancer.  Fuck you!!!!!  ​After some conversations with my oncologist, the wonderful Dr. Mita,  that sounded an awfully lot like Charlie Brown talking to any adult (whaa, whaa, whaa) we settled on a new treatment ASAP.  Guys it was hard to hear that I had to start a new battle and I had yet to heal from the last--I'm just starting to chew and God bless TASTE food.  I was on the precipice of healing and these fucking tentacles wrap round me and snatch me back.  But I digress, Dr. Mita and I spoke about my treatment options.  I decided to go with a new clinical trial BPT.  It started Thursday, June 21st.   My treatment is on Thursdays--two weeks on then one week off and so on and so on.  The treatment consists of two chemo meds and is all IV meds and since my first fight my veins are for shit I had a port implanted in my right bicep so they don't have to try to find a good vein.  I come in and they just access that port and they can draw blood (so much lab work) and give me the meds no problem.  Each session is about 8-6 hours so I sit with my girl (Jess, my love) and/or friends and family.  I love having the company to chat, laugh, cry and eat (june brings the best snacks).   Look folks I’m coming to this forum to ask for help in this battle because I cannot do this alone.Trying to get a family portrait:  I should just pull my teeth out.",f575b44fbab8cef9d9060c63ad077853,37,0.31083333333333335,180.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Upon further analysis, her cancer was re-diagnosed as  Ewing's Sarcoma. This is a very rare cancer that grows in bones and soft tissues around bones, such as cartilage or the nerves. It trypically occurs in children and young adults, and is highly uncommon for adults. Julia's sarcoma was located on her chest wall, and because of its location, it was originally diagnosed as breast cancer. Because of the new diagnosis, Julia will have to continue chemotherapy. The new medication administered during her chemo may affect her fine motor skills and may cause numbness to her hands. She's usually very exhausted after chemo treatments and requires help with her children. Julia and Chris were traveling to Manhattan for each round of chemo (chemo is now administered closer to Julia's home). Parking and their hotel cost about $1,000 each trip when they have to come down to NYC.

This type of breast cancer is extremely rare and agressive, and it accounts for fewer than 1% of all breast cancers. Treatment for this cancer is tricky as it can have metastasis (when the cancer has spread beyond the breast).Julia is a wife and a mother to three children. Her diagnosis is a shock to us all.Julia will be starting three rounds of chemo soon. Her tumor is very large (around 5-6cm), and it is attached to the chest wall. She will be reassessed after her first round of chemo to see if her tumor is shrinking. If chemo is unsucessful, she will have surgery. Post surgery, she will need radiation every day for six weeks. Her treatment will most likely continue until June 2017.Julia and her family live in Poughkeepsie, NY. Because she is being treated by experts at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York, NY, her travel expenses are upwards of $50 per day.

We’ve met with our Oncologist and she recommends radiation and a host of hormone blocking medication that she will most likely be taking for the rest of her life. Although her diagnosis was grim we remained faithful and continued to pray through this. Yesterday we toured the Cancer Center for Healing in Irvine and met with Dr. VonSchaefer MD who is a surgeon and has been practicing medicine for over 30 years. She has been trained traditionally and also integrates cutting edge treatment with her patients. Besides the hyperbaric chambers, infrared saunas, blood cycling, natural IV treatments, and all the other awesome natural treatments they offered, they offered my wife HOPE. We sat in the car after the appointment and she said, “this is the first time since the appointment with the Oncologist that I feel I have hope that I’m not going to die.” POSITIVITY is the mantra now and I’m reaching  out to my FB fam for help. Inquiring about loans but it takes time and her pain is going on NOW, this cancerous tumor is growing NOW. We do not want radiation or chemo therapy so we are taking this natural route for healing. They are recommending 4-6 weeks of treatment, 5 days a week, for 4-6 hours a day. These weekly IV treatments will tally about $6,000 and that’s not including the other herbal supplements she has to take, not to mention treatments after the IV’s to aggressively attack these tumors and prevent them from returning. We obviously do not have this type of money laying around so while we search for ways to liquidate our own assets I thought I’d try this to get her treatment started faster. This experience has spawned an idea to start a non-profit for women like my wife who are seeking other options to radiation. So many people need access to treatment and information like this place has to offer.  Thanks for reading. God’s got a plan and he will not give us more than we can handle.

His treatment plan is for chemotherapy for 3 months, surgery, recovering for 3 months and 3 more months of chemotherapy. The costs of treatment, insurance coverage and co-pays are not fully known.The Parks/Lewis family is well liked and loved. Many friends and acquaintances have asked how they can help. Donating funds will help the family with some medical costs and living expenses in Seattle while paying their bills in Homer. The funds may be used to help his parents fly back and forth to Homer for seasonal work. There is also a link on Hoxie’s Face Book page for donating mileage tickets.  You can also send messages to Hoxie and family on this site. Thanks so much for any donation, positive thoughts and prayers for his recovery. Gratefully, Marcia Honea and Carl Aronson",4fc5d5f7178eaf90fe287fb408964512,17,0.4573684210526316,660.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Officially as of September 20, 2017 when Amanda and I finally took the time to have our Dream Wedding. A month later some minor pains began with Amanda. For the next five months they would increase to the point of us finally seeking medical attention. She has had painful ovarian cysts in the past and we chalked it up to that. Until January. Her pain was so unpredictable it became impossible for her to run our homebased business and raise our three toddlers by herself. So we made the choice for me to leave my job, come home and take care of her and the kids while we pursue our home business dream. 

The Dream turned Nightmare in February as she was diagnosed with Cervical Cancer. At age 27. To follow that date, Febuary 26, 2018, would be nothing short of hell on Earth. 

March came, and a radical hysterectomy would ensue. With the surgery, my wife was to be rid of cancer and also her ability to give birth. A very difficult decision, but made seeing that we have three beautiful healthy children already. Surgery complete. However, Amanda is upgraded to Stage 2B after another tumor had to be removed deeper in her cervical wall, caught the surgeon by surprise. Suprise to us as well. We new radiation would be needed as preventative maintenance, but now what?

End of May comes, treatment begins. Amanda undergoes both Chemotherapy and Radiation because there are remaining cancer cells. Its no longer preventative, its vital for her survival. 

Now here is July. Treatment is done. She is a month away from finding out if she is remission or needs more radiation. Its a joyous time. However for 6 months, we have been forced to push off bills a various amount of ways. We have channeled as many options as we can find, but its simply not enough. 

I, Shawn, am asking for $5000 to help pull us back to normalcy and at least floating with our debt, not drowning. We are working tirelessly at our homebased business to continue to dig out, however its not enough. And if I return to work, our home business will suffer so it makes no sense to leave my wife and children at home to make the same amount of money. 

I am beyond humbled by this terrifying experience and ask that to all who can help, please do. We are the first ones to donate and help those in need and honestly it sucks to ask for this. I have no other options. Thank you for reading our story. 

Love,
The Buskirks

Kueth! Peter is starting his cancer treatments right now,  so your money will be used to pay doctor's bills and living and travelling expenses and help us survive. We don't want to let any stone unturned to save Peter's life.My name is Eva Kueth , Peter's wife of 36 years and I try with all my heart to successfully run Peter W's campaign to stay alive and to experience his options. We tied the knot to stay together in good and bad times. I am desperate and don't want to lose him. When I went to my work in a rehab/nursing home in recent weeks I wished I could take more care of Peter.  He really needs me.  And it is my duty number one to take care of my husband. whom I love dearly.After Peter's fight against  kidney cancer in 2010,   a total nephrectomy of the right kidney and the surrounding tissue we were naive enough to believe that he had conquered the beast. It never even crossed our minds that the beast was only sleeping and ready to attack again. Since May 2016 our life has been shattered. We knew that something was terribly wrong because Peter became weaker and weaker and lost 100 pounds or more. Since then the blood work has been devastating, the CT scan and the Pet scan and then lastly the biopsy confirmed that the beast came back with a vengeance, now named ""advanced renal cell cancer stage IV"".Since his diagnosis Peter had two admissions to the emergency room, has been diagnosed with a-fib, had two blood transfusions, and a mediport installed, his aneuyrism (Triple A) of 8x8 cms repaired to be ready to even be able to receive cancer treatment.We will have an appointment with Dr. Guru SonPadve at UAB for a second opinion!There is always a light on the end of the tunnel. And I hope the tunnel will open up to come to the light. Receive wisdom and guidance from God. God knows that we want to keep Peter for many more years. Both his parents became very old. That means that genetics are good. I pray that the results will be manageable. We, tte Kueth family, are waiting for a miracle.Please keep us in your thoughts and prayers and donate for this good cause. We are not able to make it without you!Thank you so much my dear friends.",dda118fe949e8099853f0ff72a0c9cc6,21,0.5632,930.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

A decir verdad, en el momento se me nublaron los pensamientos el día que me lo dijo el cirujano. Pero junto a mi esposo y mis 3 hijos, decidimos enfrentar este proceso juntos. ¿Que si emocionalmente se afectaron? pues sí. Pero lo que les ayudó a ellos y a toda persona que me rodea, fue mi sonrisa y mi actitud. En vez de yo ser fortalecida, yo daba fortaleza a aquel que se preocupaba. Comencé con las quimio en junio, si, esa, la que le dicen el barbero, pues a la siguiente semana de la primera, el cabello comenzó a caerse y me fui a recortar corto mi cabello, pero al segundo tratamiento tuve que raparme completamente. Para mi sorpresa, ese fue el comienzo de muchos cambios. Comencé a ver la vida de otro modo, a valorar las cosas más de lo que pensaba. Comencé a vivir el momento y el día a día. La trayectoria ha sido un camino fácil de recorrer, ya que mi actitud siempre ha sido positiva. He tenido un grupo de apoyo de gente hermosa, la cual dentro de todo me han ayudado económicamente para el proceso, al menos para mis tratamiento y citas medicas durante los meses de junio a octubre. La mastectomía fue realizada para el mes de noviembre. Durante ese tiempo, mis cuidadores fueron mi amado esposo y mi madre. Como leerán, mi esposo estuvo presente durante todo ese tiempo; en mis días de citas, en mi cirujía y luego cuidando de mi. Que en todo ese tiempo, no pudo trabajar, pues alguien tenía que hacerse cargo de nuestros hijos, y de mí como enfermero, ausentándose por un mes y medio. Aunque nos acompañó mi madre, pues el buscar y llevar a los chicos se encargaba él. En mi hogar el único sueldo fijo es el de él.

While they were there, they had a bump looked at from a fall she had earlier in the year. The doctors took an initial scan and discovered it was a tumor, the size of a baseball. A biopsy was performed the next morning.After a week of tests, Makayla was diagnosed with high-risk, Stage IV Neuroblastoma. It’s devastating news that no parents want to hear, especially in their 16-month-old daughter. It came as a shock since Makayla has never shown any signs of discomfort or pain; she's been a happy child playing, laughing and growing.Unfortunately, additional tumors were found in her cheek, kidney, spinal cord, and it has spread to 80% of her bone marrow. Due to the size of the tumor which started near her kidney, she had a nephrostomy put in to drain the urine since it was pressing up against her kidney.  A port has been inserted into her chest as well so that she can receive her chemotherapy treatments. Makayla has already received her first round of chemo and the doctors are hoping chemotherapy will shrink the tumors so that no major surgery is needed. After two weeks at the hospital, Makayla was finally able to go home and see her big brother Jayden. Both Diana and Jonathan are taking periods of unpaid leave for the foreseeable future to take care of their family. Makayla will have to undergo at least 18 months of chemo and spend more overnights at the hospital.

We have already spent 22 lakhs (44k$) on his treatment, Which was near to impossible for us. We have to take loans from banks and relatives. Monthly expense on his medicines and chemotherapies comes around 1 lakh rupees (2000$). Now the doctors are recommending immunotherapy for which we need atleast 8-10 lacs rupees i.e 20k CADs. I know there’s cheap treatments available in government hospitals. There’s a lot of waiting for just getting a bed in these hospitals, even we have applied to government schemes for help. When we finally got registered at a government hospital, doctor wasn’t able to give any relief and surgery didn’t went well. Now they’re refusing to take the case again. And we don’t have much time to decide and delay the treatment because cancer is at stage four. I am the only one who works to support household and everything. I need to pay for my brother’s school fees and loan Emi’s at the same time. I am losing control on everything. As a student, I cannot do much. I work more than I am legally allowed.

  Dean hopes to attend (wearing a mask of course and with doctor approval).    Prayers for Dean that this is possible because he is really looking forward to a change in scenery and that Chemo can restart soon with good results.   Thank you everyone for your ongoing support.  He sees all your words of encouragement, so keep'm coming!   Dean truly is amazing.  He is NOT giving in and does his best to remain positive throughout these setbacks.  Dana1/3/2019 Update:  Yesterday Dean did round 2 of Chemo here in Sacramento.  Because the bilirubin count was still a bit high, his doctor opted for another 80% treatment.  He came home yesterday attached to a small mobile pump that will be removed on Friday.    As for the origin of the cancer itself.....still waiting.   Meanwhile, pray that the tumors in the liver respond and start to shrink and that the side affects associated with treatment are at a minimum.   To all of you, thank you for your ongoing support and love for my brother!   Dana  12/26/18 Update:  Dean finished 1st chemo round on Friday,  12/21/18, in San Francisco and came back home with Cindy to Sacramento the next day.  So, the battle begins.  He is looked well considering!   We had our typical Christmas Eve family and friends celebration at our house (Kelly's)  with lots of singing, presents, and food (and the Raiders won)!  It was wonderful to have Dean there (he wore a mask!).   We are still waiting on additional test/biopsy results to pinpoint the type of cancer.   More to come.  I hope you all had a blessed Christmas!  Dana12/19/18 Update:   Dean's surgeon at UCSF installed a stent in the biliary duct yesterday evening during the endoscopy procedure.     There is a possibility that Dean does not have pancreatic cancer, but rather biliary duct cancer.   With the stent, hopefully the bilirubin can drain.   He had a rough night.  Cindy is providing us with regular updates.  Thank you Cindy!   Chemo starts today in San Francisco.  Thank you for all the prayers!12/18/18 Update:  There's been a set back.  Dean is now at UCSF undergoing additional tests.  He went there Sunday late with Cindy and Lily.  Because his bilirubin shot up, chemo cannot start until the cause of the blockage is determined and addressed.  Dean is mighty yellow due to jaundice.    He had a CT scan last night, awaiting the radiology report, and later today he will undergo another endoscopy (possibly ERCP).     He has the best doctors circling the wagons.    Dean continues with his sense of humor like only Dean can!    Thank you to all!  Dana Kelly12/13/18 Update:  Dean just now got out of surgery to have the port placed in order to begin chemo.   The doctor was very pleased with how this big procedure went!  On Monday he has an oncology consult at  UCSF with Dr. Ko who is a colleague of Dean's Oncologist, Dr. Javeed,  here in Sacramento.  We should find out soon when the actual treatments will begin and of course, continue providing updates as we learn more.  Again, we thank all of you for your ongoing support through GFM and for the many prayers, words of encouragement, and picture posts!  Dean sees and reads all of them!  Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.   Dana Kelly 916-847-6864.    12/6/18 Update:  Hi Everyone, Dean was officially diagnosed this morning with pancreatic cancer.   He will start chemo immediately.  Bill and I (Dana) want you all to know how overwhelmed he is with the support that has been pouring in from family and friends across the world, and from people who don't even know him!  You are all amazing with your ongoing love and encouragement and gifts that will remove such a huge financial stressor for Dean as he fights this.  I have shared with many that my brother never asks for anything....he only gives.  We thank all of you.  God bless you.  Keep the faith and prayers flowing.  Dean has just been diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic cancer.  We love him and want to do all we can to help.  If you would like to support him,  please donate.  It's easy!Updates will be posted as we learn more.",83e39e3120b318a81be5ae32fd8db8eb,69,0.6174,30.0,5,1,0,2,0,2,0,0.0021413276231263384,0.0,0.4353009036723707,4.319300840421983,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

We want to do everything we possibly can to turn that into 10 years. Help Narda get the treatment she needs to extend her life and raise her daughters.HistoryNarda grew up in South Africa. She lost her mom to cancer when she was seven years old. Seventeen years later she married the love of her life in his parents living room in Canada. They have two beautiful daughters that are seven (Olivia) and nine (Annabella). In 2011 Narda was diagnosed with breast cancer and learned that she carried the BRCA2 gene that she subsequently learned runs in her family. She underwent chemotherapy and thought she had beaten the disease. Then in 2017 a routine CAT scan after a ski accident revealed a tumor on her liver. Tests revealed it was the same cancer as before, now in metastatic form. There is no known cure and 50% of patients do not survive two years. Narda wants to live 10 years so she can raise her daughters to young adulthood with Brian, as she knows too well the cost of not having a mother during teen years.  TreatmentTo fight this horrible disease Narda needs to explore and undergo treatments not currently available in Canada that will enhance the effectiveness of the chemotherapy she is receiving. Cancer drugs and treatments often have decades-long trial periods before becoming available for widespread use and Narda simply cannot wait.  There is a regional treatment available in Germany that has had tremendous effects for people in Narda’s situation. Pursuing this treatment would cost $147,000 in medical bills alone. They are still deciding what to do, consulting with their Canadian oncologist, but this route looks promising as a way to dramatically increase Narda’s life expectancy. Making a DifferenceNarda wants to make sure that her fight will impact and inspire others.  The reality is if Narda had known she was a carrier of the BRCA gene she could have had surgery that would have reduced her chances of having cancer from more than 85% to less than 3%. It would have saved her life. Narda’s husband Brian is a professional filmmaker, and together they will document Narda’s story and crusade to ensure all women are tested for the BCRA genes so they can take action to prevent cancer. We need to raise this money NOW so Narda can begin to get the treatment she needs. Please help us raise the money to make sure Brian and Narda can raise their beautiful daughters, Olivia and Annabella, together.",57971ada69478f834e1c39b400c8697c,23,0.762665,480.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Sore throat, coughing, etc. Went in to see the Dr and was told I had strep throat and bronchitis. Took antibiotics and seemed to get a bit better, but still had a scratchy voice and dull throat pain. I waited for it to get better, but it just never seemed to. In February I went to a different Dr and she had me get a CT scan. I went to Sac and saw an ENT and was informed that there was a tumor. A biopsy confirmed throat Cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma p16 Negative of the larynx, to be exact. I decided to go home and be home with my loved ones while I undergo chemo, radiation, or possible surgery. After seeing a Dr in Az at the Banner Cancer center, we decided that as of now radiation will be the best option. It will involve 6 weeks of radiation and require me to be out of work for around 3 months between treatments and recovery. As of now the Dr seems confident he can save my life, but unsure of whether he'll be able to save my voice box or not. The tumor is right in between my vocal cords. So far my breathing isn't restricted and I can eat, but aspiration and pneumonia are a concern. I go in for a swallow study the first week of April. If it requires surgery, that entire section of my throat will be surgically removed. I will have to do therapies, need a feeding tube to eat, and I'll have to learn how to talk again and may never be able to fully regain my voice. We're hoping that isn't going to be necessary, but scared.During this time I will not be able to work and I am scared that we will not be able to keep a roof over our heads, let alone pay for my medical bills. With Melody already staying home to care for Daisy, and now me, I just don't know how we'll make it. We are downsizing and I'm letting go of my truck, and temporary disability will help but we still are going to be barely keeping our heads above water. I'm embarrassed and hate this, but I'm letting go of my pride and asking for help if you are able to.

Steve has cancer.As is usually the case, Steve didn’t always have cancer. He has always been a healthy guy. Healthy, overwhelmingly positive, kind. In all the years I’ve known Steve I would be more than hard pressed to come up with one person he had ever been anything but nice to. Steve is one of those people that makes you wish you were better at being a person. Steve is better at everything he does than I am at any one thing I do. When his time as a drummer for international touring bands came to an end he just up and decided to learn photography and videography.  He mastered the arts and became a highly sought after artisan. He can make the most important day of one person’s life look like the most important day in history. Steve is authentic; he is the genuine article. Steve is the brother I never had.Steve had spent a little time in the hospital recently because he was having stomach issues, which turned out to be an ulcer.  When he told be me he had spent a few nights in the hospital I raised my voice and became cross with him for not telling me. He is my best friend. I could help.November 6. He texted me the day he found out the particularly problematic ulcer wasn’t healing correctly. It wasn’t healing because the ulcer had cancer in it. He was going to have surgery to remove part of his middle stomach.  This is very common, just not in someone Steve’s age. 33. Scary problem, easy fix. This would be the first of many times that we would hear the phrase “extremely uncommon in someone your age.”November 9. Surgery day. Procedure was to start at 1pm. I wished him the best, hoped for even better and waited to hear everything went well.  At 6pm I got a text, “Surgery took longer than expected… they ended up taking out his entire stomach.” What? Is that even a thing? Can someone live without a stomach? What could they have possibly found that would make them think it was a good idea to remove his entire stomach? It wasn’t until the next day that we found out the answer: cancer. Lots of cancer. We cried. They removed his entire stomach and twenty-seven lymph nodes and sent it all off to a lab. The doctors told him they sent it off to see if they “got it all.” My immediate response was how can they see if they “got it ALL” by looking at what is out of his body already? Probably not the most helpful.November 16.  A week after surgery and we were anxiously (nervously) waiting to hear back about the results. Results came back: Not good.  He has aggressive, invasive stage 3 gastric adenocarcinoma.  His entire stomach was engulfed in it. Thirteen of the lymph nodes had it. When receiving the news, ever-optimistic Steve was taking it all with the positivity only Steve could. The doctor said to Steve “I don’t think you understand how serious this is.” Whoa. Ouch. Okay. So we’re doomed?That escalated quickly.It was just an ulcer. Then the ulcer had cancer. Then it was stomach cancer. Then it was cancer also in his lymph nodes. Then it was stage 3 gastric adenocarcinoma: extremely uncommon in someone his age. All in a matter of a 10 days.December 21. Steve started chemotherapy.In the past two months I’ve learned a lot about cancer. I’ve learned that cancer is not honest. I’ve learned that it can mutate to look like normal cells, to hide amongst healthy ones. I’ve learned that cancer can live in a person’s blood undetected.  I’ve learned that some people lack a gene that all-but-prevents them from going into remission. I’ve learned that Steve is one of those people. I’ve learned that fighting cancer without the benefit of a fully functioning digestive system is an additional challenge. Most importantly I’ve learned that cancer can’t subside my best friend’s spirit.Steve is my best friend. He has a long path to recovery ahead of him. So many people have reached out with their kind thoughts, prayers, love and words of encouragement. Overwhelming amounts of people have asked if there is anything they can do to help.  I wanted to start this fundraiser to give that opportunity.  Steve has the monumental task of healing ahead of him. I am hopeful that through this fundraiser we can raise enough money to take that burden off him so he can focus all of his good vibes and energy towards his body.Please, if you feel inclined, donate to this fundraiser to help with the ever-growing medical costs that come with the treatment of the miscreant that is cancer. If you are not so inclined, we also accept positive thoughts, prayers, vibes and meditations.Whatever that looks like, help us help Steve beat cancer.",54fb6ded82b157a0c83df08d5a0434cb,65,0.961925,390.0,5,1,0,2,1,2,1,0.002328288707799767,0.0011641443538998836,0.7764042507048362,3.176418581286331,3.759241488831995,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

He was getting his resume and applications out into the world and after a short family vacation, was ready to embark upon the profession he'd worked long and hard to prepare for. Three weeks ago, while heading out on a family celebratory vacation, Mason felt a severe pain in his abdomen and the diagnosis has been a devastating blow. Mason has been diagnosed with a very, very, rare form of cancer, Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT). Sarcoma cancers account for about 1% of all cancers. This specific sarcoma was first documented in 1989, and so far approximately 200 cases have been described in medical literature. Mason is an amazing person, a dedicated fiance, an honorable son, a great brother, a smart and contributing member of his university community, and of course a budding young professional. His education tells him this is a great challenge, but his passion for life and everyone he has touched along the way, will be his strength and support in beating this cancer. Ironically, while at Embry-Riddle, Mason was a volunteer for cancer fund raising. For his abundance of giving, passion for life, incredible friendliness and respect for others, (not to mention his incredibly enviable head of hair) Mason is earned the love and respect of many in return. On Friday June 02, 2017,   Mason Saldana, MS, GSP was the honored recipient of the Arizona Chapter of American Society of Safety Engineers Inaugural Student of the Year Award. This award is in recognition of his continual hard work, leadership and dedication to the chapter throughout the past year. Unfortunately, he was hospitalized in California and not able to attend the ceremony and receive this award in person. As always he was there in spirit. This is Mason, giving it his all to everything in life.  The amount of this Gofundme has been carefully budgeted. There is no excess. This amount is to help him stay near UCLA for the next year. The next 6 months are going to give him a run for his money and that's what we are doing here. Making sure he is in the race. Please feel free to contact us for any financial justification.  We are all in this to help this incredible young man live a long, loving life, in service of others.

For the most part, that's been fine! I've been lucky enough that in that time I'd never come down with anything worse than the occasional cold.Even still, I was really proud of myself for doing the correct, adult thing and getting my own health insurance last year, and apparently in the nick of time: after a few confusing, stressful months -- which I laid out in much greater detail over here -- I was diagnosed with cancer & more or less immediately taken into surgery, where they removed a few feet of my small intestine & a section of my liver.I didn't lie when I first saw the doctors -- why would you? -- and let them know that I'd had some incidences of stomachaches before, but none so serious that I'd been compelled to see a doctor about it until this past summer.And all throughout this time, there were no signs that anything was financially amiss -- I was still asked to pay out-of-pocket for a few doctor visits, but was told that it was because health insurance companies can sometimes wait until the very end of the year to process larger claims (like major surgeries), so that it wouldn't immediately eat through your deductible.It wasn't until early this year that I dug further and realized what was actually happening: Humana had decided at the end of the year to deny all of my claims and left me with a hundred-thousand dollars worth of bills. I immediately started working with the Patient Advocate Network through Livestrong and was assured this was probably a routine, almost clerical, error. Because I'd had no history of medical problems prior to this, the insurance company was obligated to check back through years of history and sniff around for (in my case, non-existant) clinical records to see if I'd gone in for anything related before.It wasn't until a few weeks ago when the formal denial letter came through that the gravity of the situation really hit home: because I hadn't lied when I saw my first doctor -- because I'd told them that I'd had stomachaches at any point in the past five years, whether or not I'd gone to a doctor for it -- I'd fallen under a fine-print pre-existing condition clause that said that any signs of illness that could possibly have led a doctor to a diagnosis since 2008 were cause for denying any compensation for any ailment of pretty much my entire alimentary canal.Patient Advocate took a look at the letter and were super candid: the chances for a successful appeal were basically zero.When I tell people this, their first reaction is always: I don't get it, didn't this just get fixed with the new Health Insurance Marketplace? And it did, and it's maybe the single most important part of the initiative, but it only covers anything from January 2014 on, and I had the misfortune of being self-employed & sick in America in 2013.It's always been extremely hard for me to ask for help from anyone, but outside coming under the patronage of an eccentric billionaire (still working on this, no luck so far), I don't have much recourse left to climb out from under this, and so I started this campaign to help tell my story and ask for some assistance.The silver lining is that I'm still alive & I'm back on my feet & my health is stable for now -- I get regular monthly treatment meant to slow my decline, and my first post-surgery scan came back with essentially good news -- and also that the support I've had throughout all of this has been incredible.That support may include friends & colleagues also coming together outside this campaign to help get me through this, and any additional assistance outside my immediate needs will be put into the cost of that on-going treatment -- as you might expect, from now on, it costs me many, many thousands of dollars more per year just to stay alive. And, you know, this is just the first time I've been dashed against the rocks on my way out to sea. There will come a time, hopefully not too soon, when things will get more serious again, and knowing I've got a bedrock of support is the most important thing in carrying through those tough times, so my thanks to everyone that has, will or can help in any way.",ff052aeb1ed172c8a3a9d05d7dfec46e,9,1.9740272727272727,1770.0,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Holly was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer on Nov 7, 2006.  Holly had a lump removed and lymph nodes, followed by chemo and radiation. The treatments ended July 5, 2007. In April 2008 Scott had a seizure and was diagnosed with brain cancer. On May 8th, 2008 Scott had brain surgery to remove what they could. In June 2008 they went through a flood and lost everything in their basement. Friends and family raised a lot of money through a benefit they held that helped our family in so many ways. Both Scott and Holly continued their check ups throughout the years. In 2010 Holly had a mammogram that showed spots too close to the chest wall to biopsy, so after much thought Holly choose to have a double mastectomy Holly also went through a hysterectomy in 2012. In December 2015 Holly went to the ER for high blood pressure and was admitted to the hospital with high calcium levels and acute kidney failure. Holly was assigned a kidney specialist who did all the tests he could to figure out what was causing the high calcium levels and the kidney injury. The Dr. found out that the chemo Holly had caused the kidney damage and continued to do tests to figure high calcium levels out. On April 1st, 2016 Scott had his yearly check up and found out his brain cancer was back, wider and deeper. On April 13th,2016 Holly found out that the kidney specialist had done all the tests he could and now passed it to Holly's cancer Dr. So as they were trying to set up appointments for Scott's brain cancer, on April 20,2016 Holly had a pet scan done and on April 22, 2016 Holly is diagnosed with recurrence of breast cancer that is Stage 3 and more aggressive than the previous one.  On May 5th, 2016 Scott had brain surgery to remove the cancer and then started chemo and radiation on June 9th an 10th. Scott will continue on chemo for 15 months. Holly had surgery on April 28th, 2016 to remove the cancer and started chemo on May 31, 2016. Holly will continue to  have chemo every 3 weeks through Sept. 13th, 2016. She will have around a month off and then start 4-6wks of radiation followed by hormone therapy. Unfortunately with Holly's continued health problems w/ high calcium and high creatinine levels and the 3 different chemo's she receives, she spends a lot of time at the cancer center and in the hospital getting iv's for numerous levels being off and ending up needing and getting two blood transfusions. As anyone who has gone through things like this knows how hard it can be to ask for help financially...both Scott and Holly have been off of work since this started in April 2016 and still have a long road ahead of them.

His parents were understandably very much against it, so he ran away from home. At the young age he left the comforts and security of his home and went to the Himalayas in his quest for God realization. There he lived at the banks of the Ganges with enlightened yogis. There he was taught Raja-Kriya Yoga. Under their supervision he practiced what was taught to him for seven years. Yogivah Giri Ji is now a Kriya Yoga Master at the enlightened state of Siddha-bhakti Samadhi. This is the final enlightened state of Bhakti Yoga where the heart of the devotee is completely pure, removed from all vasanas, and he is continuously in the state of God consciousness.He earned his living through paintings but now he spends all of his time teaching and guiding people between India and USA, and in spreading Kriya Yoga of Mahavatar Babaji's tradition (which is also propagated by Paramahansa Yogananda all over world). His pure, sincere love, and compassion has won many hearts. Many people from all around the world are now his devout followers. It is said that Saints and birds are the same. Birds never store food in her nest to eat in future. Same way Saints and Sages never accumulate material objects, they live in the present moment. But somehow their needs are always met through the cosmic forces that govern the Universe. The sincere seekers stay with their Guru, constantly supporting and providing for all their necessities. Yogivah Giri Ji is my divine friend, a God-sent Guru, and a spiritual guide. Yogivah Giri Ji can be contacted on facebook at  https://www.facebook.com/yogi.vah/. One may request to be added to his facebook groups where he writes, guides and inspires people on spirituality and Kriya Yoga.The purpose of this fund is to help my dear friend Yogivah Giri Ji to fight his battle against cancer. Yogivah Giri Ji was diagnosed with bladder cancer in June of 2015. On July 9, 2015 he underwent surgery to remove the tumor from his bladder. This was possible through the help of his devoted followers who collected funds for the surgery. Thankfully the surgery was successful. He has now been advised by his doctors to go through BCG treatment to prevent the cancer from recurring. This is a painful treatment, and also financially draining, creating mounting medical bills. The BCG procedure is a long term ongoing treatment. Initially once a week for six weeks, then later once a month for a year, to be continued in reducing frequency for following ten years. The post-operative treatment is expensive and long term. He can't afford to pay the enormous medical bills. I am trying to gather funds for his continued treatment and we need your support.Yogivah Giri Ji's enlightening and uplifting teaching has helped many souls. He says, “If my life is spent in loving and serving people, I will keep on doing till my last breath. My sickness would never be the deterrent”. Though in severe pain and under torturous treatment process, his spirit is still high. He is regularly helping and solving problems of all who approach him even in his most difficult time. My humble request is to kindly support him with this treatment, with whatever amount you are able to donate. Your generous support is very much needed at this time.

The only treatment doctors here recommend is chemotherapy to attempt to shrink or slow down the tumors. Our world has been turned upside down every second since that moment. Carol is my wife and mother of our four wonderful children. She has been beating the odds ever since I met her. We started dating very young and had our first child while she was a freshman at Loyola University Chicago. She went on to graduate and has been teaching in Chicago Public Schools for 13 years. The child of Mexican immigrant parents, she is the first in her family to get a college degree. She is loved by all of her family, friends, coworkers, students and students' parents. She can make anyone feel special because she knows how to care and love unconditionally. Right now, she is in a lot of pain. It has been continuous and progressive since August of this year. She has grown weaker and has taken a leave of absence from work.This newest challenge in our life has reaffirmed our faith in God. It reminded us why we named our first child, ‘Faith’, 18 years ago. We have been praying and asking for a sign or a miracle. We’ve talked about the miracles we have already witnessed. There’s an old Mexican tradition that I watched my dad practice in San Juan de los Lagos, when I was a child. He made a promise to God that we would return every year, if God would make my eyesight better. He would get on his knees and pray the rosary from the entrance of the church and crawl all the way to the altar. It worked; my eyesight improved dramatically as I grew up. Last week, we visited the Shrine of our Lady of Guadalupe in Des Plaines, IL. I got on my knees and prayed the rosary, with all my faith, as I crawled towards the shrine. The next day, my sister happened to show me a photo of a stone with our dad’s name on it that our family recently had dedicated to him. I had no clue that his stone was placed in the ground at the shrine in Des Plaines. I realized that I had crawled right over my dad’s name the night before, performing the same ritual he taught me 35 years ago for someone I love as much as he loved me. It was a sign. The same day, Carol’s cousin texted her the link to Hope 4 Cancer. It is the only place that we’ve found able to CURE the same diagnosis Carol has; another sign. This is the path God has put before us.We are asking for $40,000 to cover expenses for travel, stay and treatment at Hope 4 Cancer Institute (hope4cancer.com ), where Dr. Antonio Jimenez has helped cure many diseases with his groundbreaking approaches and procedures. Since it is in México, our insurance does not cover it. We have researched many clinics around the world, and this seems like the most comprehensive, non-toxic solution for getting our Carol back to good health. We know that chemotherapy only has a 2.7% success rate, and we understand how the US medical field may be compromised by big pharmaceutical corporations, keeping patients on drugs without any interest to truly cure an illness. Please, consider helping us reach our goal as soon as possible. I would like to raise the money by Friday, November 18, 2016. Every second is ticking and every penny will help. Carol is only 37 years old. We have many more happy memories to make with our family and friends for years to come.

It began with a small bump and eventually grew tremendously -- and fast. So much that it had affected his normal eating habits, sleeping habits, and pained him to talk.  After several visits to the doctor and surgery to have it removed, samples of the mass were sent to a lab for further inspection. We were not expecting the results that followed.My Uncle, father of 2 children (Pablo [14] and Ruben [24]), a husband, and a second father to me and my siblings was diagnosed with Stage IV Lymphoma Cancer. As an all-too-common story for many, it was the worst nightmare imaginable and the course of our family's lives was instantly changed. Dario has kept a positive attitude -- he seems to be the most postive out of all of us -- and chose to relentlessly fight back. He was advised to meet with an oncologist and in the following weeks will begin receiving extensive chemotherapy and radiation. My Uncle has an immense support system filled with friends and family constantly offering their help, and that has no monetary value. He has all intentions of beating this, will accept any form of treatment advised to him, but ultimately cancer can quickly drive you to emotional and physical bankruptcy. As a floor installer, his means of making a living requires a physical toll. Because of the aggressive treatment he will be receiving and the pain, he will not be able to work. His job does not have any company benefits, paid time off, or disability meaning that he will be receiving no wages. My Aunt Maria, his wife of 26 years and counting, makes a living off of house maintenance. His oldest son, my cousin Ruben, has a part-time job with the company Apple and is currently working towards an MS in Bioinformatics. While both have already made adjustments and have taken up more shifts, help is still needed -- and a lot of it -- from people like you. And while we are optimistic about his treatment and care (and God-willing, a cure), his greatest concern is the ability to provide for his family while battling this aggressive, and unbelievably costly, cancer. As many know, there is no time to waste with such an aggressive form of cancer. Nobody likes to ask for help, and it isn't easy to admit that this is a reality, but it's really what we need. We are asking for donations of any kind that will allow him to continue fighting hard. Any and every dollar we receive will go towards paying medical bills, treatments that won't be covered by insurance,  any other unexpected expenses that are to come, and even basic needs like groceries and house bills.

Knowing I am here asking for help is hard but the truth is we can’t do this alone and need your help again. I want to get rid of ""Terrence"" the Tumour for good so we can get on with life, perhaps start a family of our own and make plans for the future for us as a couple but for hopefully our children too. My surgeon wants me to start chemo & radiation right away and then get into local trials. With brain cancer chemo and radiation isn’t a permanent solution it’s a short term solution. What I am after is a long term treatment, something that is going to give me more than the year I am promised, something that is going to give me hope and quality of life, not something that is just buying a bit of time but resulting in the tumour growing back anyway. We have been looking into treatments in Mexico and Germany offering immunotherapy that is having incredible results, which boost your own immune system to fight the cancer itself, hopefully buy me more time and one day this tumour will be stable and my body show no evidence of active cancer so we can move on with life as well as possible.The downside to this is the huge cost that it involves and this is just a rough estimate without travel costs or currency conversions that will most likely exceed predictions, as even after the initial intense regime to get the tumour stable, patients generally continue to go back for years to come.  German doctors have told me they have patients with brain cancer and my specific tumour still living 8 years after this treatment, this is so promising and I am so excited by this possibility. We are in direct contact with people with brain cancer who are now stable after this type of treatment and doing incredibly well with multiple stable scans. The main treatment being the Dendrictic cell vaccine, where they take some of my blood and culture a vaccine specific to me which boosts my own Immune system to eliminate/stabilise the remaining tumour. This vaccine is administered 4 times initially spread out 4-6 weeks apart,  so the travel to and from the clinic, the loss of complete income, the bills we have to still pay at home whilst doing this is what we are up against and unfortunately we can’t do it on our own. I will continue to be completely transparent and share everything I implement along the way, as well as with such a grim prognosis which I am not settling for we will be doing all we can to tick things of our bucket list and continue to live our life to the fullest while I can.Seeing and experiencing new things as we can afford to do so, as I visualise myself living a long and healed life but I can’t ignore the statistics of this beast and need to act now so we can fulfil our life dreams and grow old together. Thankyou from the bottom of our hearts for all your love and support as my journey continues 3.5 years on and I still believe I can and will beat this! As always, I got this Love Sammy & AJ xx",997bb09e12317c9f196343fc197be958,19,0.491125,90.0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

 aggressive blood cancer that affects the bone marrow and immune system. Little did we know that this diagnosis would upend our lives and toss us into a roller coaster of treatments, health scares, health triumphs, and in general the unknown.He began chemotherapy treatments shortly after his diagnosis, landing him in the hospital for a whopping 9 weeks. He was afflicted with kidney stones, gout and a tooth infection on top of his cancer. He was released from the hospital the first time after receiving chemo and treatment for those ailments, but was admitted not long after for an emergency gall bladder removal surgery.  A few months later he landed in the ICU for pneumonia and almost died. He received a few more rounds of chemo and started naturopathic remedies including vitamin C infusions and hyperbaric treatments- all out of pocket costs.  His cancer started to trend down but in May of 2018 the cancer returned so he flew down to Hope4Cancer in Mexico to receive targeted treatments.  The doctors could not get ahead of the growth of cancer cells so they cut his stay short, sending him home to the states for an emergency round of chemo (Hope4Cancer does not use high-dose chemotherapy treatments).  His oncology team paired his chemo with a new drug called Mylotarg which is used to target the parent cancer cells. He was in the hospital for 45 days! In September of 2018 we received the news that he was in a technical full remission! During this time, he was advised through his team at SCCA to do a consolidation round of chemo and get a bone marrow transplant. Our dad was adamant about using the transplant as a last resort.  He was fortunate to be accepted into a clinical study that would drastically reduce the chance of a full transplant. He had the consolidation round of chemo at the end of October 2018.  He went in for blood draws on November 19th where 25 vials of blood were drawn to use for testing in preparation of this clinical study.  He then had complications from the last round of drugs and blood draws and spent his Thanksgiving in the hospital. On November 26, 2018, we got the devastating news that his cancer returned with a vengeance to 22% blast cells.Only 2 months had gone by cancer free. That goes to show you just how aggressive this disease truly is.While all of his health complications were raging on, there was more going on behind the scenes outside of his hospital visits and outpatient treatments.  Our parents both lost their jobs.  Our parents lost the entirety of their savings/nest egg.  Our parents were forced to sell their home because medical bills outweighed cost of living. He had to spend his birthday, holidays, and special occasions laying in a hospital bed.  He almost died three times. Our mom became his full time caregiver and spent countless hours shuttling him to appointments, making 911 calls and executive decisions regarding his treatments.  She was appointed as his power of attorney.  Can you imagine how exhausting this is?  We gave up our jobs, friends and independent lives in Colorado to come home to be with our family in their time of need.  Cancer affects the entire family. That brings us to the present (reminder: he is at 22% leukemic cells at this point).  The bone marrow transplant is his last option to get the cancer under control.  The chemo has not stuck.  The clinical trial he was approved for stipulated that he has to be in remission for six months after a relapse so that is no longer an option.  His insurance will only cover a portion of the procedure.  We are asking for donations to cover the transplant and the cost of living.  SCCA provides some housing but the space is limited so our parents may be living out of a hotel (he cannot be more than 15 minutes away from the SCCA campus due to high risk of complications). This experience has been more than traumatic for our family.  We are pleading for donations to get our dad to the finish line with this transplant so he has a fighting chance to beat this disease once and for all.  Remember, you could be one diagnosis away from an experience similar to ours.  Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for taking the time to read this, share our story, and donate.  Please use the hashtag #bonemarrowdinero when sharing to spread awareness about our story.  Let's make this viral! With love,Anja & McKenna<3",04c0bcf32f567c5794a5079e10d2bcad,45,0.1566,30.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

This has never been so true as recent events have led our family down the hardest path we have ever endured. On March 22, 2018, our son Blaze Powell, fell “being a boy” at recess and this simple injury turned into a life changing (life-saving) event.  Blaze was taken to Children’s Hospital/UAB with concerning symptoms from the fall. Within hours, our world was turned upside down after preliminary tests came back showing a mass within his prostate. After additional weeks of testing, labs, surgeries, and scans, the doctors’ suspicions were confirmed that Blaze has  Undifferentiated Sarcoma within his prostate. This rare diagnosis requires additional testing, scans and labs as they are still uncertain of the type of cancer that is growing in his tiny body. They have decided to begin a general chemotherapy routine that consists of 2 different types being administered within 3-4 day stay at Children’s Hospital every 4 weeks. During the second round of chemo, Blaze will also begin to undergo Radiation, with hopes that after 13 weeks, the doctors can go in and remove the tumor, so long as it has not grown. In addition to the hospital treatments, Blaze will undergo injections and medications at home to help with his battle against cancer.  We know this battle will be long and it will be difficult. It will challenge us in ways we have never even imagined. But one thing is certain, we know that God is in control and He will lead Blaze down a path of healing, not only for his body but within his heart and soul!

CANCER. Throat cancer. Receiving that diagnosis is hard to swallow (no pun intended). It’s not I who received this diagnosis; I had my date with cervical cancer in 2014. This time, it’s the love-of-my-life, my better half. Jason—my awesome, affectionate, handsome, doting punk-rocker-Navy-SEAL-badass-father-partner-in-crime---has the Big C.

It all started a couple of months ago when Jason noticed a lump in the side of his neck.  I immediately suggested he schedule a doctor’s appointment, but it wasn’t until 3 weeks ago that he picked up the phone to make the call. He was seen the next day, and scheduled an appointment for a biopsy, chest X-ray, and PET, which all occurred within a week of that initial appointment. When he went in the following week for the results (the biopsy of the lump was inconclusive, the chest X-ray was clear, and the PET revealed a few other questionable spots around the lump, but nothing else anywhere in his body), they scheduled an operation to remove the lump that same week. Three days later, the lump was removed along with several lymph nodes, which, when biopsied, had carcinoma. Then, his tonsils were removed and biopsies from the base of his tongue were taken to test for the source of the cancer. The good news would have been that the cancer was in his tonsils, thus he was now cancer free because of the tonsillectomy, but we weren’t so lucky.

We thought we had already been dealt a healthy serving of misfortune from life from which we are still trying to recover, between cancer affecting me & his mom, his constant search for employment, my grief over my relationship with my brother, the loss of our home/forced downsizing to a tiny, over-priced box, which, consequently, pulled what Aiden considered home right out from under his feet, the bills...If it weren't for our incredible bond and desire to persevere, we would be an absolute wreck.

Given Jason’s newly diagnosed cancer and upcoming treatment, the already-existing struggle to keep a roof over our heads and all bills paid is about to get even more real. After months of searching for employment, Jason started a new job less than 2 weeks ago, but was only able to work 2 shifts before getting hit with the operation that led to this cancer diagnosis. (Jason’s new employer can’t---and won’t--- continue to employ him if he’s unable to work the hours for which he was hired to fulfill.) How's that for timing?

So, how do we make ends meet, living in this outrageously-expensive area on only one income, and monthly bills totaling $4,770 (not including food/groceries, household necessities, gasoline, or laundry costs)? Unfortunately, my efforts to make some extra cash off of occasional sales of a bunch of antique and vintage family heirlooms and my original art just isn't consistent. 

So...we get by with a little help from our friends. At least, that’s what we are hopeful for during this shit-storm of misfortune. It’s hard to smell the roses when we can barely breathe as it is, so some wind in our sails that will help Jason and I battle his cancer is all we can hope for.

In an effort to bring in additional income, I have created a ""Fuck cancer"" series of original mini-canvas magnets, which I am selling for $10, so please comment or email me at glampunkglass@gmail.com if you'd like one.

 Your love, generosity, & support (in any capacity) is beyond appreciated.",cdc71db5b9e8c9c67e41824c2564ecce,26,0.6871666666666667,150.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Like most Florida kids he has had his fair share of sunny beach days that turned in to sunburnt nights. 16 months ago one of those sunburns caused a small (pre-existing) mole on his right shoulder to bleed. In less than one year that one small mole has now become Stage 4 Metastatic Melanoma Brain and Lung Cancer.In 2015 Jake's small mole was removed, along with a golf ball sized amount of infected tissue, and it was diagnosed as Stage 2C Melanoma. After the removal of the skin cancer and the skin graph to cover the incision, Jake quickly healed and follow up scans showed the cancer had been isolated. But on March 14, 2016 the nightmare of that one small mole resurfaced in the worst way possible. Jake was told his Melanoma was back and it had now spread to both of his lungs and his brain. Less than one day after being told he now has Stage 4 cancer, Jake underwent surgery to remove a 2cm tumor from the right frontal lobe of his brain. The surgery was a success but radiation is required to assure that no cancer cells remain, and it will not be until after his doctors feel that his brain cancer has been controlled that they will even begin to treat the cancer in his lungs.This will be a long and hard fight for Jacob. We are asking from those that know him, please donate what you can to help make this difficult time easier for the sweet, happy-go-lucky big kid we all love. Medical bills not covered by insurance, other healthcare associated costs as well as general living expenses will all need to be covered for our friend. And for those that have not had the pleasure of meeting Jake, we ask that you find it in your heart to donate what you can as well. Jake's life is just beginning. The carefree days of his youth have quickly ended and he is now facing a fight that most of us will hopefully never know. Please donate to help ease some of the stress from his battle. Whether you know and love him, or know someone who loves him, or if you can simply relate to the sunny beach day loving kid that Jake represents, please share this campaign and help do what you can to not only help Jake in his fight but to also raise awareness to the severity of the lesser known dangers that skin cancer can cause.",a017025ef144615cd318d5015ca28364,16,0.56965,1020.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

As humbling as it is, I am asking for your help.  My hope is that your donation will help to alleviate some of our financial stress and allow Lori to relax and focus on her treatment and healing. Any amount that you can comfortably give will be so greatly appreciated and EVERY dollar counts.  Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart.  Sincerely,Jason Michel",90cc7d07dede31b91ea53bbae20ecd9b,13,0.5558,180.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

She is a single mother who is so kind, optimistic and diligent in all aspects of her life. She always knows how to make the best of any situation, and is not afraid to work hard to get things done....and yet this illness has emotionally, physically, and financially devastated her.TL;DR: We need money, as soon as possible, to help cover medical costs, and other bills that have accumulated since she has not been able to work, or get aid money.She wasn't expecting the first time she got diagnosed with Breast Cancer back in 2005. I was too young to really, do much of anything, much less help out in any meaningful way. And my mom, like always, took it upon herself to handle mostly everything on her own. We managed to scrape by with the emotional support from me, our family, and her sheer willpower. Oh and our dog, Harry Potter.In May 2018, our dog Harry, who we had for 15 1/2 years, and who helped mom a lot emotionally through the first cancer battle, passed away. Two weeks later, she got the diagnosis that her Breast Cancer had come back.She couldn't do radiotherapy again, in the same area so she had to get a total mastectomy, and chemotherapy. The impact of everything on my 60 year old mother, was too much. It breaks my heart to see someone so strong and cheerful....crumble down and cry.For 6 months, it's been nothing but hardship. Her surgery was in June, the mastectomy and reconstruction all in one, 6 hours of surgery. It left her unable to go home for 2 and a half weeks because she needed extended recovery time. She could barely walk. And when she got home then it was a continuing battle with the places she worked at, trying to convince them that she really was sick and that she needed money. Not only was a lot of the process delayed or rejected for no reason, but in this constant blocking, her jobs caused her to be denied any other disability help she really needed. No one seemed to want to help, or thought that she was just trying to take advantage of the system or something. She deserves better than this.She's still recovering from her surgery. She only just finished all her chemotherapy in November. She lost all her hair that she loved, and has been too weak or in too much pain to do much of anything at all, even stuck in the house. It was a huge physical and emotional toll on her. Not to mention all the financial burden that accumulated during the times she was sick. She feels guilty for getting sick, as if she can help it. All this suffering, while she was just fighting to live.From May to December of 2018, it's been just a nightmare of stress and suffering. I've been doing my best but I'm only one person, even with family helping too, there's only so much we can all do. It's frustrating and at this point I'm ranting, but I'm tired of the constant struggle just to get any kind of help.I'm tired of seeing my mother cry.

Schnitzler, daughter of our beloved Rochester Gymnastic s Academy JO Men’s Coach Gary Schnitzler, was born in Rochester, NY twenty seven years ago.  Throughout the years she has brought joy to many with her beautiful operatic voice. She studied vocal music at Nazareth College and received her bachelor’s degree in 2011.  She started auditioning at several colleges around the country to further her studies at graduate school.  She was honored with acceptance to Peabody Institute at John Hopkins, Chicago College of the Performing Arts at Roosevelt University, and Rider University. This was to be her most difficult cross road until she was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after.

In January 2016 she was seen in an Urgent Care for a lump she found under her arm. She was told not to worry as she was healthy and no concerning family history. In April during auditions for grad school, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. In May of 2016 she underwent a double mastectomy followed by hormone therapy, soon after she had reconstruction surgery. In November 2016 she noticed a “rash on her incision”. Biopsy revealed more cancer. Subsequent testing, (CT scan and bone scan) revealed spots on her lungs. She now requires aggressive chemo therapy treatment for stage 4 breast cancer that metastasized to her lungs.  This has been an astounding and shocking diagnosis for a 27 year old woman to experience in her most adventurous, productive, and tender years. Not only has this been emotionally draining for Amy and her family, it has caused immense financial strain.


Rochester Gymnastics Academy staff, family, and friends have joined together to bring forward this Go Fund Me site to offer our assistance to offset some of the financial burdens, such as treatments, medicines, travel, and any other unknown or unexpected costs.  It is tough enough to endure this emotional journey, much less keep up with the financial demands.  It is our hope that we can offer financial relief to an already taxed woman and her family.


Amy and her family thank you for your warm thoughts, prayers, and giving in this time of need.

Endless appointments to her primary care physician and a gastroenterologist never found the root cause or a solution to her problems. She was treated over and over for gastritis and ulcers. My mom never got ""better"" with any of these medicines. Her problem got worse as months went by.  Foods just didn't sit well in her stomach, and the symptoms strengthened. My mother got FED UP and demanded ANSWERS and for some kind of TESTING to be done! Finally, they listened. However, this was not the answer we ever imagined. Our lives changed forever: Sept. 20, 2017 -- Marina was diagnosed with Stage 4 Cancer of the Stomach. After a biopsy on Oct. 4, 2017 it was official cancer was inside her.Visits to three different oncologists ended with similar results; they all said that she would have to undergo harsh chemotherapy for the rest of her life and that surgery was no longer an option. Despite the news, Marina is here to fight this horrible disease.After researching her type of cancer and the effects of chemotherapy, we discovered some alarming information. Stomach Cancer is pretty rare in the U.S and not much research or funding goes towards it. Symptoms arise when it is far too late, and you're already in the 4th Stage.  We learned chemotherapy is extremely harmful (even to other areas of the body), making other organs susceptible to cancer in the future or possibly lead to organ failure. As a family, we have decided to take a more natural, holistic approach to this tragedy. Please keep in mind that with even chemotherapy or radiation, this form of cancer only has a 4% survival rate. We want to defeat these odds as well as provide quality of life for our mother.After researching countless hours for answers, testimonies and various facilities, we found an alternative medicine / integrative oncology clinic in the U.S -- Mesa, Arizona. The facility incorporates radical changes in diet, natural alternatives and metabolic protocols that do not harm the body, including: low dose chemo therapy, curcumin infusions,  and many other methods in order to reverse the disease. These procedures along with the stay in Arizona result in a total of $45,000.00. These treatments are not covered by insurance, due to her insurance being state funded in New York.For more information on the clinic visit:  www.anoasisofhealing.com

We have FAITH, that she will beat this and get to LIVE to see the other side.  She dreams of a house and a beautiful garden of her own. She has so much to live for, at age 45. She is a compassionate, hardworking. Marina is a strong wife, mother, daughter, sister, friend, and grandmother.

Your funds will directly help with costs for Marina's treatments, and alleviate the financial burden of Marina being unable to work. You will help her assist with ongoing medical costs and living expenses that have yet to come. Please consider donating whatever you can as well as sharing our story.Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart.

The amazing surgical team at Montefiore were able to remove the entirety of that tumor (about a 6-hour surgery) and 2 weeks later he was set to have TWO bone marrow transplants back to back. Before Jaidan’s transplants he went in for a minor surgery to place a PICC line in his right arm for more access to his heart for the high dose chemo he would require for his transplants. He ended up having that surgery re-done twice while in transplant due to the lines getting clogged. The second and third time this was done at bedside without sedation. In November Jaidan began his first transplant. During this transplant he basically had every side effect expected (oxygen problems, low blood pressures, mucositis all down his GI tract (mouth, chest, stomach and anus) fevers, pain and severe burns from THIOTEPA a high dose chemo) He also had any where from 8-15 Ng tubes placed (down his nostril into his gut) for nutrition before they decided to put him on TPN (IV feeds) . Jaidan was sent home for Halloween week and then expected right back in December for yet another transplant. But after all the ups and downs on December 14, 2017 Jaidan was declared cancer free but would need to continue treatments through August 2018 to increase the chances of his cancer not returning.The end of January Jaidan was to get admitted for CH 12.14 (antibody therapy also known as Immunotherapy) this is a 10 hour infusion 4 days a week that requires admission and causes excruciating pain the whole 10 hours it runs. Here is where the complications began. Jaidan was then diagnosed with aHUS (atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome) another rare, life threatening genetic disease that can damage to major organs like kidneys, heart and brain. But in his case was not genetic but was more associated with the toxic medication he had received to rid his cancer. Jaidan did have permanent kidney damage due to this. His body began to break down his platelets and red blood cells and he was receiving transfusions twice a week and was unable to be released from the hospital. In this phase of his treatment I was supposed to return back to work. Instead I was trying to find a doctor that had enough knowledge to treat this rare condition that had only been seen in 3 other patients so far out from transplant. Jaidans doctors didn’t know how to treat him anymore and wanted me to allow his body to recover on its own. I would not accept that as I did my research and knew how important it was for this condition to be treated asap before he would need dialysis or even further a kidney transplant.I stopped all medication and decided to transfer him to Memorial Sloan. While in the process of transferring Jaidan to Memorial Sloan Kettering (who were readily willing to treat his condition and get him back on track with his cancer treatment) Jaidan’s body miraculously took a turn for the better. He stopped breaking down his blood and platelets, he was no longer releasing protein, schistocytes and glucose in his urine and was only getting transfused once a week. To date Jaidan hasn’t needed a transfusion in over 2 weeks. I was declined by insurance twice to get Jaidan into sloan. He was now cancer free and his preventative care was considered “not medically necessary” even though the chance of relapsed neuroblastoma is well over 50% and the treatment was imperative for Jaidans overall survival. After making a few phone calls and agreeing to take financial responsibility for his medical needs due to his insurance being out-of- network, he was accepted into sloan and signed up for a trial phase treatment that is only offered by sloan Hu3f8. At this point I have no idea what we will be responsible to pay but I am aware that the cost of treatment is well over $100,000.00. We moved from the Bronx to a cleaner environment for our sons health and increased our commute by 30 minutes. I am now driving back and forth to the city atleast 3 times a week, paying for my own parking in the city and also food for our 3-4 hour visits a day. Jaidan is being admitted for a full week for all his cycles due to the very dangerous complications he has suffered thus far. The most recent being 3 viruses at once. He suffered from parainfluenza, human metapnemoniavirus and C-diff. We are fundraising for the expenses we can no longer afford and whatever we will be responsible for Jaidan to continue treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering. Should any complication arise during treatment additional funds will be needed. If funds are raised that exceed the amount needed, the hope is that this fund can provide to other childhood cancer patients and their families for years to come in honor of Jaidan Carter, a true fighter and inspiration to so many!",4756aaed829b6422be671a03fb412086,33,0.06755,570.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

She has a wonderful caring wife and a twelve-year-old son who is the “light” of her life. They need your help facing life’s most horrific battle – Glioblastoma brain cancer.Kris is the funniest person I know and makes everyone feel like they matter. She is my lifelong best friend, and I am not the only person who feels this way about her. Like many of her closest friends, I met her working at a music store. She worked in the music business for many years at Sound Warehouse, Record Bar, and Randy’s M&M’s. To say Kris is an avid music and movies fan understates her passion for artists who connect all of us. She loves all kinds of music from Sheryl Crow, Trisha Yearwood, Olivia Newton John to Shelby Lynne, Alison Moorer, Elizabeth Cooke, The Bangles, Amy Grant, Big Star, R&B, and classic country. She and her son love to listen to music together on the way to school and share time watching the kids show Gravity Falls. She loves Turner Classics and all Hitchcock movies. She is known to quote Grease, Clue, Bob’s Burgers, and Laverne and Shirley. Before her surgery she quoted Planet of the Apes “You cut up his brain!” Even facing brain surgery, she made us all laugh.On December 10, 2018, Kris could not move her right arm consistently, then not at all. She went to the emergency room at her community hospital and was immediately routed to Integris in Oklahoma City for emergency brain surgery to remove a tumor from the upper left side of her brain. The doctor was able to remove it, but remnants of the tumor remain, which doctors have diagnosed as Glioblastoma – a rapidly growing and spreading form of brain cancer. Brain surgery alone can run as high as $100, 000. She will have to undergo immediate aggressive cancer treatment and funding to help with this process is of utmost importance.American Brain Tumor Association - Glioblastoma Kris worked as a social worker as an advocate for the elderly at Oklahoma’s Adult Protective Services for four years. She left this job for another outside of social work to make more money. After a year, her new job left her feeling like she was not doing enough for her community, and she decided to go back to help Oklahoma’s ageing indigent population. She was only back in this job for a few months when this cancerous brain tumor forced her into this horrible financial crisis. Because Kris has only been back at Adult Protective Services for a few months, she is ineligible for short-term disability and has limited leave, which makes her need for funds immediate. She has insurance through the first of next year, but she most likely will not be able to continue working. Additionally, her hospital stay, surgery, and physical therapy were all at the end of this year, so her deductible and out of pocket costs begin again immediately in January when she starts her much-needed cancer treatment. Without working she will not be able to meet her mortgage and utilities, not to mention, pay for the insurance she will need for her treatment. Kris’ wife and son depend on her income to live.Please make a donation! Whatever we raise will help, not only financially, but by letting Kris know that there are so many people who care about and love her.",cd5972ba54000cc2e70110f3413b0a72,25,0.6344666666666666,30.0,2,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0017006802721088435,0.0,0.059093692590324556,1.16896501488331,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

I don't have any memories of him not trying to lighten the mood or make others happy. Unfortunately, right now Matt faces the toughest battle of his life as December 11th, and at only 27 years old, he was diagnosed with stage IV stomach cancer, which was unexpected and has started to spread to multiple places in his body, including his lymph nodes and intestines.This was a big surprise to all of us. This past September Matt started feeling flu like symptoms such as an upset/sore stomach, and vomiting. Many people started to notice his dramatic weight loss. As the days turned into weeks things started to get worse and more painful. Thankfully, Matt received a call that there was a cancellation and he was able to go a couple weeks early to see what was wrong with his stomach. We received the news he had cancer 6 days after that first appointment. We are fully prepared to gear up for the fight of our lives. It's gonna be very hard, but we are hoping to have lots of support and positive thoughts come our way. They don't say ""when the going gets tough, give up..."" so neither will we.

Annie would never ask for anything like this, but her dearest friends and I have set up this campaign to assist with expenses and to keep you updated on how she is doing. Funds raised will be used for uncovered medical bills, travel expenses and housing during treatments.She is now facing a long and complicated treatment plan that includes Campath injections three times a week, followed by TSEB (Total Skin Electron Beam Therapy) and then Stem Cell Transplants – a very long haul and one that we intend to take with her. Mass General Hospital in Boston is one of the few hospitals where she can receive the Campath. It is essential for Annie to stay close to the hospital even though it’s far from her home, family, friends and her beloved dog, Miles.Annie has uplifted many lives through her generous and hilarious spirit. She has volunteered as a Coastguard Auxiliary, ESL teacher, Triathlon for YMCA, Run for Safe Passage, and she and her therapy dog, Miles, provide affection and comfort to children and adults in hospitals and nursing homes. This is who she is – a woman who wants to be part of the solution and who brings hope into the hearts of others. Annie’s mission now is to help raise awareness of Sézary Syndrome which will undoubtedly lead to quicker diagnoses, less suffering, and better outcomes for others in the future.

It was expected to be nothing more than a torn muscle or maybe an old fracture. Only to find out a few days later that there was a bone tumor in his right femur. After learning of Jake's tumor, the following two weeks of testing were a nightmare for Jake's friends and family. On March 27, 2017, he was given a diagnosis that would change everything. At 22 years old Jake was told he had Osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer. The doctors at Yale New Haven Hospital swiftly formulated a treatment plan for Jake that involves intense inpatient chemotherapy, resection surgery, and then more post-op chemotherapy. Jake has already begun his chemo treatments. His doctors are hopeful that this treatment will arrest the cancer cells, and produce positive results. But there is a still long and uncertain road ahead of him.       The question ""why do bad things happen to good people?"" does not even begin to cover the karmic wrongness of Jake's circumstance. Being an amazing father to a beautiful two-year-old girl named Ava and a loving partner to his high school sweetheart Erin, should have made him exempt from the pain and suffering he is currently enduring. Anyone that knows Jake personally will tell you that he is a clever, strong, and good-humored man. He gives his time and kindness generously whether it is to his daughter who he adores more than life itself, or to the children that he cares for at Trinity Church. Jake also loved his job as a bartender at Buffalo Wild Wings in Stamford, CT. But sadly won't be able to return to work for the duration of his treatment.  It is in times like these that we are grateful for Jake's childlike charm and optimistic outlook. After all, he has been through he still jokes that maybe chemo will give him superpowers because that's just the type of guy he is...          As if Jake's diagnosis wasn't enough, he and his family now face the financial burden of his treatment. Loss of income, insurance deductibles, physical therapy costs, and the demands of raising a two-year-old, threaten this small family's financial security. We ask you to help Jake and his family in their time of need. Know that anything you are able to give is appreciated by Jake's friends and family immensely. We also ask that along with your generosity, you keep Jake in your prayers. ￼￼￼￼",6ef8dc766240e3e25cc3cddb04843a9d,24,1.06555,600.0,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

What is Ewing's sarcoma?This is one of the rarest types of cancerous tumors that grow in your bones or the soft tissue around your bones, such as cartilage or the nerves. It usually affects people between the ages of 10 to 20.Last year in October, two separate biopsies were done, she was given the devastating news that the mass was...cancer. After receiving her diagnosis, her Oncologist was prepared to start her treatment right away. In November, she started a chemotherapy regiment along with radiation that spanned over the following 6 months.  She was advised that the survival rate for this type of sarcoma was 5%, however, she persevered and beat all odds. She was given time off from her treatment to give her body time to recuperate as it was weak from chemotherapy.  Over that short period, she slowly lost feeling in her legs. She was rushed to the hospital where they found cancer cells pressing on her spinal cord.  An emergency spinal surgery was scheduled and performed as she would've been paralyzed without it.  Following the procedure, Renisa was sent to a rehab facility to help her regain mobility. While receiving her therapy treatment, the doctors overseeing her ordered an MRI and CT scan for the head, abdomen, and torso. The results were devastating...  Not only did she have a sinus infection which caused constant headaches, also a new tumor is pressing on the cervical region of the spinal cord. This caused semi-paralysis in the upper portion of her left arm. She was rushed back to the hospital as her symptoms are getting worse. Her oncologist recommended her to be put on Chemotherapy in the pill form and also a few sessions of radiation.Since her diagnosis, her family has been there for her physically, emotionally and also financially. Even with insurance, medical bills have been a financial burden. Her family has been stuck wondering ""How do you get help with medical expenses that aren’t covered?"" After Renisa received her diagnosis in October, she was told she would have 8 months to a year to live. Then at a follow up in December she was told a few months. In her most recent meeting, her Oncologist's nurse told her a few days to a week to live. Her family doesn't believe that! Renisa is a fighter and she won't let this cancer kill her. She has always been the selfless type that would give you the shirt off her back, who puts everyone in front of her. She was reluctant to even have this page set up for her as she would rather give than receive. However, she wants to get a second opinion but insurance only covers so much. There are a lot of companies out there that offer treatment but don't accept the health insurance that she currently has. Every day is a constant fight, Renisa wants to live more than anything in this world. She wants to beat cancer and be rid of it for good. There have been times where she feels to give up but is reminded that she has so much to live for. Family, friends and many loved ones who would love to see her live a long, healthy and prosperous life.  Never in a million years would Renisa or her family think they would need help but every does at some point. This page was created not only to raise funds to help with Renisa's medical bills, her living expenses and also any additional treatment. She has been unable to work since being diagnosed, so she isn't financially able to do much. They appreciate any amount of gifts you are able to extend to Renisa as she moves from this difficult time toward a full recovery, they ask for your generosity, your prayers, and good wishes.",9e9adbb73d7857dd88dc4d2c3b89acde,35,0.3711,540.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

This sudden news and ominous prognosis has shaken the Job family to the core, but as head, Dr. Job continues to be optimistic and brave as he now fights a daily battle to live. 

When Job learned of his diagnosis he quoted the following verse from Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar: 
“Cowards die many times before their deaths. 
The valiant never taste of death but once. 
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, 
It seems to me most strange that men should fear, 
Seeing that death, a necessary end, 
Will come when it will come.” 

Dr. Job often says that he never used his voice to promote himself or to earn a lot of money. He spent much of his life trying to change the culture of Trinidad and Tobago, educating and uplifting the minds of his fellow citizens. As a result, his illness has placed a great financial burden on his family. 

We are setting up this account in hopes that all who have been touched and inspired by him; family, friends, colleagues, peers, elders, good samaritans near and far, can help us mitigate the financial burden incurred by Dr. Job’s illness. At this time the family desperately needs funds to assist in the purchase of medications, as well as to cover his doctors’ appointments, travel, and 24x7 caregiving expenses. 

No amount is too small and any sum you are able to contribute will be a blessing. Copies of his book “Think Again” and his shorter writings such as ""Police Reform and Performance Management: Crime, The Derby Report and History"" are also available for purchase. For enquiries about these and other writings, for those who wish to do more than make a donation, please contact his daughter Dzifa Job at dzifanjob@gmail.com.  

 Contributions can also be made locally to Morgan Job at First Citizens Bank, Trinidad & Tobago. Account #860377.

We’ve all have been asking ourselves why her, how could this happen…she’s a perfectly healthy, 38 year old woman, who’s never smoked, with everything anyone could hope or ask for in life: a wonderful husband of 10 years, 3 beautiful daughters, and an amazing family and group of friends. What makes this situation even more difficult is that she’s 32 weeks pregnant with their fourth daughter.Here’s her story from my perspective…On December 13th, Mike and I received a phone call from Barbara (Ro’s mom) thinking she was calling to tease us about our Christmas card, but her tone was somber and serious, and what she was about to share with us caught us completely off guard. For the past week, Rochelle had apparently been suffering from a flu, thinking it was just a cold and would pass. However, the night after she thought it passed, she was awoken with an overwhelming headache and disorientation, causing her to be unable to take care of her three daughters, Azylnn (8), Mila (6), and Nyelli (2) while her husband Miguel was at work - Miguel has been an Albuquerque fireman for 12 years. Miguel immediately rushed home and decided to have her transported to Presbyterian Hospital as a precaution to make sure everything was okay with her and the baby. This is when life decided to throw a curveball - after some tests and an MRI, the doctors discovered a mass in her brain.No one can prepare you for a phone call like that…there were still so many questions to be answered. Mike and I looked at each other, each knowing that all we could do was hope and pray this was a false alarm…maybe a benign tumor, an error on behalf of the machine, who knows. What complicated the situation even further was the pregnancy, there’s only so many tests and diagnostics that can be preformed so as not to harm the unborn baby, and so we waited. Each day after that Tuesday brought only a couple more answers, the mass in her head was relatively small - around 1cm - which was good news and the doctors were able to do a biopsy. The results of the biopsy revealed that the mass was an abnormality and also led doctors to believe that the brain tumor could possibly be a byproduct of something else going on in her body. Mike called me on Friday December 16th, a phone call I’ll never forget, in tears blurting out that Rochelle had stage IV lung cancer……our worst fears had been confirmed.The next couple days were a whirlwind - that night Mike and his dad, Big Mike, immediately left for Albuquerque and I followed the next day - all we wanted to do was be with her and family. By the time I arrived at their home it was 3am, Rochelle had come home from the hospital and everyone was asleep. I can tell you from this experience that there’s no script or dialogue to follow when you find out someone has cancer, there’s no wrong or right thing to say, sometimes you’re just speechless, as most of us were in this case. When I saw her first thing that next morning, I just crawled into bed with her and we hugged and cried.That following week was filled with doctors appointments which continued all the way up to Christmas day. There were so many questions to be answered, but what we did know was that the baby was healthy and that they were able to schedule a lung biopsy for that week with the results coming in Tuesday after Christmas.So what did we do in the anticipation of results and answers, we came together as a family! My parents, Kathleen and Austin, drove out from LA, Celine (Ro’s sister) and her boyfriend, Ryan, flew in from Santa Cruz, and between all of us, including Miguel’s parents, John and Carmen, and of course Barbara, we helped in any way that we could. There was an outpouring of love and support from even more family and friends via phone calls, Facebook messages, text messages, care packages, and more. I’ve never seen a group come together so quickly as the Albuquerque Fire Department did to shower this family with love and labor, and lots and lots of food; these men were delivering food and Costco supplies around the clock! We spent Christmas Day in Santa Fe with Rosie and Carmelo (Ro’s grandparents), which was probably one of the most special Christmas’s we had ever had - all of us embracing each other with love and lots of prayers.Tuesday eventually came and we had another piece of the puzzle, the diagnosis. The doctors informed Rochelle that she had been diagnosed with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK ) Fusion Oncogene Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. It’s categorized as stage IV because the cancer has metastasized to her brain creating a small secondary tumor. Almost 40% of lung cancer patients have no symptoms until it has traveled to other parts of the body. As of now, there’s no trace of cancer in her blood, bones, liver, and adrenal glands, which are additional common places it can spread when you have lung cancer. I’m sure you’re wondering, but, once again, she’s never smoked. Unfortunately, 15%-20% of lung cancer patients are nonsmokers and the causes can range anywhere from occupational to environmental, and as of today, we do not know the cause. Apparently, lung cancer research has come a long way in the last 4-5 years, and there are new treatments being tested and discovered all the time. As for Rochelle, the current plan to treat the lung cancer is an oral drug called Alectinib and to address the mass in her brain they’ll perform Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS ). The doctors explained that this specific type of lung cancer is slower growing, so they feel confident delivering the baby at 36 weeks. As to how to ultimately deliver the baby, the doctors are still determining which delivery method will be the safest for both mom and baby, c-section or a natural vaginal birth.As we stand today, the overall prognosis for Rochelle is that her cancer is not curable, but TREATABLE with the goal being long term survivability. Many people have reached out asking how they can help and we’re hoping this Go Fund Me page will be part of the answer. The Tittmann Family has a long journey and fight ahead of them, and with the funds we raise here we hope to alleviate some of the financial burdens that come with a cancer diagnosis. Rochelle is an amazing stay-at-home mom and varsity volleyball coach for a local high school, and while she makes her health her number one priority, Miguel will be taking time off work to care for a newborn, their daughters, and support a recovering and healing wife. The ultimate goal is to help raise funds for their medical and household expenses, which they'll accrue during her treatments, in the hope that all Rochelle will have to do is focus on healing and ultimately knowing that this is one less thing she needs to worry about for her family.With that said, the new year is a time for reflection, change, and new beginnings, and a good reminder that we have so much to be thankful for each and every day of our lives.  No donation is too small!!  Please stay tuned for more information, stories, where your donations are going, and the long road ahead.  With your assistance we can all work together to help Rochelle in this time of need!Love you Ro,Sloane aka Soon-To-Be-Sister-In-Law#TeamRoBaby - Please visit her Facebook page for more info :)Azlynn (8), Miguel, Nyelli (2), Mila (6), RochelleSanta Fe Christmas 2016 from Left to Right, Back Row to Front Row:Miguel, NyelliTerri, Daniel, Big Mike, Rochelle, Barbara, Mike, Carmelo, Austin, RyanElizabeth, Sloane, Mila, Azylnn, Rosie, Kathleen, Celine",0d2c4105747931b630cde4a90eb12695,37,0.73937,750.0,3,1,0,1,1,1,1,0.0007220216606498195,0.0007220216606498195,0.808355091383812,1.0,1.0,0,0,1,0,Both,gofundme

He works faithfully everyday with his K-9 ""Ori"".        Approximately 5 years ago, Tony learned that he had a tumor growing behind his left eye. The tumor was removed, and he learned that it was benign.        Two years ago, Tony and his loving wife Meredith were blessed with triplets. Ethan, Logan, and Taylor have been providing constant entertainment and mayhem to deal with since their birth.       And, now for the reason you're here. This summer, Tony began having some issues with his left eye again. He went to the doctor and discovered that the tumor had returned, and that the ""cells didn't look good"". They removed as much of the tumor as possible and began testing. Unfortunately, this time, the tumor was cancerous. Tony went to a surgeon who specializes in head and neck cancers who reviewed all of his scans. It was determined that the cancer had spread to the bone around Tony's left eye. During the month of November, Tony will be undergoing a major surgery to remove his left eye, the effected bone, and the remainder of the tumor. He will then have to have some reconstructive surgery. Chemo and radiation are likely to follow.         At this time, we do not know how this will affect his career, but we do know that he will be out for an extensive period of time.

He adopted all of us and has never treated us as anything but his own children. He has sacrificed so much to take care of his family, which now includes 6 children. There was a time where he worked multiple jobs while going to college full time, just so he could support his family while allowing my mom to raise us at home. He has always put his family first and provided for us as much as he possibly could.


I remember the first time my dad told us he had colon cancer. I was about 13 years old, and when he announced the news I went to my room and cried. I didn't know what to expect, but I knew his father died from the same cancer, and I didn't want to lose my dad who has loved me so unconditionally. He had surgery, the cancer was treated, and all seemed well. We thought it was over, especially since the doctor told us his specific type of cancer doesn't usually come back.


Fast forward to the second time. The cancer came back even bigger. He had to have more surgery, and endured chemo treatments while still working to support is family and volunteering at our church. Seeing him so sick scared us all, and it was so hard on our family. My youngest sister, who was only a toddler, used to ask us all the time if ""daddy was gonna die"". Not only were we scared for our dad's health, but we were going deeper and deeper into debt because of the expensive medical bills. My mom all but lost her sanity, trying to care for her kids (which she home schools) as well as her sick husband, not to mention desperately trying to budget our money to afford basic necessities. But eventually, my dad recovered, his cancer was gone, and things went back to being fairly normal.


Until the third time. Now my dad has cancer in his lung. They are going to do more surgery to remove a part of his lung, and possibly more chemotherapy. He will have to take more time off work for the surgery, and he does not get paid leave. My parents' medical insurance has changed and they now have to pay almost twice as much for everything as they used to. They are still in huge debt trying to pay off the last round of cancer treatments.Unfortunately, it's now a year later and he's still fighting his cancer. It's now spread all over his lung and there's no longer any surgical options. He's been going through chemotherapy and radiation again, but things aren't going well and he's been really sick. It doesn't look like things are going to get better. 


 My dad doesn't deserve this happening to him again, he is such a good man and I hate to see him have to go through this again. It's hard enough going through cancer treatments without worrying about going into crippling debt over all these medical bills. They still have 3 kids at home, and one in college that they are still supporting. My dad always puts on a brave,  face, but I know he is worried too. I want to be able to ease some of their suffering by helping out with medical bills. So please, if you have any money to spare, it will be so appreciated.

Jeremy has a tumor on his lower left kidney that is called Renal Cell Carcinoma. The Urologist will preform surgery that will remove the tumor, causing him to lose about 1/3 of his kidney.  Jeremy also has a tumor in his chest cavity called a Foregut Cyst. This tumor is compressing a 5-6 cm area of his Esophagus, causing major pain his chest and breathing complications, making it almost impossible to eat or sleep. This is causing an internal hemorrhaging that explains all the symptoms he's had and continues to have. Our doctor also noticed a congenital sequestration on the CT scan from the ER. This means  that Jeremy's lower lobe of his right lung is getting it's blood supply from the abdominal aorta rather than the cardiac aorta, which is where it should be coming from. The doctor said this can cause major issues down the road and he would like to take care of it while Jeremy is already opened up for the Foregut Cyst surgery. This will entail rerouting the blood flow and removing the lower lobe of his right lung. Because Jeremy is relatively healthy and young, the doctor said it should not affect his lung function long term. Our doctor is having us move forward with the cancer surgery (Renal Cell Carcinoma) on November 20th to remove tumor on his left kidney. He will be preforming another surgery on Friday, December 14th to remove the Foregut Cyst and to correct the sequestration by removing the lower lobe of the right lung. All of these procedures combined will require a 12 day hospital stay and an 8-12 week recovery at home.

The protocol is a minimum stay of three weeks plus a return visit at a future date. I have spoken with the clinic at length and am excited about this new opportunity for healing.Thank you in advance for being a part of my journey!xo",b59665e482e1c25a6f091daf69efe869,11,0.07461,120.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

My name is Rose, and my family and I are asking you to please help save my brother John's life. John is 35 years old and is currently battling an aggressive, life-threatening brain tumor called a glioblastoma (GBM). The average prognosis for a GBM patient is 12-15 months. There is no standard treatment for recurrent brain cancer and this presents both a financial and medical challenge. John’s current treatment plan includes Avastin and Keytruda infusions, but these treatments are not curative, so we have been tirelessly searching for more options. Through outreach to many doctors and foundations, John has been offered an opportunity to participate in a new alternative treatment that is not covered by insurance. Please help John in his battle with brain cancer!In 2012, John was a typical 29 year-old living in Chicago, building a successful career, and engaged to the love of his life, Allyson. One day at work, John was in a meeting and very abruptly started seizing and was rushed to the emergency room. Everything changed for John and our family that day. John was diagnosed with an anaplastic astrocytoma, a type of brain cancer. He underwent an awake craniotomy which removed 60-70% of the brain tumor. Immediately after surgery, John started radiation, chemo, and adopted lifestyle changes which doctors and researchers thought would be helpful.(Here is John after his first surgery with his neurosurgeon, Dr. Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa (Dr.Q),  in 2012)From 2013 to 2017, the conventional treatments helped stabilize John’s tumor and John and Allyson started a family by welcoming first Dennis (now almost 4 years old) and then Matthew (now 1 year old). John continued to work, but also committed himself to encouraging others fighting for their lives through the Livestrong Foundation. He has spoken at and participated in numerous Livestrong events to help inspire others, all while continuing his own fight. (John, Allyson, Dennis (3), Matthew (1))Last May (’17), just a few weeks after Matthew was born, John went in for a routine MRI that produced devastating news; the tumor suddenly showed significant growth. This time the tumor was so aggressive that he started losing some of his vision and speech. In January (’18), John underwent his second awake craniotomy which was more invasive and painful than the first. The initial news was promising as Dr.Q and his team were able to get almost 90% of the tumor.(John in the ER on Christmas Eve 2017- always smiling!)However, the pathology results came back with the worst news to date- John’s recurrence was now a GBM. A month post-surgery the tumor had grown back to its original size, and a new tumor was found shortly after.  Despite all of this, John continues to be the most positive, empathetic and loving person you will ever meet. I think anyone who knows him agrees that he has a smile that is uplifting and a demeanor that can change the entire tone in a room. John is a fighter and he is determined not to lose this battle!

(Watch this video of John featured on the news as he was biking across Iowa at Ragbrai 2015. He talks about overcoming obstacles and staying positive!)This is where we need your help. John has serious vision and speech impairments which have ended his ability to work. Through outreach to many doctors and the foundations working to cure brain cancer, John has been offered a promising opportunity to participate in a new alternative treatment. Unfortunately, the treatment is not covered by insurance. The cost for this treatment is substantial, around $100,000, and the need to start is urgent! To date, John and Allyson have paid for all medical costs in excess of insurance, but this is more than our family can handle. Please know that we would not ask for this help if we did not feel it was completely necessary. By donating to this cause, you are helping my brother get the treatment he needs to keep fighting! Additionally, your donations will enable doctors to pursue these leading edge treatments in research that potentially could save others from this horrible disease. Any funds raised that do not go towards treatment will be put towards providing John’s young boys a secure future.Thank you in advance for all your love and support!(Family with Santa!

She has cycled through periods of metastasis and remission for the past two decades. The cancer has resurged aggressively and left her weighing in at barely 70 pounds.￼￼￼Every three hours she has to inject herself with morphine to deal with the dark pain of the tumors in her body. Every two weeks she enters the hospital for 10 days of chemo-therapy that leave her drained and barely able to walk, eat, or even talk.

She was in tears… A week later she found a glimmer of hope when she learned about the new treatment which has been approved in USA but not in Canada. Her Oncologist in Canada is also in agreement with the treatment. But there is a huddle…The cost of her treatment in US is approx. $250,000.

She has been seen at Pearson Cancer Center, UVA and Duke after continuous scans the cancer is only spreading. The cancer continues to grow in her lungs and she had spots on her brain recently as well as multiple lymph nodes. This past scan we were told she has exhausted all treatments and the only thing left to do is a trial that is located in Boston, MA. Mom was called last week and asked if she can come immediately as one of the three patients could not start the trial so as of Sept 12 mom & Fred will be traveling to Boston for this treatment. Since this is not a pharmaceutical trial they have to pay for their own lodging, travel, food etc while up there. It is an investigative trial through Dana Farber Cancer Center. She will have to be up there 35 – 40 days and then the trial will require her to go back and forth about 2x a month after she completes this first step. The average cost for a room with parking in Boston is around 400.00 but since she is being treated by Dana Farber she qualifies for a discounted, fully furnished facility that will only charge 189.00 a night plus 14.00 a day in parking. The cost to stay after taxes is going to be close to 10,000.00 not counting travel, food, and keeping up the bills back home. Mom is not the one to ask people for help and honestly she is going to be upset with me for doing this but I know that deep down she deserves it. Mom has always been the one to help EVERYONE and the last thing she needs to worry about right now is accommodations while she is doing a trial to hopefully stop the spread of this nasty disease.  My mom has remained positive throughout this whole ordeal, even after bad news after bad news. She will not give up and is going to go to Boston & Kick Cancer’s Butt. All proceeds raised will go directly to the lodging expenses for the duration of their stay to help ease the financial stresses that come along with this trial. We did not expect this to happen especially so soon and the last thing I want my mom to stress about is money. This is one of our last options for treatment, any donation, thought , prayer etc is greatly appreciated. God is on our side and I know he will see my mom through this no matter what.

She is a  mother of 4 children. Brayden (7) Nonah (5) Charlee (4) Ezra (3)She has had to suddenly stop working  after finding out the severity of her illness to focus on herself, her health and her family. Not only is this devastating in general, It is also Christmas adding to the devastation and heartache she is already enduring.This is her Story... On Novemeber 8th I under went a sinus surgery to remove what was thought to be a polyp, surgery was a success and I was sent home to recover. On November 16th I went in for what I thought was a typical post op appointment. It was then I was informed my biopsy came back as squamous cell carcinoma, a cancer that left untreated would be hard to treat but all around an easy to treat cancer. I was informed my biopsy was sent to Mayo Clinic for confirmation and to collect more information on the exact type of cancer. The 2 week wait was the longest wait of my life.On November 27th I went in to meet with my Oncologist to discuss Mayo Clinics findings and to get a plan to kick this cancers butt!!! It was then that I was informed that the type of cancer that I have is called NUT MIDLINE CARCINOMA, A very rare, very aggressive and very hard to treat form of cancer with a very low survival rate. I was told the tumor was in my head and extends to the roof of my mouth. I would first need to see if this is operable and then would need to go for very intense immediate treatment. Due to the type of cancer and its rarity I was referred to Froedert to meet the Oncology Team.On November 28th I went to Milwaukee to meet with what felt like millions of Doctors, had things shoved in my nose and a lot of reviewing my prior scans BUT mostly a lot of reassuring words. I met the team of Doctors that will help rid me of this cancer.. I have yet to have my pet scan, MRI or CT scan since my prior surgery so with that being said it is very hard to determine what my treatment plan will be until we figure out how much of the Tumor is left inside of me. As many people know, Insurance is a tricky thing so we now have to wait to schedule all of these things until we get prior authorization from my insurance. While I wait they are keeping me comfortable. Friends, Family and Strangers I ask you all to Pray, Pray it hasn't spread, Pray she can have one more surgery and follow it up with radiation and that she can be done with this devastating chapter.

Diane is an amazing wife and mother of three strong and loving men.  She treasures the time she gets to spend with her precious granddaughter, Julijana, and lives for making memories with her family and her many wonderful friends.On November 27, 2015, Diane was diagnosed with breast cancer.    Her journey has not been an easy one, but her tenacity, zest for life and  faith have been a source of great strength, helping her to face it head on.  Diane underwent her first chemotherapy treatment on December 28, 2015.  Treatments continued through June of 2016, followed by a double mastectomy in July.  She continued her treatment plan and began radiation treatment in  September.  All with the dignity and grace of one of the strongest women we had all ever encountered.On Wednesday, November 9th, our Zumba family welcomed Diane back to the dance floor, as she had just finished her final treatments the prior week and could not wait to get back to dancing – something that filled her heart and soul with abundant joy!  It was a wonderful feeling hugging Diane that day before and after class, knowing that she had endured so much, but had exhibited such strength, and it seemed she had conquered her battle.In mid December, Diane and her family received the news that they had hoped and prayed for the past year.  Diane was cancer free!Then, tragedy struck.  Less than one week after her joyous celebration of being cancer free, Diane was stricken with a debilitating migraine that landed her in the emergency room.   She was taken to Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh, where test and scans were soon underway.  The results were not something anyone was prepared for.  Diane’s journey is not over and has become even more complex, as the doctors found twelve cancerous lesions on her brain.  Due to excess fluid and swelling (the cause of the migraine), an emergency surgery to insert a shunt was performed.  Since, there have been complications forcing Diane to return to Presbyterian Hospital and fight harder than ever.Still, Diane fights like a champion!  It goes without saying that this  is an extremely difficult time for Diane and her family,  and will take great strains, not only physically, but emotionally and financially on her and her family.  Due to Diane’s constant needs, her husband, Mike, is unable to work so that he can be by her side when she needs him most.    At a time like this, positive energy is so important, and this campaign will help Diane feed off the positive energy of her closest family and friends and know that she or her husband does not have to worry about medical bills piling up.  Our Zumba family has raised monies in the past for prior students and friends by coming together in dance.  And although we just know we will be dancing with Diane again, we also know that time is of the utmost importance right now, as her diagnosis is aggressive . I'm asking you for many prayers and an enormous amount of positive energy as she faces the battle ahead. With that I will also ask you to give with your heart at this most gracious and loving time of year.  No donation is too small.   Won’t you please help this courageous woman move forward in her fight with the strength, love and respect she most deserves.Thank you in advance for your loving support.  It means the world to me, and of course Diane and her family, that you would help her in her most delicate time.  This is a family that believes strongly in ""paying it forward"".  I would like to take this opportunity to invite all of you to do the same.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  I will keep you updated on Diane’s progress.",781b308638515bf0660c642815249616,35,0.819,750.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

For those of you that do not know over the last few months Curt had been experiencing excruciating back pain keeping him from normal every day function and activity. He has spent the majority of his time in the hospital over the last month. On June 22nd we were blind-sided with devastating news as he was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma. Multiple Myeloma is a hematological (blood) cancer that develops in the plasma cells found in the bone marrow.  It is a very debilitating condition, and 9 rounds of radiation and pain medications have not even begun to touch the pain he is experiencing. Curt was discharged from Genesys hospital Wednesday July 5th and sent home with heavy pain medications to try and manage the pain. Those prescribed medications nearly killed him and Friday morning July 8th during a second opinion consult at U of M Hospital in Ann Arbor he was immediately sent to ER for an unintentional overdose where he was placed on a Narcan IV drip for opioid reversal. It was a very scary 48 hours to say the least. Doctors  are now trying to best figure out a way for him to be at home and manage his pain prior to his treatment plan.Unfortunately, because of Curt’s condition he will be unable to work and someone will need to be with him at all times to help him get around until we can get him well again.  We are desperate at this point to find him pain relief and will do whatever it takes to help him.  As we all know chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, and other life-saving treatments are both difficult and costly.  We have the fight of our lives on our hands right now and Curt will need all the help he can get with medical bills, experimental drugs, alternative treatments, travel expenses etc. It has been very difficult to watch him in such horrific pain and not be able to do anything to help. So many of you have reached out asking how you can help this wonderful man, outside of your prayers. Our road ahead is long but we will pray, stay focused and remain positive that Curt will be well again. Supporting him with whatever you can give to help relieve the financial burden would be greatly appreciated, even if it's just a prayer or a share. With financial assistance, our family can focus on getting him healthy and strong.We truly appreciate all the prayers, love and support from all our family and friends that have reached out to us over the last month. Thank you! We are beyond blessed to have you all in our lives. Please keep Curt and our family in your prayers.God Bless you all!Curt, Erika, Gavin & Nolan",ab8917ab92f46c6605c0a4dc9a6b442d,21,0.7548666666666667,540.0,6,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0019880715705765406,0.0,0.6355344764684422,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

Two days ago, Mimi was diagnosed with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL). ALL is a cancer that starts from the early version of white blood cells called lymphocytes in the bone marrow. The term “acute” means that the leukemia can progress quickly, and if not treated, would probably be fatal within a few months. Fortunately for Mimi, the cancer was detected within a few weeks of her feeling symptoms like extreme fatigue, leg cramps, loss of appetite and overall weakness. She was admitted into the hospital under the impression that she is anemic, and after a painful process of extracing blood cells from her bone marrow, the doctors at UCLA Research Center came back with different results. Mimi woke up with a confirmation of what she [being the smart nursing student that she is] knew was the case - she had cancer. Like any cancer, the process is long, tiring, painful, emotional, scary, crazy, overwhelming, exhausting, unpredictable, shocking and a number of other things no one can prepare themselves for. And cancer is also very, very expensive. Mimi will be at the UCLA Research Center for a month, receiving a number of expensive drugs and procedures, including chemotherapy (she was a total trooper through her first session – the most painful one. Go Mimi!) The best thing we can hope for is that she goes into remission and never comes out. But if she does come out, she is going to need a stem cell transplant (from her little hero brother Dylan). We pray that's not the outcome, but we also want to be prepared for the worst – mentally, physically, spiritually, and of course financially. Anyone can imagine the suffering of two parents not being able to take their child's pain and troubles away, not being able to trade places for the sake of their child's well-being, and not being able to predict what's coming next. But they are strong and remain positive, hopeful, supportive, and right by Mimi's bedside everyday. This also means not going into work for quite some time and unfortunately, you don't get a pass from your monthly bills, daily living expenses, or the medical bills to come after she beats(!) this awful disease. This is where we come in!Cancer is not contagious, but our fighting spirit is.Please join our family and friends in this battle for Mimi to overcome ALL. Whatever dollar amount you can contribute, be it $1 or $10, will greatly help the Gasparyan family through this difficult time. If you're unable to donate, we just as much appreciate you sharing this with your friends and social media followers, keeping Mimi in your prayers, sending positive vibes out into the universe, or simply wearing a bit more orange today – it all counts.

My mom, Lisa was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. She’s now completed for second for six rounds of chemotherapy which will be followed by her surgery, five weeks of radiation, and then six more months of chemo to follow.It’s all so surreal. You hear about people and families affected by cancer and subconsciously, you never think it’s going to happen to you or your family... until it does.For those of you that know my mom, know that my sister Kristy and I are all the family here that she has. We are a tight knit trio of women who have truly been through hell and back together. For those of you who know Lisa, know that she was the entire neighborhoods second mother and that she lived for us kids growing up. She gave her life, energy, money, and time to us day in and day out because she genuinely enjoyed it. Shes been a pillar in every school and every community she’s ever been a part of. Between the franklin park park district, to school trips and the music departments, from the PTA to being a devoted dance and softball mom, our schedules were her schedule. She has a heart of gold and has really gone through some things in her life that no one should ever have to go through. And just when you think you’ve hit bottom and are trying to get back up... you hear the word cancer and your name in the same sentence. No one deserves the amount of stress this puts on a body, much less a woman in her late 50s who is waiting tables and rebuilding her life brick by brick.We are prideful and stubborn German women, so by nature we don’t ask for help- ever.But this time is different. This time my moms life is at stake... and we’re going to need some help. It’s extremely expensive to be sick in this country now-a-days and the bills are going to start coming in full force. My sister and I are working twice as much now and filling our schedules with anything that’ll pay, but we know that it won’t be enough. And in my opinion, in order to really give this fight everything she’s got, she needs to only work when her body will allow and shouldnt have to have the stress of bills on her shoulders on top of it all.I’m asking my friends, family, acquaintances, and colleagues: please help if you can. No donation is too small, and I’ll never be able to thank everyone enough for all the outpouring of love we’ve gotten so far. My mom has worked her entire life to help make mine and my sisters dreams come true, and her dream is to be able to meet her grandkids one day.

He saw a few doctors but they all said he was fine. Recently, he went to have a scan done of his nasal cavity and the scan showed a block so they performed surgery to remove it. After removing the blockage, a biopsy was then done.  A few days later, the results came in. My 19 year old brother was diagnosed with a very rare  (only 17 cases ever recorded) form of cancer, Sinonasal carcinoma, a newly described sinonsal tumor type that is characterized by a total absence of SMARCBI expression. Experience is limited with this tumor type. Many, but not all have behaved aggressively. After receiving the results from the nasal biopsy, a brain scan was done to be sure the cancer hadn't spread. Unfortunately, the Scan showed a tumor in the brain. Conner will be flying to Houston August 28, 2016 and staying at MD Anderson Cancer Institute for treatment, which includes surgery to remove the tumor from the brain, radiation, and possibly chemotherapy.  The reason I have created this page is because Conner has had to take a leave of absence from his job at the Naples Bay Resort and the health insurance Conner has, will only pay if treatment is completed in Naples/Fort Myers. At only 19 years old, and having such a rare form of cancer, the best option is to be in Texas for treatment. Contributions and prayers are greatly appreciated, and will go directly to Conner.

Before anything, let me introduce to all myself, My name is Anthony and I am AJ ‘ s 3rd big brother, 2 year old gap between her and I and been together through the good times and the bad times…yup, we  are just as normal as a brother and sister can be. But this I can tell you for sure, that my sister is the KINDEST, MOST LOVING, SWEETEST, ENCOURAGING, COURAGEOUS , FEISTY , A FIGHTER, INTELLIGENT, A LOVING DAUGHTER, A DOTING SISTER (especially to me), SELFLESS (putting others before her own needs). 

I can go on and on and on describing to all AJ and not because she’s my sis but friends, colleagues and co-workers can attest to how GREAT she really is. She may be short in stature but as they say great things come in small packages. (… I know now what to get her for Christmas…something small)

Graduation 2011, me and AJ

But seriously, her heart is as BIG as a Polar Bear. She definitely is a FIGHTER and there’ s no doubt in our minds that she will BE VICTORIOUS in her fight with the Big C.

Birthday 2014, with family and friends

I know that everyone is asking how they can help. Your Prayers are still very much needed but we all know that this fight is not only draining on her physically, emotionally, and mentally but also financially.

Knowing my sister, she is not the type to ask for financial help, but upon our prodding and explaining to her that since she’s not working as of the moment and her insurance only covers so much then this is another option she has to help curb with her increasing expenses and debts.

We ask for your monetary contributions to assist with her medical and other bills during her treatments. Her surgery has put her out of commission for 8 weeks now. The Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy is estimated to last 6-8 months. 

We also have a Facebook page going:  https://www.facebook.com/ArleneJoyBeatsCancerSupport/ Please don't hesitate to continue reaching out to us. Your love, prayers and positive vibes are not only felt but also so appreciated. 


We thank you in advance for all your generosity.

Any amount you can manage will definitely go a long way, whether it be a $1 or a simple click to the “SHARE”/""LIKE"" button on FACEBOOK.


AJ's road to recovery will likely be long, and this will help immensely in easing the burden. We appreciate the outpouring of love, support and prayers during this time of need.

We know AJ (""Babes"" as fondly called by family) would never want you to feel obligated, so please only give if God is leading you in your heart to help our sister out during her time of need.

At 26 years old, Jonny Imerman was diagnosed with testicular cancer and began his fight against the disease. Throughout his experience, Jonny was lucky enough to have loving support from his family and friends but had never met anyone his age who was a cancer survivor. He wanted to talk to someone just like him, someone who truly understood, and was intimately familiar with his experience. In short, he was looking for someone who had already faced the same type of cancer. This was the beginning of Jonny’s vision and in 2003, it became a reality when he founded Imerman Angels.Thank you and much love to you all!Frank  https://imermanangels.org/about-us-2/",dfd1bdf83389b3a18310faec8e45ee24,10,1.5536666666666668,120.0,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

In Canberra with his family and girlfriend by his side he was told that he has colon cancer (Bowel cancer) that had spread to his liver, lungs and brain. Robert will now have to fight to survive, with radiation and the most aggressive course of chemotherapy in the world planned for the rest of the year.  The doctor sat down with Robert and asked him about his life, about his goals. Robert chatted his ear off with his ideas. The doctor with a tear in his eye said that he was too young for this, he then said something that left the room in silence. If you have a reason to live and a purpose, I’ll keep you alive to achieve it. Robert smiled and said I have a life- long list.Robert was diagnosed only days before he was due to fly out on his dream trip through India and Nepal. The purpose of the trip this time was to do more than to satisfy his thirst for adventure but to source a loose-leaf tea supplier to start his little paddocks project on his property in Mogo.Those that know Robert would know his love for gardens, design, fresh produce, antiques and artistic collaboration. It was these elements infused with Robert’s passion for natural remedies that began to inspire Robert to design a tea house surrounded by fields of herbal tea and a large workshop where local artists could collaboratively work on their craft and sell their products lease free. The paddock also intended to become a hub for natural therapies. Robert has always said that this is not just for him, it’s for everyone, it’s the start of a healthier, connected and supportive community on the south coast.The project concept is one that Robert has been brewing for years, with plans and designs ready to pour. Yet his savings are now being spent on living expenses and treatment, with no health insurance and an inability to work. While on chemotherapy Robert’s family will be doing all they can to cover the basic costs. The goal, and the reason to fight, becoming harder and harder to reach each and every day since his diagnosis.Sadly, Robert and his families’ lives have come to a sudden stop but this does not mean that the bills and living expenses will do the same. It is the ongoing cost of transport to and from his chemotherapy sessions along with trips to Canberra for his radiation, Phone, electricity and so on. All the things that we take for granted in our everyday working lives.I am asking you all to get behind Robert and his family to make Roberts dream and purpose a reality and not limit his fight and options for alternate treatments to a financial matter.

Pero la triste realidad , esque nuestra Mamá lo ocupa más que nada en este momento. Liduvina es hija, Hermana, esposa , mamá , abuela y tía. Sea lo que sea ella es muy amada! Crió 6 hijos que la bendicieron con 9 nietos , que por suerto son su adoración y no hay momento alguno que ella no les demuestre su amor incondicional al igual como tia a sus sobrinos. Estamos muy agradecidos de tenerla con nosotros apesar de todo.

Por 7 años , ella a estado batallando con un dolor en su abdomen y vientre. Por esos 7 años, ella entraba y salía del hospital esperando que le dieran respuestas el porque tenía tanto dolor. Fueron varias veces que fue rechazada y mandada a su casa con medicamentos que paraban el dolor por un rato pero no tenía respuestas de el porque.  En Mayo 6,2018 fue la primera vez que por fin tuvo una respuesta que cambió todo por completo.

Su dolor fue demasiado fuerte que espero que su familia se durmiera para no preocupar a nadie. Se fue al hospital sola para recibir la lamentable noticia que pudiera tener cancer. Después de varios exámenes de sangre y incluyendo un CT , el CT resulto con tumores en su abdomen bajo. Alas 2 am siguiendo sola , recivio la terrible noticia que probablemente era cancer. Fue admitida al hospital para continuar con los exámenes y asegurar que si era cancer. Rodiada por su familia esperando anciosamente por los resultados y con fe, fue translada a un hospital en donde aceptaban su aseguranza. El hospital a donde fue transladada, repitieron los examenes y una biopsia. Desafortunadamente recibimos la lamentable noticia de que si era cancer. Pero el tipo de cancer todavia no estaba confirmado. Unos días despues , regresó al hospital para un procedimiento que pudiera contestar nuestras preguntas sobre el cancer. Cuando el Dr. hablo con nosotros , nos aseguro que iba estar bien , siguiendo el plan de tratamiento incluyendo las Quimioterapias. Nos confirmó que teníe cancer de ovarios etapa 3C que no tan solo abia avansado y fue detectado antes de que llegara a sus pulmones causando que fuera etapa 4. Desde que comenzó las quimoterapias sus tumores han encogido y aseguran que el quimo está funcionando. Cuando finalmente todo iva bien , ella se encontro en el hospital nuevamente por una fuerte tos. Después de varios exámenes, le confirmaron que tenía pneumonia. Gracias a dios después de antibióticos está bien. Desafortunadamente nos queda una larga batalla para estar bien! Tendrá una cirugia y le quedan unas sesiones de quimioterapias, pero gracias a dios estamos muy agradecidos y afortunados de tenerla aun  con nosotros. Como ustedes se pueden imaginar , luchar contra el cancer es muy costoso. Desde que fue diagnosticada con cancer no pudo trabajar y su aseguranza sólo cubre sierto porcentaje del tratamiento.

English:  Hello friends and family we know asking for help is never easy and we wish we didn't have too. But the fact of the reality is that we do need help for our mother. Liduvina is a daughter, sister, wife, mother, grandmother, and an aunt. No matter what she is, she is loved. She raised six kids, who have given her nine grandchildren. Her grandchildren are her world, and showers them with unconditional love. She is also the aunt to many nieces and nephews who she shows that same love. Her family truly is the most important thing to her, and we are all grateful to still have her. For the past seven years she has been having pain in her lower abdomen. Through those seven she has gone to the hosptial several times and left with no answer to what was causing the pain. Too often she was turned away with little to no test performed, pain pills were prescribed and she was sent home. Seven years her pain and concerns were neglected. May 6th, 2018 she got her first real set of answers. Her pain was so bad, she waited for her family to go to bed, so she could drive herself to the hosptial. she didn't want anyone to know she was in pain, so they would not worry about her. Alone in the hosptial she went through a series of test including a CT scan. The CT scan showed some masses in her lower abdomen. At 2AM still all alone, she was told that she may have cancer. She was admitted to the hosptial for further testing. Surrounded by her family we anxiously awaited for the test results only to be told they don't know what is wrong and she needed to be transferred to a different hospital that accepts her insurance. The new hospital repeated some of the same test and performed a biopsy. She was told she did indeed have cancer but the stage and form were uncertain. A few days later she went back to the hosptial for a surgery that would allow doctors to insert cameras inside her abdomen to see where the cancer was and what stage. She was in surgery for hours with her family waiting in a room for the doctor to call. The doctor called and informed us the surgery was succesfull, but he would have to come speak with us. She was diagnosed with Stage 3c ovarian cancer. Not only had her cancer spread, the cancer was caught just before it spread to her lungs, which would have turned the cancer into stage 4. Her doctor developed a treatment plan starting with chemo the following week. Since then she has gone through four rounds of chemo, and another CT scan. The CT scan showed her tumors are shrinking and the chemo is working. Once everything started looking up, she found herself in the hospital yet again due to a bad cough. She had test ran and was told she has pneumonia. Luckily after some antibiotics she will be okay. She still has long road ahead of her. She needs another surgery and an unknown amount of chemo. It is by the grace of God she is still her with us. As you can imagine fighting cancer is expensive. Since being diagnosed with cancer, she has been unable to return to work. She does have insurance, but it does not cover much, so she is left with the burden of trying to figure out how to pay for her hospital bills. Anything you can give is appreciated, even if it just a share.",d93ec11844f602d145612c23fb7c7fea,72,0.09583333333333334,150.0,2,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.00089126559714795,0.0,0.9507209633972429,1.3081569360175724,0.0,1,0,0,0,Battle,gofundme

I am a family friend of Leigh White & Mr. & Mrs. Rufus Boutwell. Leigh’s son, Tyler McMahon (19YOA), was recently diagnosed with throat cancer. Tyler is a young man and supporting a family of his own, a one year old daughter- Anslee and girlfriend- Kylee. No one ever, at any point in their life, has time for cancer. Tyler is no exception. Tyler’s mother, Leigh, is a superior mother and would give anyone the shirt off of her back with no questions asked. I took the initiative to start this fund to hopefully take some burden off of this family, both financially and emotionally. Please read below words from Leigh White:“Thank you all SO very much. Armand and I have received numerous visits, calls, and texts with prayers and questions about Tyler and his shocking diagnosis. At the beginning of 2017 Tyler mentioned he had a sore throat. I’m not one to rush to the doctors office every time, so I passed it off. I mean really, a sore throat? I offered Tylenol, Motrin and cough drops and told him it would get better. He complained again, and again. As time passed, mid-year, he began to complain of an earache and jaw pain. I thought back and remembered the excruciating pain I felt when my wisdom teeth needed to be surgically removed. I mentioned to him it may be a possibility but again he shrugged it off. And looking back, I guess we all did. The pain started changing and he started feeling like something was in his throat, a little tickle. When you have a 19 year old (male) let me express how difficult it is to get them to do anything and especially to seek medical attention. You can not make them go to the doctor. You can’t pick them up and take them like you would a two-year-old or even a nine-year-old. Kylee, Tyler’s girlfriend, expressed her concern and that she also thought he needed to be seen. But honestly, everyone passed it off...again. In November, Tyler’s pain worsened, he felt like he had a lingering case of strep and once again I asked him to make an appointment. I begged. During Thanksgiving Tyler showed everyone a “growth” in the very back of his mouth and being the google generation we googled our findings. Could it be his tonsils growing back? His adenoids? Maybe an abscess? I distinctively remember saying “Dad (Armand) works very hard to supply you with the best Medical Insurance, so please use it!” Over the next few days his pain worsened and he began have trouble swallowing. Tyler finally called and made himself an appointment with our longtime, family physician. When he told me of his appointment and that he actually called himself, I felt anxious. I was worried. December 22, 2017 he was seen by PA Lisa Plock and she immediately referred him to an ENT because she had “never seen anything like that before”. Christmas passed, New Years and Tyler was seen in the office of ENT Dr. David Walters on Tuesday, January 9, 2018. Dr. Walters scoped Tyler through his nose and down his throat. He was able to see the “growth” clearly and Tyler was very specific as to where the excruciating pain was. Dr. Walters scheduled Tyler for a CT and biopsy the following week and sent us on our way. The next morning (Jan. 10) Tyler called me at sunrise and said he needed to go to the ER, his pain was no longer tolerable. I called Dr. Walters office, left a message and immediately Dr. Walters himself called me back. He said he was VERY concerned and didn’t want to wait a week for the CT “just in case something is really wrong”. He said he was directly admitting Tyler into St. Francis Hospital, immediately doing a CT and performing the biopsy the next morning after IV antibiotics. After surgery January 11, Dr. Walters came into the waiting room to discuss his findings. When I saw his face, I knew. Armand calls me “NegativeNancey” but a Mama just knows. The pathologist on site couldn’t confirm or deny his findings so the “snippets“ were being sent off and would be back in 3-5 business days. Dr. Walters was upbeat, positive and he was realistic. I’ve been around numerous doctors in my life and being the sole caregiver of my 88 year old grandmother we see lots of doctors but Dr. Walters is by far the best. He is compassionate, understanding and has literally sat with my son and I for hours, talking and explaining in detail, attempting to lesson our fears and anxiety. He assured me if we acted quicker, not “passed it off it” like we did, the outcome would’ve most likely been rounds of antibiotics and the “C” not found until now. The next 6 days crept like a snail crossing the Sahara. Thursday (January 18) at 12:54pm Tonya called from Dr. Walter’s office. The results were in but we needed to come into the office to discuss them. “Anytime there is bad news you go in” and “if it was good news you’d say so”, I told her. She apologized as I cried. Yesterday morning we were told “Low Grade Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma”, our otherwise healthy, 19 year old (20 in April) son, has throat cancer. This Tuesday, January 23, Tyler will be assessed by Dr. Mihir R. Patel at Emory in Atlanta, Georgia and his surgery date will be confirmed. With God’s help, ALL cancer will be robotically removed from our child’s body and Tyler will be a walking testimony to our Lord. Please continue your prayers. We feel them and they feel good.”This GFM was created to assist Tyler with medical bills for treatments as well as living costs for himself and his family as he is the primary provider in his home.

He and his wife, Vanessa, had recently welcomed their first child, a beautiful baby boy named Weston to the world. The musical that Sam had been working on for over a decade had just been accepted into a prestigious theatre accelerator program. There was so much to be grateful for…Midway through January, Sam began to experience headaches and he had lost 10 pounds. He figured the headaches were caused by the lack of sleep that came along with his new role as Daddy, and the weight loss seemed like it could easily be the byproduct of a busy schedule – Sam had spent the better part of 2018 going back and forth to Vermont to care for his ailing mother, Marianna. He helped her make the move to assisted living and he cleaned out the family home of 50+ years – no small task, indeed.On Thursday, January 17th, as his headaches grew stronger, Sam decided to go to the doctor. The doctor thought the pain might be sinus-related so he ordered a CT Scan. The scan revealed a mass on Sam’s brain. Within a day, he was in brain surgery. Unfortunately the tumor was too intertwined so the surgeons couldn’t remove it. By Sunday, Sam and Vanessa were informed that the cancer in his brain had metastasized from his lungs. Further scans showed the cancer was also in his liver, spine, and jaw.In the face of this devastating news, Sam and Vanessa have been incredibly strong and positive. Humor and laughter, which have been a huge part of Sam’s life, will undoubtedly help him with what lies ahead. Just hours after being diagnosed, Sam was cheering on his beloved New England Patriots in his hospital room. When the nurse asked him to “cheer quieter,” Sam politely nodded. When the nurse left the room, Sam turned to Vanessa and his friends and said, “What are they gonna do? Kill me?”Sam is, simply put, a sweet, kind, and generous soul. Through his music and acting, and most of all his friendship, he has blessed all of our lives immeasurably. Throughout his wonderful life, including his more than 30 years in Los Angeles, Sam has perfected the fine art of friendship. So many of those friends have reached out, wanting to know how they can help support him and his family during this difficult time. As Sam and Vanessa face the challenges ahead, they will both have to put working on hold. There will be a range of medical, childcare, and other expenses.

Only 2 months ago my sister Bec Lancaster-Scully was a happy and healthy 36 year old woman living on the beautiful Gold Coast with her husband Joel & two beautiful boys Will, 5 and Kit, 1.Just before Christmas 2018 Bec suffered a series of migraines and doctors found 2 tumors. At the end of January 2019 Bec underwent brain surgery to remove one of the tumors, the other cannot be removed due to it being on her brain stem. She has since been diagnosed with Grade 4 - primary glioblastoma with a rhabdoid subtype AKA brain cancer.  The average survival time is 12-18 months with only 25% of glioblastoma patients survive more than one year, and only 5% of patients survive more than five years. What makes Bec’s story so incredibly sad and unique are the challenges her and Joel have faced over the past 6 years. Will was born in May 2013 with a heart condition that required heart surgery. He spent 7 weeks in hospital until he was strong enough to undergo the surgery.

While she was there, she developed a persistent cough which prompted her to go in and get it checked out. The doctors broke the news that Lia had stage 4 colon cancer which had already spread to her liver and lungs. Lia was forced to end her adventure in Korea and returned home to Appleton and begin chemotherapy in June of 2018.Several months following Lia’s chemotherapy treatment, Lia reached out to Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee for a second opinion. Though it was a difficult decision, she decided to continue treatment in Appleton as she felt that being closest to her support system--her family and friends -- would give her the encouragement she needed to fight this disease.Currently, Lia has been having difficulty breathing on her own.  She is relying heavily on oxygen and has been in and out of the hospital in the past month due to her breathing issues in addition to infections.  Because of these complications, her oncologist has stopped her chemotherapy treatments. It has been about two months since her treatments have been discontinued and her condition is not improving.  Her oncologist has recommended that she not undergo any further treatments, but per Lia’s wishes, she still has the will to fight! She has persuaded her oncologist to prescribe an alternative oral chemotherapy medication to trial. However, the process of actually receiving the medication has taken longer than expected and she has not started the medication yet.  As her immediate family, we feel that she would be better cared for at a larger facility with more experienced doctors.  We are scheduled to meet with Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN on March 20th for a consultation, but we are hoping to get Lia in sooner with Virginia Piper Cancer Institute in Minneapolis.Lia is just 25 years young. She still has so many things to look forward to, people to meet, and dreams to chase. For those of you who know Lia, she is an independent, free-spirited, humble, positive human being. She is an ambitious person who always pursued her goals and dreams regardless of what others said. Even as she is battling cancer, she is still the strongest, most positive person we know. Every day is an opportunity for her, and she will not back down from this fight.Until now, she has only opened up to close family and friends. She didn’t want to feel like a burden to anyone. All expenses for consultations and treatment out-of-state would have to be out of pocket. Unfortunately, Lia’s insurance only covers one consultation and it was already used when we consulted with Froedtert Hospital. As her family, we are burdening you for monetary donations which will be used towards all her medical expenses. Please keep her in your prayers and help share her story. We thank you for your time and support.",6ddc9ab985b0aafa66f71ae4567363e6,24,2.05,5.0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Estelle est un des cas unique au Canada, concernant l'évolution de son cancer et la réception aux traitements. Elle est une mère de 4 jeunes enfants. Nous voulons ramasser des fonds pour l'aider ( à la fin du message les détails) Voici son histoire, notre histoire:Estelle, 38 ans, était une femme enjouée mère de 3 enfants Malyah 1 an, Emrys 3 ans et Nathaniel 5 ans, elle était enceinte de sa 4e quant à sa 27e semaine de grossesse en octobre 2017 elle a découvert sous son bras gauche une petite bosse. Elle est allée consulter, ils lui ont fait une biopsie pour lui apprendre que s'était une récidive à un mélanome qu'elle s'était fait enlever 3 ans plus tôt dans le dos, une simple grain de beauté qui avait changé de couleur. TOUT UN CHOC pour elle et toute notre famille!!! On lui dit que tant qu'elle n'aura pas accouché on ne pourra rien faire pour elle. La bosse grossit à vue d'œil alors son accouchement est provoquée à 37 semaines de grossesse. Félycia voit le jour le 5 janvier 2018. Son état va de mal en pire elle sera opérée le 11 janvier, pour lui retirer un tumeur rendu d'une grosseur d'un pamplemousse seulement 6 jours après son accouchement. Tout les espoirs sont permis nous la croyons sauvée. Elle continue malgré tout à prendre soins de ses 4 ENFANTS avec un drain sous le bras et des souffrances incommensurables. Après 1 mois sa plaie guérit et peu passer un TEP. Ils découvrent que le cancer s'est multiplié par le système lymphatique. C'est l'horreur son bébé à juste 1 mois et elle a ses 3 autres enfants. Un essai clinique non homologué par Santé Canada s'offre à elle l'Immunothérapie, la réponse des assurances est positive, les traitements débutent début mars à tout les 2 semaines pour prolonger sa vie et avoir la chance de voir ses enfants grandir. Son dermatologue est surpris des résultats, Estelle répond très bien aux traitements avec très peu d'effets secondaires, mise à part une très grande fatigue. Le printemps passe, les traitements continus elle reste forte, courageuse et présente pour les siens. À l'été les effets secondaires s'accentuent, elle continue de se battre même si elle a besoin de plus en plus d'aide. À l'automne elle repasse un TEP et tout est stable, nous voyons enfin une lumière au bout du tunnel! L'énergie revient elle semble de mieux en mieux, les traitements sont donc diminués au mois. On passe un beau noël ensemble comme avant. Début janvier 2019, Estelle se plaint de maux de ventre de plus en plus fréquent. Elle repasse un TEP le 4 février 2019 et BOUM le 5 février le ciel nous tombe sur la tête; son hématho-oncologue lui apprend la triste nouvelle une 3e récidive vient la happer. Une grosse tumeur à l'intestin  est apparue et la maladie est trop avancée pour l'enlever. Nous sommes dévastés!!! Une seule option s'offre à elle une autre sorte d'immunothérapie, un autre essai clinique, avec beaucoup plus d'effets secondaires cette fois-ci, la maladie doit arrêter de progresser, le temps presse.!!! Nous demandons votre aide afin que notre Estelle qui est âgée d'à peine 40 ans et ses 4 enfants de 1,3,5 et 7 ans puissent vivre dans un environnement adéquat et qu'Estelle puisse réaliser son rêve d'avoir une maison pour elle et sa petite famille. Présentement dans un petit 5 et demi avec la maladie et ses 4 enfants, l'un de ses rêves est de déménager dans une maison pour permettre à ses enfants d'avoir plus d'espace et pour elle d'avoir un milieu facilitant son quotiden et la gestion de sa maladie. Plus d'espace lui permettrait d'adapter son milieu de vie à sa réalité et d'accueillir l'aide nécessaire qu'elle aurait besoin au quotidien.Chaque petit geste et don compte. Nous vous en serons éternellement reconnaissant. MERCI de nous aider à prolonger la vie de notre sœur dans la quiétude et la sérénité. Estelle à tellement un grand cœur elle ne mérite pas ce qui lui arrive. Tout ce que nous voulons c'est un petit coup de pouce de votre part pour qu'Estelle puisse croire que dans la vie tout est possible et qu'ensemble nous pourrons apaiser son histoire.

Unfortunately the culture shock, unfamiliar food and extreme weather resulted in him loosing weight and other complications and he ended up in emergency in St Jo, who then transferred him to KUMC hospital in Kansas City.During his stabilization and investigations, KUMC hospital medical team diagnosed Mandeep with advanced stage of Neuro-Endocrine Cancer with a prognosis of a few months lifespan. Mandeep's student friends reached out to Indian Association of Kansas City to request for help as he was lonely and craved Indian food. Who in turn reached out to the Sikh community, so that we could alleviate his cultural shock by sending visitors who could speak to Mandeep in Punjabi, his native language. Mandeep was getting ready to head back to India to be with his family, depressed and resigned to his fate, but he was lucky enough that Dr Jaswinder Singh an Oncologist who is a part of local Sikh/Indian community decided to intervene, review his case and suggested that a treatment for his cancer was available (PRRT Therapy) that can significantly prolong Mandeep's life. The treatment will last approx a year and as Mandeep does not have the resources, the local Sikh/Indian community is rallying around him to provide accommodation and raise funds to maintain his status at the university, fund out of pocket costs of treatment and medicines as well as offer travel back to India so that he can see his family which currently is his greatest wish. We are making an appeal to the wider Indian Community to help with whatever small amounts of donations you can to give this young man a chance at a new life and hope to fulfill his dreams that he came to America for. Our goal is to get the funding in place over the next two weeks to help support Mandeep's treatment and stay here.Also as you are donating and believe in the worthy cause please share this campaign on your social networks, so that we can reach the widest list of donors possible and every small additional donation helps.Some folks have expressed concern about high 'tips' suggestion from GoFundMe page when they try to donate, I think it defaults to 10%, click on the dropdown arrow and you should see option of 'Other' choose this and you can decide what tip you wish to give to GoFundMe.Note: For those who wish to visit with Mandeep Singh and wish him well in person, the address is ""Gurudwara Nanak Darbar Sahib, 126 S Cherry St, Olathe, KS 66061"". Please be mindful that we will be restricting visits after he starts his treatment on 2/13, for 3-4 days, for Mandeep's and visitors safety reasons.

Your contribution and support for Kali during this difficult time is deeply appreciated. On December 27th Kali was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. This completely changed her life. In order to focus on what has become the biggest challenge she has ever faced, she is taking time off from work and essentially putting her life on hold. Coming to terms with breast cancer at the age of 32 is challenging to say the least. Minnesota has a great health care system, and Kali is confident in her treatment plan. She enrolled in an immunotherapy clinical study, which has given her access to cutting edge treatments and further testing. These tests include MRIs, CTs, and PET scans. The results from the first set of scans confirmed that the cancer is stage 2b. While still an aggressive form of cancer, it thankfully has not spread to any other areas of her body.Kali had her first chemotherapy infusion on January 28th, and these treatments will continue for 22 weeks. Following chemo, she will have surgery in August to remove the tumor and breast tissue. This surgery will likely be a full or partial mastectomy to reduce any chance of recurrence. There will be a recovery period after surgery, which may be followed by radiation therapy depending on further test results. Hormonal treatment is the last step and will continue for an undetermined length of time. Kali is fortunate to have health insurance to help pay for most of the medical costs associated with treatment; however, her monthly health insurance costs have increased. She has medical and pharmaceutical deductibles to pay, and other parts of this process that are not covered by insurance. These include fertility treatments, genetic counseling, and unforeseen additional costs. As there was no immediate family history of breast cancer until now, genetic counseling is especially important. It will help doctors determine which surgery will be most appropriate, and provide invaluable information to the other women in Kali’s family. Facing these financial burdens while battling cancer feels overwhelming. The money from this fund will provide financial relief in a challenging time. Kali’s friends can attest: Kali is one of the most caring, adventurous, supportive, and wise people you’ll ever meet. We have no doubt she’ll win this battle, but your help would mean a lot as she navigates this challenge. She can’t wait to return to happier times of hiking, traveling, and spending quality time with her friends and family. Any donation amount helps. Kali is so grateful for all the amazing people in her life.

Because my mother is now in an out-of-network hospital, our insurance will not cover most of the expenses. My father is not working right now; he stays with my mom day and night, only coming back home to shower. He sleeps on a chair in the room with her. Even after my mom wakes up from intubation, he still won't return to work for a couple of months so he can be my mom's caregiver at home. We have no other relatives here as they are in the Philippines. It is just my dad, mom, my sister, and me here in the USA. The $100,000 will be used for the hospital bills and future treatment at UCSF and Stanford if the chemotherapy does not work.Near the end of 2018, my mom wasn’t feeling well. She had a hard time breathing and was cold all the time. She went to urgent care—no x-ray was taken.  They given antibiotics and a nebulizer. After weeks went by, she continued to get worse. We went to urgent care again. They took an x-ray. Then we got a call from her doctor saying that she needed to go to the ER because he said she had pneumonia and there was a dark shadow on her lungs. At the hospital, they realized she had fluid in her lungs and pericardial cavity. She also had multiple nodules throughout her lungs. After a thoracentesis in which they extracted 600 mL from her lungs, the results from the fluid came back. On January 31st, 6 weeks after my mom first fell ill, she was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. Her right upper lobe has already collapsed. My maternal grandmother was a heavy chain smoker, but my mom has never smoked a cigarette in her life.  She was at her healthiest in 2018—she went to the gym daily, ate healthily, lost weight, gained muscle. She had so much energy until now. My entire family is in shock. Despite the weeks that have passed by, she STILL has not received any treatment for her cancer. It has been over a week since genetic testing was done to see if she had certain mutations that would allow for targeted therapy. We are STILL waiting for those results.She was sent home on February 1st on an oxygen tank. At 3 AM on February 3rd, she was gasping for air. We called for an ambulance. My dad went with her. At 5 AM, my dad called me to get to the hospital ASAP because he was scared she wasn't going to make it. She couldn't breathe. The ER doctor wanted to place her on an incubator. Once we arrived, the doctor finally put her on a BiPAP which significantly helped her with breathing. She was finally able to get a bed after 12 hours of being in the ER.The doctors wanted her to get an airway stent in her lungs. The hospital she is currently at does not provide this surgery. We have been waiting almost a week now for surrounding hospitals that can do the surgery to open up a bed for her. We thought she was getting better the last 2 days. Her breathing was slower and her voice was stronger. But last night, her breathing worsened. Her doctors now no longer want to do the surgery. I am frustrated because if the surgery was done earlier this week when she was better, we would not be having this issue. But now she is in serious, critical condition. She can't breathe.We have been told by others in the healthcare field to take her to UCSF to get proper and immediate care, instead of waiting weeks for something to be done. However, our insurance refuses to cover us if we do transfer her to UCSF. The purpose of this GoFundMe is to help pay for the treatments that my mom desperately needs. She is 51 years old. Just last Christmas she was talking about how she was excited to get presents for her future grandchildren. The doctors told her she had at least 1 year and at most 5 years to live. Yet every single day that we wait for her results to come back, beds to open up, and insurance to approve of her medications, her condition continues to worsen.If you cannot donate, please keep my mom in your thoughts and prayers.Thank you in advance,Reeva",36bfc7b2c187827d04a3f17e342f1296,50,0.0945,4.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Three weeks later, he was in an operating room for fifteen hours at St. Luke’s Hospital, as surgeons removed the malignant tumor, 1/3 of his tongue, and lymph nodes at the back of his mouth, and neck; followed by extensive reconstruction. After an extremely tough week in surgical ICU, he was able to go home, just in time for Christmas, to prepare for the next phase of recovery. With speech therapy and proactive measures planned – including radiation and chemotherapy - to prevent the cancer from returning, he knew he had a long road ahead of him. After weeks of healing, post-surgery, Josh endured another 9 weeks of outpatient treatment to kill the cancer cells in his body. There was joy all around when he rang the victory bell on his last day; as these were truly some of the hardest weeks of his life. As the Josh we all know and love, he kept his unwavering positive outlook on life; spending time with his family, friends, co-workers and guiding students to be the best version of themselves at the junior high school, where he works as an Assistant Principal. He regained his strength, and abilities that we may easily take for granted every day. After some time, Josh found his new normal. Life was good! Fast forward to January 2019: Josh met with his doctors for a routine post-Cancer checkup. Unfortunately, the results weren’t what we hoped for. The Squamous Cell Carcinoma is back, with a vengeance. Josh is now quickly preparing for a second surgery to remove the tumor on his lung. And, we are all ready to fight with him. However, he's still paying back the medical debt from the first round of care received during surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. So, this is where we PRAY HARD, and ASK FOR YOUR HELP. Josh’s surgery and post-op chemotherapy are going to be very expensive, over the next six months. We really, really, need your support.

He had had a cold for a long time and was very congested. His tonsils were swollen and red. We brought him to the doctor Wednesday morning. The did a strep test which came back negative. He had an ear infection in his right ear. The doctor suspected he had some sort of virus which can cause swelling of the lymph nodes. They did some blood work. His mono test came back negative. His white blood count was only slightly elevated at 16,000. Normal range is between 5,000 and 10,000. Since it was only slightly elevated they thought the ear infection explained the elevation. We were sent home with antibiotics and scheduled to come back for a follow up. The following Tuesday we brought him in for his follow up appointment where the doctor noticed a rash around his neck and on his lower abdomen, it looked like lots of tiny broken blood vessels. She voiced her concern about the rash and called the hospital. We were sent to the ER. After waiting for hours we were finally seen by a doctor who ordered blood work. His white count was 245,000. We were admitted to the pediatric ICU that night. He received lots of fluids through IV. The next morning he was brought to the OR for procedures under general anesthesia. He had a lumbar puncture to ensure there was no leukemia in his central nervous system and the fluid they took out was replaced was an equal dose of chemo. A PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) line was placed for easier long term access for treatment, this will later be replaced with a port in his chest, surgically placed. And he had a bone marrow biopsy where a needle was put into his hip bone to extract bone marrow and fluid from within the bone. The procedures went well and he handled anesthesia like a champ. The bone marrow sample confirmed that he has T cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. The plan for phase one is to receive steroids and chemotherapy for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4 weeks he will need another bone marrow biopsy to reevaluate the levels of leukemia in the bone marrow which will determine the steps for phase two. Right now the oncologist says we're looking at a 6 month process with hope of remission where leukemia levels are undetectable. Unfortunately this is a lifelong diagnosis that we will have to keep monitoring for the rest of his life.",53385296a5572443366c58a914dc8005,32,0.1402,4.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

She was diagnosed with breast cancer 7 years ago at the age of 40 years old. After doing many rounds of chemotherapy and radiation she had a double mastectomy to help reduce the chances of the cancer ever coming back. However, just over 2 years ago her mother passed away unexpectedly and tragically after having been ill herself for many years. In the midst of all this stress her worst fears had become reality again as the cancer returned even more aggressively and had metastasized to her major organs and bones. The impact of this news has been devastating to her family especially to her 2 young children who have known nothing in their short lives but knowing their dearest mom has cancer. They live in daily fear about her illness. She again began traditional chemotherapy and radiation in Canada but also to explore alternative cancer treatments in other countries as she was not getting any better. In January of 2018 she went to a world-renowned clinic in Mexico and spent 21 days there receiving treatments which started working well and she was feeling a lot better and stronger after that. Before going down to Mexico she could not even walk a few steps to the mailbox without feeling exhausted. After that initial treatment, she was walking briskly around the block. However this treatment requires constant trips to continue the healing and so she made an additional 3 trips there last year receiving treatments that are not offered in Canada. So not only has she been spending precious time away from her young family but they have spent tens of thousands of dollars doing everything they can to get Soula to beat this disease. Unfortunately, OHIP and medical aid do not cover any costs for these crucial treatments. She will now need to go back to a hospital in Mexico where she will need to stay for a month to receive innovative treatments for 6 hrs a day 7 days a week including a stem cell bone marrow transplant which is not offered as a treatment regimen in Canada for breast cancer. This will cost them another $55,000 CDN but as you can see they want to do everything they possibly can to keep their loving mother and wife alive and well for as long as they can.This disease has been a tremendous financial and emotional burden on this family and I reach out to all to help Soula get the necessary medical treatment to help her in her battle to defeat this dreadful disease.

https://www.gofundme.com/help-leandres-family-beat-cancer-together,Help Léandre's family beat cancer together,2019-02-07,2.0,2019.0,8083.0,40000.0,71.0,113.84507042253522,1711,"(Version française ci-après)My nephew-in-love Léandre was diagnosed with a brain tumour on December 27, 2018. Four days later, on New Year's Eve, he underwent 10 hours of surgery to remove it. Although the surgery was a success and nearly all of the mass was removed, the tumour was malignant, so the next steps for Léandre’s treatment are radiation therapy and chemotherapy.￼The past weeks have been devastating. We are all reeling from the shock of his quick diagnosis: his mom Anne, his dad Denis, his little brother Audrick, his Oma Rosemarie and Opa Andreas, grand-maman Germaine, uncles Georg and Benoit, aunt Catherine (my sister) and cousin David (my son). Though we are not related by blood, I've known Léandre his whole life, and love him as a nephew.Léandre is ten years old. He is an extremely gifted violinist, who has been playing since he was 3 1/2 and competing since he was 4. He has won two silver medals at the Canadian Music Competition and has performed twice at Carnegie Hall! Here is a link to hear him play at the CMC competition in 2017. And here is a link to his very first performance, at 4 years old.￼Léandre also swims, dives, rides horses and loves to read. He particularly enjoys books on ancient mythology; he raced right through all of Rick Riordan’ books, and read the Iliad and the Odyssey. He is bursting with life - kind, enthusiastic and passionate about everything he does.￼The Schwab-Gaucher household is filled with warmth. Birthday parties are marked by Anne's incredible homemade cakes, in the shape of planets, or sea creatures, and by elaborate treasure hunts and activities for the kids, animated by Anne and Denis and decorated by Oma's beautiful artwork. ￼Léandre and his brother Audrick, 7, are very close. Audrick looks up to his big brother, and plays the violin as well. When they are at Oma and Opa's house, they practice violin at the same time. Léandre plays for Catherine, and Opa accompanies Audrick on the piano. At home, Toxo the cat listens - of their four cats, he has the best musical ear.This past December, David and I went to Léandre's house to spend Christmas together with the family, as we do every year. Anne baked up a storm - I think she had 20 varieties of Christmas cookies this year. Léandre and Audrick had practiced some Christmas carols to play for the family, as duets on the violin. David had just started learning the flute, and had brought it with him. When Léandre learned this, he didn't skip a beat: he transposed his own harmony in his head, so David could play along in the key of C. It was one of those small but great moments that showed Léandre's generosity and irrepressibly positive energy. That was three days before his diagnosis. ￼It's hard to believe that was only five weeks ago. Though Léandre had been having some mild headaches and nausea for a few months, he was otherwise in perfect health. Today, he is struggling to talk, and his walking is unsteady as he recovers from the effects of the surgery. Every day is better, but there is a long road ahead.￼Léandre's tumour was a medulloblastoma. Despite its near-total removal, six weeks of radiation therapy will be needed to target the remaining cancerous cells and keep the tumour from growing back. Since the treatment he needs (proton therapy) is not available in Canada, the Montreal Children's Hospital has helped arrange for the family to go to the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where they have the specialized equipment and expertise required. After that, Léandre will go through four to six months of chemotherapy administered at the Children’s Hospital in Montreal. He may also need other therapies, due to the strong side effects of the cancer treatments.In order to be at Léandre's side during his battle, and to take care of little brother Audrick, his dad Denis has stopped working, and will not be able to return to work for the better part of this year. There is a government relief program for caregivers, but this will only cover about half of his salary, which they depend on. Without more help, their family will be in serious financial difficulty.￼That's why this GoFundMe campaign was created. All the money raised will go straight to Léandre's family, to cover their loss of income and inevitable extra expenses, so they can focus their energy on what matters: Léandre’s treatment and rehabilitation. They will be deeply grateful for any contributions. ￼With love, luck and support, Léandre will be back on his violin playing concertos well before next Christmas! Love,Aunt-in-love Jenny Aidez la famille de Léandre à combattre le cancer ensemble Mon neveu Léandre a été diagnostiqué d’une tumeur cérébrale le 27 décembre 2018. Quelques jours plus tard, la veille du jour de l'an, il a subi 10 heures de chirurgie pour qu’on la lui enlève. Bien que la chirurgie fût un succès et que presque toute la tumeur ait été enlevée, elle s'est avérée cancéreuse. Les prochaines étapes pour Léandre sont donc la radiothérapie et la chimiothérapie.￼Les dernières semaines ont été dévastatrices. Nous sommes tous sous le choc de son diagnostic : Anne, la mère de Léandre, son père Denis, son petit frère Audrick, sa Oma Rosemarie, son Opa Andreas, sa grand-maman Germaine, ses oncles Georg et Benoit, sa tante Catherine (ma sœur) et son cousin David (mon fils). Bien que Léandre et moi ne sommes pas liés par le sang, nous sommes liés par l'amour : Léandre est comme un neveu pour moi.Léandre a dix ans. Il est un violoniste extrêmement doué : il joue depuis l'âge de 3 ans et demi, et fait des compétitions de musique depuis qu'il a 4 ans. Il a gagné deux médailles d'argent au Concours de musique du Canada. Il a même joué deux fois à Carnegie Hall à New York!Voici un lien où vous pouvez écouter une de ses compétitions en 2017. Et voici un lien vers sa première performance, à 4 ans. Il fait de la natation, du plongeon et de l'équitation, et il adore lire. Il aime particulièrement les livres sur la mythologie antique, et il a lu l'œuvre complète de Rick Riordan, ainsi que l'Iliade et l'Odyssée. Il est aimable, enthousiaste et passionné dans tout ce qu'il entreprend.￼La résidence Schwab-Gaucher est bien chaleureuse. À chaque fête d'enfant, Anne fait des gâteaux personnalisés incroyables, en forme des planètes ou de créatures marines. Il y a des chasses au trésor élaborées et d'autres activités divertissantes pour les enfants, animées par Anne et Denis et décorées par les œuvres d'art magnifiques d'Oma.￼Léandre et son petit frère Audrick, 7 ans, sont très proches. Audrick admire beaucoup son frère ainé, et joue également le violon. Quand ils sont chez Oma et Opa, ils pratiquent le violon en même temps. Léandre joue pour Catherine, et Opa accompagne Audrick au piano. Chez eux, Toxo le chat écoute en ronronnant – de leurs quatre chats, c’est lui qui a l'oreille la plus musicale.En décembre, David et moi sommes allés chez Léandre pour fêter Noël avec la famille, comme on le fait à chaque année. Comme d'habitude, Anne s’est surpassée dans la cuisine; je crois qu'elle a préparé 20 variétés de biscuits de Noël cette année. Léandre et Audrick avaient préparé des chansons de Noël au violon. David venait de commencer à apprendre la flûte traversière, et l'avait emmenée avec lui. Quand Léandre l'a su, il n'a pas hésité : il a transposé l'harmonie qu'il avait appris, dans sa tête, pour que David puisse jouer avec eux. C'était un petit moment, mais qui démontrait la générosité de Léandre et son énergie positive. C'était trois jours avant qu'on apprenne son diagnostic.￼Il est difficile de croire que cela fait seulement cinq semaines. Bien que Léandre avait parfois des maux de tête légers ou un peu de nausée ces derniers mois, il était autrement en parfaite santé. Aujourd'hui, il a encore de la difficulté à parler, et sa démarche est incertaine, dû aux effets de la chirurgie. Il s’améliore à chaque jour, mais il y a encore un long chemin à parcourir.￼La tumeur de Léandre était un médulloblastome. Bien qu'on l'ait presque complètement enlevée, Léandre devra subir six semaines de radiothérapie pour détruire les cellules cancéreuses restantes et pour empêcher la tumeur de revenir. Comme le traitement requis (la protonthérapie) n'est pas disponible au Canada, l'Hôpital de Montréal pour enfants a arrangé pour que Léandre puisse le suivre à l'Hôpital général du Massachusetts, à Boston, où ils ont les appareils et l'expertise requis. Léandre subira ensuite quatre à six mois de chimiothérapie, administrée par l'Hôpital de Montréal pour enfants. Il aura aussi probablement besoin d'autres thérapies, dû aux effets secondaires puissants des traitements contre le cancer. Afin de rester aux côtés de Léandre pendant sa lutte, et afin de prendre soin de son petit frère Audrick, son père Denis a dû arrêter de travailler, et devra arrêter le travail pour la majeure partie de l’année. Bien qu'il y ait un crédit d'impôt du gouvernement pour les aidants familiaux, celui-ci ne couvrira que la moitié de son salaire, qui est la principale source de revenu de sa famille. Sans aide supplémentaire, ils seront en grande difficulté financière.￼Voilà pourquoi cette campagne GoFundMe a été créée.

She is now 11 years old ♥️..... I introduce Josie to you all. ￼She has such a passion for life! She brings so much light and love to her community, the environment, friends, sporting teams, dance teams and family. Her love for life goes beyond herself and extends to so many others both human and animal. She truly is an inspiration and at such a young age!￼￼￼￼￼Today I found out Josie has bone cancer in her lower leg. This news was truly heart breaking. Josie loves being active and enjoys dance, netball, swimming, camping, practicing gymnastics with friends, going skating and so, so much more. Whilst everyone around her was devastated with today’s news, Josie’s one concern was that her mum was alright ♥️.Josie’s mum (Nic) is one of my dearest friends (adopted family over here in OZ and amazing god parent to my twins). Nic is a single mother of three fabulous children (Ben, Josie and Charlotte) who have all learned how to be beautiful inside and out from her. Nicole is a high school teacher and for as long as I have known her has always given 150% to her children and students. It’s so hard bringing up children on one wage and Nic is no stranger to making huge sacrifices for her children. This news has shattered Nic, Josie, Ben and Charlotte’s sense of life’s predictability and safety. Whilst surgery and treatment in hospital is covered, Nic and her family will have a tough journey ahead of them. This truly beautiful family will need financial support just to keep life going and to pay for Josie and the rest of the children’s support needs in months that follow. I ask you to dig deep and pledge as much as you can to support this gorgeous family manage bills, transport costs, therapy costs etc over the next several months. Nic and her family live within the constraints of a very tight (sometimes too tight) budget. They need our support. I could not think of a more deserving family.￼Josie will have to learn to adapt to a new way of living. The type of surgery will be invasive and will have significant impact on her ability to do what she loves at best and may result in some more significant surgery / impact on her mobility depending on what we find out next week - fingers crossed this is not the case.I will keep you posted as to how she is doing.A truly beautiful young lady inside and out♥️.￼Life long friends ♥️.

It has just been announced that Madison is battling a rare, life-threatening brain cancer, called a High Grade Neuroepithelial Tumor.


It all started in February, when Madison was in and out of the doctors office because she was not feeling well, had a loss of appetite, and sleeping so much that it just did not seem right. Like many of us this winter, we had our children to the doctor for sicknesses that have been going around; but for little Madison, it turned out it wasn't what she was dealing with.On Thursday, March 1st, Debbie and John Williams were informed that Madison needed a CT scan. This CT scan revealed what no parent wanted to hear. . . . that their little girl had a brain tumor.  Upon the news, they were immediately transferred to the Childrens Hospital in Chapel Hill, NC.  Debbie and John were told that Madison needed to undergo brain surgery to remove this tumor and gather tissue. Tissue results would reveal if the tumor was cancerous or not.On Saturday, March 3rd, Madison spent the majority of the day in surgery. Her parents Debbie and John anxiously awaited for their little girl to awake. It was a joyous moment when the surgeon notified them that the tumor looked to be completely removed and Madison did an amazing job. Unfortunately an MRI later that night revealed that there may be remnants of the tumor still there that they could not see....     While in recovery, Madison had her appetite back and she only wanted to eat pink donuts. She was quickly nicknamed by hospital staff as the donut girl! Two days later Madison was on her way home, snacking on salami and pink donuts, and excelling at recovery from brain surgery. Within those couple of weeks after, she was back to her old self enjoying time with her brother Andrew, grandparents, family and many fun play-dates with friends.


On March 20th, the results came back and revealed disheartening news. That Madison has a rare cancer called a High Grade Neuroepithelial Tumor and her surgeons are diligently reaching out all over the country to find clinical trials and the best treatment plan to battle this. While waiting, she starts daily aggressive chemotherapy on March 26th.Debbie and John are determined to do whatever it takes to save Madison's life and be with her to help her get through these aggressive chemotherapy treatments. Travel will be abundant and expensive. Medical bills are already starting to come in at astronomical amounts.  We have started this fundraising campaign to help the Williams family cover the traveling and medical expenses of Madisons treatments. Let's help sweet Madison get through this!!! A donation of any kind would be amazing, along with your prayers and words of encouragement. Together we can take some of the burden off their shoulders.

A few days later she traveled to Yale New Haven Hospital to have surgery to remove the tumor. Recovery from the surgery alone would be a long road, but her treatment was just getting started.She began radiation treatment in December followed by 12 cycles of chemotherapy and physical therapy. After many months, she started to show signs of improvement.Unfortunately this was short lived and her condition began to decline in late 2018, prompting her doctors to start running new tests. They discovered several masses in her brain near the area where they removed her tumor in 2017, diagnosing them as potential remnants of the cancer, scar tissue or radiation-damaged tissue. She is scheduled for surgery this Wednesday to have the tissue removed, and we are hopeful this will help improve her condition.The treatments, procedures and medicines Nancy relies on to help her battle cancer are very expensive. She has been unable to work during her treatment and her family has had to adapt to life on a single income. Fighting through cancer is tough enough, but the added financial burden they face makes a bad situation worse.We Need Your Help!There is something that we can do for Nancy and Kelly that could have a major impact - raise some money to help offset these bills!

Thank you SO much for taking a few minutes to read our mission, and view our videos. We appreciate it very much. On November 3rd, 2015, our world was rocked to its core. Amy Vogt, a 54 year old Mother, Grandmother, Daughter, Sister, Aunt, Cousin, and Friend, was diagnosed with Stage IV Leiomyosarcoma. Amy was told by a team of Oncologists, that she had only 6-8 weeks to live. Sarcomas are a rare, and aggressive, form of cancer. The 5 year survival rate for Stage IV Leiomyosarcoma is “Unavailable/nonexistent” according to the American Cancer Society. With a 0% chance of being alive in 5 years, and a team of oncologists suggesting that treatment should not be pursued because “chemo would make her last few weeks unbearable”. We threw caution to the wind, and decided that Amy will Be The 1%!!!!!! Amy WILL be a statistic that MATTERS!!! We sought out a second opinion, and with the positive outlook that our secondary oncologist had, Amy has endured 8 different chemotherapies over the last 3 years, with one of those being a clinical trial. Through all of these treatments, Amy has continued to work, spend time with her family, and without a break in chemo over the last 3 years, the tumors continued to mutate and grow. On January 17th, 2019, we were given a very grim outlook. The options that we could choose between were 1) “Admit yourself into the Hospital, for a minimum of a week, and a mustard gas derivative will be administered into your port, everyday, for 5 days in a row. IF you survive the week, you can go home for a week, and then return the following week to repeat the treatment.” Well, that sounds terrible, what is the other option? 2) “Hospice”. Amy is 57 years old, her parents are alive, her siblings are alive, she has children and grandchildren that love her unconditionally, Amy said “These are not options, these are death sentences.”Now that you have had a moment to digest the whirlwind of events that have occurred over last three years, we found Envita!!!!! (Their link is included in the videos). Envita can not only help Amy, but they can FIX AMY!!!!!!! Envita, is an Integrated Cancer Treatment Facility, located in Scottsdale, AZ. Envita was created by Oncologists, to offer hope to patients, when standard treatment therapies have failed them. Amy has already completed the preliminary tests while at Envita last week. Treatment is tentatively scheduled to start on February 18th. And now for the tough part, Envita is a stand alone facility, and insurance doesn’t cover one single penny. Everything must be paid out of pocket. It is very difficult for us to ask for help. That is not the type of people we are, however, when your back is up against a wall, and you need to decide between Try or Die, you Try!! From all of us at Team Amy, we Thank You for taking the time to read our story. Also, we invite you to send words of encouragement to Amy as she embarks on a journey that we hope and pray has a positive outcome. Lastly, if you find it feasible, we are so very humbled to receive your donation.

Some of you may know her as Reese. But her name is Arica. Her journey has been a long , troublesome and painful one to say the least. On the second week of  November my mom went to the Er with horrible back pain. After many tests it was revealed my mother had cancer. She has been diagnosed with  stage 4 metastatic non small cell lung cancer. It is currently in her lungs, spine, hips, pelvis and ribs. Her Journey--After they found the cancer she was then hospitalized and they began trying to figure out what they should do and where it all was at. They would come to find out she had 2 tumors in her lungs and several on her spine. . A surgery was later done to remove a 3mm lesion and reconstruct her spine. More tests would be done and after a short while they would find out it was also in her hips and pelvis . So they began radiation.  10 treatments to be exact. She was still in pain and was now having difficulty moving her leg with out extreme pain. And could not walk with out a Walker.   On January 9th I drove from ohio to Illinois to be with my mom for 5 days. In those 5 days I watched her agonizing in pain and stressing about Bill's and such.  I ended up finding her a wheelie walker(not sure what it's really called lol) from a nice lady on FB. It helped her tremendously but she needed a wheelchair. Her friend got her one the day after i came back to Ohio♡♡ . Before I left a new sudden pain had arrived she got scheduled to get it checked and they found the cancer has now also spread to her ribs. She has been in and out of the hospital from testing to hospitalizations since then from the intensity of the pain and treatments. She had her first chemo treatment on January 22♡♡♡♡♡On friday January 25th I got a call she went in for pain in her stomach by ambulance.  That turned out to be a blockage in her colon. Her breathing was shallow and o2 was low so they ran tests and found she had 2 blood clots in her lungs and fluid on her lungs as well. So she was admitted again. She was released on 27th to go home but that was short because of instense pain she was readmitted. I made the journey once again on Feb 1st to my mom. She is still currently in the hospital. They have found out thr cancer is through out her pelvis and hip. So she's having radiation treatments again. They are now telling us my mom can not walk on her leg at all its non weight bearing and she has to have someone at home with her at all times. They are placing her in a skilled care facility this week to help her get back and forth from thr hospital for her radiation which is breaking her heart . She doesn't want to be in a facility. We have looked into home health options however it is not covered under my mother's insurance and sadly not affordable . Its roughly 20 a hour at 8 hours a day 5 to 7 days a week depending when my step father works. My mother does have insurance however since she is no longer working all of these finances are falling to my step father . Between the deductables and co pay and monthly fee to keep her insurance she needs help and now for the home health.

Sweet Colette was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called RMS. While this is a very serious diagnosis, the good news is the cancer cells are embryonic and the CT scan shows it hasn’t spread. Treatment is starting immediately and is anticipated to take six to twelve months. To comply with the safety protocols of treatment, Collette is being taken out of school, and Kristen and Seth will each be taking turns being home with her and relying on family to fill in to care give as well. The road to healing will be long and taxing on Colette, Benjamin, Kristen and Seth. If we could rally around them and provide any extra support for healing and some normalcy in an especially stressful and scary time, that would mean so much. The goal is to provide donations to help offset missed paychecks and pay medical bills. In Kristen’s words “I can't believe this is happening. I can't believe I've said ""Colette has cancer"" out loud. I'm supposed to read a similar story online, donate to a go fund me, keep the family in my prayers, and hug my kids tighter when I tucked them in that night. However, this is our new reality…please start praying for this little fire cracker girl. She is an amazing girl and is going to do amazing things in life. There is a bump in her road right now. Thank you so much to family and friends who already know. Your support has been everything. Those aren't hollow words- they have been everything we've needed to survive the past weeks.” Thank you on behalf of the House family for any donations you are able to make.

We may have family or friends who have been diagnosed with it, or have even personally battled this disease. The evil indifference of cancer means it does not care if you’ve been a good person. It does not care if you are a father, a mother or a child. It does not allow you to dictate when it strikes or how aggressive it will be. Cancer is utterly callous towards life itself. The reasons why some people are forced in to this battle they never chose is oftentimes unexplainable. In our own attempts to understand why this is happening to another we imagine ourselves in their place. We know that any day could be our day and the cruelty of cancer could force us in to this same battle. In a certain way our shared vulnerability to cancer unites us. Cancer is our common enemy and we battle it together. For those who know Sam Storkson it is difficult to think of a time he hasn’t been smiling. His positivity and friendliness are immediately apparent even if you’ve only met him once for a short time. If you’ve seen him with his 3 children, Sonny, Scout and Selah, you’re amazed at how supportive, loving and fun a father he is. Sam’s children are his world and he is theirs. Sam’s rock and center of his universe is his wife Nikki. Their mutual love, adoration and support for each other is inspiring. In February of 2018 Sam was given the life-changing diagnosis of Aggressive Metastatic Papillary Thyroid Cancer. Sam’s had his first surgery, a bilateral neck dissection and a total thyroidectomy (thyroid removal) March 5th. Radioactive iodine therapy followed in May 2018. Side-effects of radioactive iodine and thyroid surgery left Sam with bilateral vocal cord paralysis and difficulty breathing. He subsequently had 2 more surgeries on his vocal fold to help his breathing, but they were not as successful as hoped. In December 2018 an ultrasound showed a new suspicious lymph node, the biopsy came back as cancer and he was referred back to Mayo. Sam’s doctors placed a tracheostomy tube in his airway to alleviate his breathing on January 22, Sam is currently recovering from that operation. Sam will need another surgery in the future to remove the cancer and additional tests will be performed to make sure the cancer has not spread. Despite all of this, Sam is hoping to return to work as soon as possible. If you have seen Sam lately you have noticed his difficulties to speak. Despite his paralyzed vocal cords and trouble breathing this amazing man still makes sure to say hi and ask how YOU are doing; and there is ALWAYS a smile on his face. Over the past year Sam has had to be out of work multiple times for doctor’s appointments, treatments and surgeries. The financial strain a major illness causes can be overwhelming, in addition to the physical and emotional strains. The stress of finances can take away from what Sam should really be focusing on, himself and his family. Sam will not battle this alone. His wife and children will not battle this alone. We will battle with them. Please donate what you can. Every dollar raised means less time Sam and his family have to worry about bills and more time just being a family.

But 4 months after Yvonne passed, Rick himself was diagnosed with an active form of prostate cancer.   A few weeks ago, his situation seemed hopeless.  By the end of 2018 his symptoms worsened and the pain is at times unbearable.  Diagnosis: The cancer is spreading. There is no cure.  The best option is to get on harmful chemicals for the rest of his life to manage the symptoms.  Two previous treatments including high dose radiation barely slowed it down, and continuing down this road would actually allow the cancer to progress to a point where it is completely drug resistant.Then, what we believe was God’s providence presented the chance for an actual cure: a world class program in Florida with the purpose of curing him.  This 9-week program uses specialized imaging scans, laser radiation treatment, and cryogenic surgery to actually kill the cancer at its source...and has a 95% success rate!Feel free to read about the program, doctors, and testimonies here: Dattoli Cancer Center  The exciting part: Dad's 5 grandchildren aged 1-9 who are crazy about their Grandpa get to have him around a lot longer and at full health.  The challenging part: virtually all of this is outside his insurance network and needs to be paid out of pocket.Many people who know Rick's heart, understanding the life and death urgency we face, are already stepping up to assist with aspects of the trip such as transportation, lodging, and food.  But the total cost of this life-altering treatment itself will exceed $25,000.   A good family friend summed it up by saying ""nobody should die because the cure is outside their insurance network.""  We passionately want to see Dad be able to continue his legacy of touching so many lives without having to struggle because of the the sizable cost (he's already insisting on working remotely whenever able throughout this 9-week process...because, well, that's who Rick is).  And that’s what this GoFundMe campaign is all about. We are asking you to join us in helping this man who has helped so many without ever asking for anything in return.  I can't imagine my life, or those of my wife and kids without him.  The timing on starting this treatment is ASAP.   Please seriously consider searching your heart, asking your God, and taking any action possible.  Whatever you feel led to donate WILL make a difference, and WILL be gratefully appreciated.    Sharing on social media is hugely important too.  Every dollar brings us one step closer to saving the life of our Dad and Grampa we love so much.  If you are in a position to give a sizable donation it is greatly appreciated and will be put towards this immediately.  If you can only give $10 but will share this campaign 5 or 10 or 50 times...it  helps!Thank you for your generosity.",df8df4eab573c1bb850ab053cdfdfa55,31,0.505,11.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer in children and adolescents. The tumor often originates in the long bones of the body, and while osteosarcoma frequently starts in a particular bone, it can potentially move to other sites in the body, such as the lungs and other bones.

On May 21st 2018, I took Zhyria to see her primary pediatrician for pain in her knee. The pediatrician checked her and sent her for an x-ray. Afterwards she was taken back to school to finish the day. A couple of hours later the pediatrician called me back to her office to go over the x-ray results. She told me that, “It looks like cancer”, and Zhyria needed to go see the specialist in Atlanta. After the school day had ended, I took Zhyria back to the doctor’s office to hear the results of her x-ray. I wish I could describe in words how I felt, the moment that I heard the results or even the moment that I witness Zhyria get the news, but I can’t. All that I  can say is it was not a good feeling.

￼
￼￼
Zhyria missed the last week of school, and was off to start what is now her fight against childhood cancer.  On May 22nd 2018, she was admitted to the Children’s Hospital Of Atlanta -Scottish Rite,  where she received her first MRI. On Friday May 25th 2018, she had a biopsy and the doctor told me she had osteosarcoma. On May 31st 2018, she had a CT scan and PET scan. On June 1st 2018, her oncologist told me that the cancer had spread to her lungs, and near her spine. On June 8th 2018 she started her first chemo treatment. On Saturday June 23rd 2018, she noticed that her hair was starting to come out. Now she’s facing possible amputation of her right leg because the tumors have gotten bigger.

￼
At a time that should be carefree, when she should be focused on starting 7th grade, bff’s, and etc. She must now learn to accept hospitals, nurses and doctors as her new reality.  Zhyria turned 12 years old on July 19th 2018. I never thought we'd celebrate her 12th birthday in the hospital but God is still good. I thank Him for the 12 years that He has blessed me with her. We had another celebration several days later at her favorite Mexican restaurant.

￼￼
We live about 4 hours away from the Children’s Hospital of Atlanta. We will continue to commute back and forth for treatment.  In an attempt to keep some sense of normalcy, we have decided not to relocate to Atlanta. Zhyria loves her school and being with her friends. She loves attending church, volunteering, family time, making jokes and playing pranks, eating/ trying new foods, and dogs. She’s one of the sweets little girls you’ll ever meet, she has a compassionate heart. She wants to be a mental health counselor when she grows up.  She’s very resilient and has a strong-will, even when she is tired she continues to fight. 

￼
￼
I am a single mother, sole provider for Zhryia and her 15 year old sister Za’Miriya. When we found out that Zhyria was sick, I had to take leave from work to care for her. I have used all of my paid leave time and am currently on leave without pay. We are fortunate to have support from family, friends, co-workers, church members, etc. Needless to say we have only just begun this journey on Zhyria’s fight again cancer. We need your support! We are thankful for all of the positive thoughts and encouragement, well wishes, phone calls, visits, etc. We are asking for any amount of donation that you can contribute.

On Tuesday, January 15th, the neurosurgeons at the Stollery Children’s Hospital removed 100% of the tumour.  But on Thursday February 7th, after the biopsy and pathology report came back, we found out she has been diagnosed with Medulloblastoma sub-group 3, a highly aggressive and malignant form of childhood brain cancer. Because of her age and cancer type, her doctors are saying that her best possible chance for a cure is to undergo 6-9 weeks of an advanced form of radiation therapy at the University of Florida's Proton Therapy Institute, before continuing with chemotherapy at home in Canada. This therapy will target the cancer cells directly while causing the least amount of damage to her developing brain and young body.The family will likely be able to secure funding for the treatment itself, as well as for Aven and one companion to fly over. Her mother Jacqueline is planning to travel with her, leaving behind Aven's dad, Aaron, and their four other children: Gigi, Lily (Aven's twin sister), Jimmy, and Ammon, who is not yet 3. All expenses aside from the treatment and flights over will be up to them to provide up front and they are considering all options available to them, including applying to charities to potentially get some costs reimbursed. All this comes after a prolonged period of financial hardship for Aven's family. The social worker assisting Aven's family has recommended that they open an account to help cover incidentals for an entire year of treatment, and this will be an ongoing challenge for them.Anything you could contribute here would help Aven's family manage the cost of any medication and treatments not covered by the insurance or government subsidy, (such as physiotherapy). Funds raised will also be used for such things as transportation, accommodations, and food for Aven and Jaqueline while they are out of the country, and expenses for the family if Aaron has to miss more work.Our sweet Aven has overcome a lot so far and her recovery after brain surgery is considered miraculous. But she still has a long way to go. Throughout it all, she has remained one of the kindest, most generous and loving little girls I know.

The cancer had also spread to his lungs. After successfully removing his infected kidney and tumor, Nate quickly faced another hurdle as he developed a C Diff infection shortly after the surgery. He endured surgery to remove the infection and consequently had to have 90% of his colon removed. Still, he continued to be determined to win his fight against cancer. During the past several months he has fought valiantly in hopes of defeating this terrible disease, with his wife, children, family, and friends as his driving motivation. Sadly, Nate passed away Tuesday morning (Feb 5th) surrounded by family and close friends. At the time of his diagnosis, Nate had just embarked on fullfilling a lifelong dream of starting his own business. During this transition he was able to obtain medical insurance, but unfortunately that will not be enough to cover all of the related expenses. At this time we are trying to raise $25,000 that will go directly to his wife Alicia and their family to assist with these many immediate expenses. Anything above this amount will obviously be given to them to cover future expenses which will quickly be coming in. Nate is an amazing individual who has touched many lives. He continually provided service to others and gave everything he could to those less fortunate than himself. Our hope is to try and continue the generosity that we have learned from Nate these many wonderful years of knowing him. His positive outlook on life is infectious, and his influence will last a lifetime.Please read about Nate's inspirational story on his blog listed below.

She underwent a lumpectomy, 6 cycles of chemo and 30 rounds of radiation. She did well until May 2016 when she got the bad news once again. So she received 6 more rounds of chemo followed by a bilateral mastectomy in Sept 2016. A PET scan was performed and the results came back negative for cancer, so no further treatments were needed at that point. She thought she had finally battled and beat cancer! Unfortunately in August 2017 she was given the bad news once again after a routine follow up appointment. She went onto 6 more months of chemo, more surgery and another 28 rounds of radiation.  A chest CT was performed and results showed no more signs of cancer.  Kerry beat it for a third time! On July 26, 2018 after a another routine CT chest scan & chest ultrasound she was diagnosed a 4th time. The left side came back positive for Metastatic ductal carcinoma.  TREATMENT:Even with being diagnosed four times, she is still positive and determined more than ever to BEAT this disease that has afflicted her for so long for the sake of loving life and her family more than ever.  GIVING UP IS NOT AN OPTION! Her treatment options at this time are as follows:  1)  her Canadian doctors are getting a second opinion from Toronto specialists to evaluate if surgery is an option at this point and to radiate, but fears it may not be promising given her history and pour results of all previous treatments.  A referral has also been sent to Princess Margaret in Toronto, Ontario to exhaust all possible treatments in Canada. 2)  Kerry has been exploring alternative cancer treatments not currently available in Canada, and has reached out to cancer clinics in Germany. These clinics offer specialized treatments such as regional chemotherapy (RCT). RCT has had good response rates for people in Kerry’s situation. However, pursuing this treatment is costly - approximately $200,000. She has a lot to think about and is considering all of the suggestions from her Canadian doctors, German hospitals and cancer clinics which offer the world's most advanced treatments.  Time is of the essence since it has already been 4 weeks since she has been diagnosed for the 4th time and no treatment plan has been set forth yet.  Regardless of where she decides to follow up with treatments, there are financial strains such as travelling and accommodations that will be incurred.There is HOPE!Several Canadians have explored the alternative cancer treatments and have had positive results.  Kerry has been in contact with a local survivor - a young woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer that had metastasized - that was in much of the same situation as she is currently in . This Canadian girl was told that she only had a few months to live. She decided to take fate into her own hands and went to Germany for RCT.  Her recent PET scan shows that there are no further signs of cancer.  And Sudbury also has a Chelmsford man attending the Germany clinic in September 2018 with positive anticipation of good news.  Please help Kerry finally beat this disease and get back to being a great mother, wife, sister, aunt, daughter and my best friend.  She needs your help to lessen the financial burdens that his awful disease has put on her and her family.   Please donate since time of the essence.Donate today!God bless you for all of your best wishes, prayers and generosity!",6fb8d93451d52815e64f7f2498668ba0,38,0.703215,150.0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

On September 21, 2018, the lives of the Thompson family were forever changed when they took their 13-year-old daughter, Zion, for a routine volleyball physical.

After waiting three excruciating hours in the ER, Zion finally got a scan at 11 PM. Zion and her family then waited about two more heart-wrenching hours for the results. When the entire family was escorted into a private, dimly lit room with small couches--they immediately knew this sterile room would be forever engrained in their memories. That's when the doctor came in and gave them the blur of the news that their 13-year-old daughter has CANCER! Just in the peak of her teen years when all is suppose to be new and bright, Zion was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma.

I am now trying to pay out of pocket in order to finish up my last year, and not being able to work has really taken a toll on that.

After a six-hour surgery and a round of radiation, followed two years later by another tumor, long surgery and round of chemo … we thought Kelly had beat the odds.She was cancer free for 38 years. On September 25, 2018, Kelly experienced a seizure followed by many more in the ensuing months. What was first thought as a stroke was later confirmed as another brain tumor. For those who do not know Kelly, she may well be the sweetest, kindest and most gentle soul you could ever meet. She is a friend to all furry creatures and loves adventure, traveling, hiking and biking.  Kelly is an extremely compassionate person with a heart of gold — and beloved aunt to her nieces and nephew. Parts of her life have not been easy or fair, but despite her ongoing fight with cancer, she remains optimistic and ready to put on her boxing gloves to show cancer who is boss. The operation to remove her latest brain tumor was on January 22, 2019.  The resulting biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) — an incredibly aggressive and fast-growing form of cancer.  Kelly has a long, tough road ahead.  As a result of the surgery, she has lost most movement in her right arm and right leg. She is currently undergoing physical therapy at an in-patient rehabilitation center for the next few weeks to regain her strength and let her brain heal. She will most likely require significant rounds of chemotherapy, radiation, and outpatient physical therapy.  Her recovery is very much a work in progress.We are establishing this fund to help assist Kelly with her out-of-pocket medical and living expenses.  She is currently unable to work and because of her pre-existing condition, insurance has always been — and will continue to be — an uphill battle.

He will undergo surgery this Thursday, Jan 17th for an estimated six-hours.  From there, they will do genomic testing on the removed tumor to determine what type of therapy will be needed to fight this aggressive cancer.

Billie =========================== Hello!  Being diagnosed with a serious illness like cancer is devastating, not only for the individual, but family, friends and loved ones feel the pain.  Like any life changing illness, cancer affects everything in your life and adding an overwhelming financial burden to an already stressed situation makes things even worse.  Bottom-line, it is truly sad how something as material as money can stop someone from getting the life-saving help they so desperately need.  Unfortunately, this is the situation Nick’s family is currently facing.  Days before Christmas, Nick was diagnosed with a rare high grade sarcoma cancer.  At this point, details of exactly what is happening to his body are uncertain; however, we do know that a trip to MD Anderson in Houston, Texas is urgent followed by necessary surgery and cancer treatments.    As many of you know, the Hancocks are very close and like with everything, they are tackling this battle together.  They are willing to sacrifice whatever it takes including financial hardship to save their son’s life.  After much research, Nick’s mom, Gina found MD Anderson to be one of the best clinics in the country to treat this rare cancer and knows this may be the only way to help their son.  Surgeons at MD Anderson are amongst the most skilled in the world, using the latest techniques to conquer this rare cancer.  Like all surgeries, sarcoma surgery is most successful when performed by a specialist with a great deal of experience in this particular procedure.  As a family friend, I am asking for a little help… I know there are millions of people in the world currently dealing with cancer and other serious illnesses so I hate to even ask, but it would be very helpful and much appreciated if you can find just a little extra to donate to Nick’s family. Anything helps including prayers.  Thanks in advance! As we are notified of Nick’s status, updates will be posted for all to view.    Thanks again.",cbbaaf9fee0b4af12ebefbf3f0a8f3f2,31,0.394,30.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

He lives in Venezuela with his wife and 4 children. René has been a cattleman all of his life. It's hard to imagine René wearing something different than his cowboy gear, his handsome hat and his boots.  His family owned land in his home country, and he had a special connection with nature since a very young age. Over the last 20 years, Venezuela  has gone through one of the greatest crisis in its history which has slowly worsened with time.  Private lands have been invaded with the approval of a corrupt government, property prices have plummeted due to currency's devaluation product of its volatility, prices of food and other goods have risen exponentially with hyperinflation levels in the hundred-thousand %.  Hospitals have not escaped this crisis either. These things, and many other unfortunate situations, have driven millions of people to leave the country.  Despite all this, René stayed in his home country all these years, tending his land, staying connected with what he loves the most after his family, his animals and nature.In the last few years, René discovered a new passion, conservationism.  He found many species of birds and different animals that inhabited the lands he walked on, and dreamed of creating a sanctuary for all of these beautiful animals to live in without fear of being killed.  He would get the most amazing pictures from his trips into these beautiful lands.  One of them, a python wrapped around a deer as it was trying to swallow it, was published in a monthly publication in the US.  Like this picture, I remember seeing the picture of a bright red bird perched on a fence wire in these tropical lands.  Just beautiful.When we heard the news of René's illness we knew it was going to be a hard battle, but he has been blessed with the love of his family and good friends who are helping him during this phase in his life.  In an effort to seek treatments that would heal him, René came to the US in early 2019. René is currently at the Baptist Hospital in Miami, Florida, and has been offered a treatment that could treat his disease.  This treatment has already started as time is of the essence. Payment will be provided as soon as we can complete the funds. The cost is just under $70,000, aside from all diagnostics exams, etc.  He recently got done with his first round of chemotherapy.  He was scared, but seemed to  come out of it with very little side effects. An answer to prayer.  These treatments are costly and our prayer is that we're able to complete the funds necessary to pay for them soon. We're reaching out to the world to ask for help to cover these expenses.  If you feel led to contribute, we will be forever grateful.  If all you can do is pray for René, that is also a huge gift. We need all the prayer we can get.  Pray for peace and strength for René as he goes through this process, for his family to remain strong, and for wisdom for the medical personnel treating him.  Thank you for your consideration and for reading René's story.The Finol family.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Español]Queridos familiares y amigos,En Agosto de 2018 recibimos la noticia de que nuestro querido René había sido diagnosticado con cáncer pancreático.  En ese momento comenzó la batalla para tratar de salvar su vida.René tiene una hermosa familia. Él vive en Venezuela con su esposa y sus 4 hijos. René ha sido ganadero toda su vida. Es difícil visualizar a René con otra indumentaria que no sea la de un vaquero, su elegantesombrero y sus botas. Su familia tenía tierras en su país natal y él tuvo siempre una conexión especial con la naturaleza desde una edad temprana. Durante los últimos 20 años Venezuela ha atravesado por una de las peores crisis en su historia, la cual ha emperorado con el tiempo. Tierras privadas han sido invadidas con la aprobación de un gobierno corrupto, los precios de las propiedades se han derrumbado debido a la devaluación de la moneda producto de su volatilidad, los precios de la comida y otros bienes ha aumentado exponencialmente con una hiperinflación de cientos de miles %. Los hospitales no han escapado esta crisis tampoco.  Éstas y otras situaciones desafortunadas han impulsado a millones de personas a irse del país. A pesar de todo esto, René se ha quedado en el país durante todos estos años cuidando sus tierras y manteniéndose conectado con lo que ama más después de su familia, sus animales y la naturaleza.En los últimos años René descubrió una nueva pasión, el conservacionismo. Él encontró muchas especies de pájaros y animales que habitaban en las tierras que él recorría y soñaba con crear un santuario en donde todos estos animales pudieran vivir sin tener temor de que los mataran. Él sacaba las fotos más increíbles en estos viajes que él hacía a estas hermosas tierras.  Una de ellas, una serpiente ""Tragavenado"" enrollada alrededor de un venado cuando se disponía a tragárselo, apareció en una publicación mensual en los Estados Unidos.  Como ésta, recuerdo también la foto de un pájaro de color rojo vibrante posado sobre un alambre de una cerca en esas tierras tropicales. Simplemente hermoso.Cuando escuchamos de la noticia de la enfermedad de René, supimos que iba a ser una batalla difícil, pero él ha sido bendecido con el amor de su familia y de buenos amigos quienes lo están ayudando en esta fase de su vida.  Con el propósito de buscar tratamientos que pudieran sanarlo, René vino a los Estados Unidos a principios de 2019.René se encuentra actualmente en el Baptist Hospital en Miami y le han ofrecido un tratamiento que pudiera curar su enfermedad.  Este tratamiento ya ha comenzado puesto que no hay tiempo que perder. el pago será entregado tan pronto como se logren recaudar los fondos necesarios.  El costo es alrededor de $70,000, aparte de todos los exámenes de diagnósticos, etc. El acaba de terminar su primera dosis de quimioterapia. Él tenia miedo, pero pareciera haber salido de ésta con muy pocos efectos secundarios. Una respuesta a la oración. Estos tratamientos son costosos y nuestra oración es que podamos recaudar los fondos necesarios para pagarlos pronto. Estamos extendiendo este mensaje al mundo para pedir ayuda para cubrir estos gastos.  Si usted se siente con el deseo de contribuir, estaremos eternamente agradecidos. Si todo lo que usted puede hacer es orar, eso también sería un gran regalo. Necesitamos todas las oraciones que podamos conseguir.  Oren por paz y fortaleza para René mientras pasa por este proceso, por su familia para que se mantengan fuertes y por sabiduría para el personal médico que lo atiende. Gracias por su consideración y por leer la historia de René.La familia Finol.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Français]Chère famille, amis, amis des amis,En août 2018, nous avons appris la triste nouvelle : notre René tant aimé a été diagnostiqué d’un cancer du pancréas. C’est là que tout a basculé et qu’a débuté notre combat pour essayer de le sauver. René a une famille merveilleuse. Il vit au Vénézuela avec son épouse et ses 4 enfants. Il a été éleveur toute sa vie, et c’est difficile de le voir avec une autre tenue que celle de cow-boy, avec son élégant chapeau et ses bottes. Depuis très jeune, René a une connexion spéciale avec la nature, habitué à se balader dans les terres de sa famille. Durant les 20 dernières années, le Vénézuela est passé par une des pires crises de l’histoire, qui a empiré avec le temps. Les terres privées ont été envahies avec l’approbation d’un gouvernement corrompu, le prix des propriétés a chuté dû à la dévaluation de la monnaie nationale, le prix de la nourriture et autres bien de première nécessité a grimpé de façon exponentielle, avec une hyperinflation de centaines de milliers de pourcent qui ne cesse de continuer à augmenter. Les hôpitaux n’ont pas échappé à la crise non plus. Tout ceci a poussé des millions de personnes à fuir le pays. Malgré tout, René est resté, afin de continuer à prendre soin de ses terres et à rester connecté avec ce qu’il aime le plus après sa famille : les animaux et la nature. Ces dernières années, René s’est découvert une nouvelle passion pour la conservation de la nature. Il a découvert de nombreuses espèces d’oiseaux et animaux vivant sur les terres qu’il parcourait, et il rêve de créer un sanctuaire où tous ces animaux pourraient vivre sans avoir peur d’être chassés ou tués. Il prenait des photos exceptionnelles durant ces voyages ; une d’entre elles a même été publiée dans une revue mensuelle aux Etats-Unis. Quand nous avons appris la nouvelle de la maladie de René, nous savions que le combat allait être difficile, mais il bénéficie de tout l’amour de sa famille et de proches qui l’aident à traverser cette étape. Etant donné la situation précaire au Vénézuela et l’impossibilité de se faire soigner correctement, René est parti aux Etats-Unis au début de cette année afin d’y recevoir un traitement adéquat. Il se trouve actuellement à l’hôpital Baptist à Miami, où on lui offre un traitement qui pourrait le sauver. Ce traitement a déjà commencé, il n’y a pas de temps à perdre. Nous avons la chance d’avoir obtenu un délai afin de pouvoir récolter environ 70.000$ qui permettront de lui offrir un traitement complet (en-dehors des examens etc). René vient de terminer sa première chimiothérapie. Il avait très peur, mais il en est sorti avec très peu d’effets secondaires, ce qui est rassurant.  Ces traitements sont coûteux et notre plus grand souhait est de pouvoir récolter les fonds nécessaires afin de pouvoir payer rapidement ces frais. Nous faisons passer ce message au monde entier afin de solliciter votre aide. Si vous avez le désir de contribuer et de faire un petit geste pour notre René bien aimé, nous vous en serions éternellement reconnaissants. Autrement, vos pensées sont plus que bienvenues, pour toutes les forces nécessaires que René devra aller puiser, pour que sa famille reste forte, et pour le personnel médical qui prend soin de lui. Merci pour votre considération et pour avoir lu l’histoire de René.La famille Finol.",34573b50e409d3a47a03fd95d2ff2c5c,85,0.11342857142857143,5.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Wyatt is the first child to have this rare form of brain cancer and because of it’s location and size, it is inoperable. There is no standard form of treatment for Wyatt’s rare cancer but his doctors feel chemotherapy is currently his only option.          It is heartbreaking to see our son who loves to hunt, fish with his grandpa and race around on his dirt bike, suffer through the effects of chemotherapy.  While we are trying to maintain a “normal life” the financial struggle we are now in is only adding to the emotional and physical toll cancer is having on our family.  They say it takes a village to raise a child...well it takes even more to save a child's life.     Medical bills are pouring in and they will only continue.  We are 3 1/2 hours away from Wyatt’s doctors at UCSF, bi-weekly blood tests, prescriptions, hotel stays for treatment, the list goes on and on…Our hope in setting up this page is to receive help for Wyatt and the expensive task of saving his life.

She was in a cast until July of 2018. Since then Audrey has been in and out of physical therapy. Recently it was discovered that her bone was not healing properly. A biopsy was performed and Audrey’s test results confirmed in January of 2019 that she had Adamantinoma, which is a rare tumor in her bone.  This cancer makes up less than 1% of all bone cancers. Audrey’s surgery is set for February 8, 2019.Over the next 3 to 6 months Audrey will require surgery to remove half of her tibia, she will then be put into a metal brace called an external fixator. Audrey will require weekly follow up appointments and physical therapy to ensure that she can have normal living conditions. Though this is a traumatic incident for her, she still has a high spirit and a bright smile each and every day.For those who know Pao and Padra, they are the most loving, selfless, and giving individuals. The funds will be used  to help pay for Audrey’s medical expenses and physical therapy to lessen the financial burden on them; as Pao’s work place does not offer paid medical leave and Padra has exhausted her leave when they had their new born baby in October of 2018. Our family sincerely wants to thank each and everyone of you in advance for your donation, generosity and prayers.",9c9d84a4efc1896fa7bf9651e64443e4,12,1.031,8.0,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

She was not relieved of the pain, but she finally had validation from a doctor that the pain was actually real! After months of pain and years of seeing doctors for what she was told were minor issues, she was finally diagnosed.  This came just shy of three weeks after the birth of her third child, Maxwell. While recovering from her C-section surgery, taking care of her beautiful 3 and 4 year old daughters (Isabella and Alexandra) as well as her new baby boy, she was told the pain that was supposed to “go away after the baby was born” was Colorectal Cancer!  Sadly, although this was an extreme shock to our entire family, she told us that she wasn’t actually surprised, but thankful that not another person would tell her to live with the pain she had been enduring. Deep down, Charlotte had known something was wrong, she just needed a doctor to see it for themselves to figure out what was actually wrong. From December 26th, her world began to spin into that of CT scans, biopsies, MRI’s and meetings after meetings with doctors and surgeons for second and third opinions.  Finally, after multiple tests had been completed and Charlotte had traveled across New England to meet with several doctors, Charlotte was diagnosed with Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer.  As many of you may know, Stage 4 Cancer means the cancer has spread from it’s primary origin to another organ, or multiple organs, in the body. In Charlotte’s case, the cancer has spread from her Colon, to her liver and also her lungs.  As a family, we have been completely overwhelmed and more than touched by the outpour of people who want to help and support Charlotte.  So many of you have asked how you can help and support and although it’s a VERY tough thing for Charlotte to accept or ask for, she now needs your help.Charlotte has always been the angel in our family. She lives in this world touching so many people with her desire and love of giving.  She has always sacrificed herself for the betterment of the people around her. She is a silent giver, never wanting or needing recognition or even a thank you.  We want to be able to give her back what she has so seamlessly and willingly given to others. Charlotte and her wonderful and supportive husband Gaston, have all of a sudden found themselves in need of a significant amount of additional child care as she has started her journey, that will become even more necessary as she continues her Chemotherapy. They both have needed transportation care for her daughters and infant care both day and night for Maxwell which is adding a huge cost to their already increasing expenses.  We would love to help them defer these costs, and are asking for your help.We would also love to help not only with the care of Charlotte’s family, but to also help fund enjoyable family experiences as they embark on this Cancer journey.  Cancer has entered their life and is taking so much of their energy and resources. We want them to be able to enjoy every beautiful moment they have ‘in between the Cancer’ and would appreciate any help in funding that would enable her family to share special times together “away” from Cancer.As many of you know, if you are unable to support Charlotte and her family monetarily, there is a meal train to help provide meals during Charlotte’s treatment.  This has and will continue to be a massive help for Charlotte that she will continue to update as her diet needs change. She and her family very much appreciate the delicious meals that have been delivered the last few weeks.  Here is the Meal Train link below: https://www.TakeThemAMeal.com/KVTY2385Lastly, and most importantly, Charlotte would love that you join her in prayer. As many of you know Charlotte is a passionate member of the Baha’i Faith and Baha’i community in Portsmouth. Baha’u’llah, the founder of the Baha’i Faith has revealed special prayers for both spiritual and material healing and considers it our duty to use such prayers (in addition to medical treatment) and to put our trust in the all-sustaining and all-healing power of God.“Thy name is my healing, O my God, and remembrance of Thee is my remedy. Nearness to Thee is my hope, and love for Thee is my companion. Thy mercy to me is my healing and my succor in both this world and the world to come. Thou, verily, art the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”  ~Baha’u’llah~Charlotte began her first Chemotherapy treatment this week as a clinical trial patient with a skilled team at Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts.  We are so fortunate to be working with this wonderful and skilled team of professionals, and we are all positive and extremely hopeful for Charlotte as she starts this journey.We all thank you so much for your love, support and prayers.  We could not be on this journey without you. Please spread the word and keep the love strong.Love to you all,Charlotte’s Sisters (Nikki, Dominique, Hannah) https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/charlottengarukiye/journal#4sistersstrong#chazstrong",8206b09c76c89e3313fb29d59f682960,33,0.972125,11.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I was rushed from our local hospital by ambulance down to Banner University Medical Center in Phoenix, because I was having tachycardia and had a massive amount of fluid surrounding my heart and one lung. At Banner, they drained 3 liters off of my heart and lung during the first night I was admitted. They ran tests on the fluids surrounding my heart and lungs. I'll never forget December 8th, after multitudes of doctors came in from pulmonolgy, cardiology, obstericians, internal medicine and then finally an oncologist came in, he was the first doctor that pulled a chair out, and he sat down to tell me, that in the fluid, they found cells of malignancy. At that time, I was 23 weeks pregnant. And I couldn't even believe what he was saying. I was in complete shock. Up until the point of being hospitalized, I was a normal mom to a crazy 17 month old boy. Working full time, cooking and cleaning. I had been feeling run down, but I attributed it to the pregnancy and possibly having the flu. Little did I know that my lung was being collapsed because of the fluid pressure buildup. I had never heard of adenocarcinoma before. The oncologist told me that I have non small cell lung cancer.  After weeks of monitoring and getting the fluid build up reduced, I was released from the hospital without any tubes. But just one week after leaving the hospital I had a pulmonolgy appointment. During the ultrasound, the doctor found a significant fluid reaccumulation. He wanted to drain it, and place a pleurex catheter immediately. As of now, I need to drain the catheter in my lung, every other day.  I plan on beginning treatment as soon as I have all the tests back from the oncologist, and can evaluate my choices. Being pregnant complicates this. I am sure that the holidays have delayed a lot of the labs.  I am asking for donations to help with the medical bills, and because right now, I am unable to work.",ce1372b06bf7f450c59393e43a678d16,23,0.19875,30.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

They were married in 2013 after a whirlwind romance. Their great love grew even stronger in 2014 when their son, Rowdy, was born and again in 2016 with a daughter, Summer Jo. In 2017, they moved to Florida and found their new home sweet home.Caleb and Kristen are an exceedingly talented couple. There isn’t anything they set their hands to that doesn’t turn to beauty. While Caleb’s strengths are surely in craftsmanship, he left his job in construction to pursue his ultimate dream: music. He learned how to play violin at a young age, alongside his twin brother Daniel, and ever since there was a tune in his heart that he so desperately wanted to share. After many months of searching for the best spot to base their family and his new career, Caleb and Kristen found their perfect fit in Tarpon Springs, FL in 2017. Since then, Caleb has financially supported his family with Cal Morris Music and developed a devoted following in Tarpon Springs and beyond.Caleb’s Diagnosis:On the cusp of a busy music season, Caleb thought it best to go checked out by the doctor on his day off. He was experiencing some out of the ordinary stomach symptoms and wanted to be healthy for the long weeks ahead. The doctor’s office ran routine blood-work, and the results came back as abnormal. Their doctor sent them to the ER, and within hours they were admitted with a prognosis of “you should probably prepare for the worst.” Caleb and Kristen spent the next four days in the hospital meeting with specialists and running tests. On Friday, November 16th they were given the diagnosis their hearts most feared: it was cancer. Not leukemia as they initially thought, but a rare form of blood cancer known as MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndromes).This week, Caleb and Kristen will meet with a team of oncologists to decide on the way forward. He will likely require a bone marrow transplant, chemotherapy and a host of other treatments. He will be placed in periods of isolation, time away from his children, his family and friends, and his work. The hardship to their family, financially, emotionally, and spiritually will be immense.Your Contribution:If you know Caleb and Kristen, you know they’ve experienced more personal heartbreak than most their age. Nonetheless, they’ve stood firm, with unfailing faith in their Lord, in the midst of overwhelming personal loss. Not only are they some of the strongest people out there, but they are also some of the most generous. As a recipient of their care for so many years, we’re here to support them in return, to fight this battle with them, and to remind them that no matter what may come, they will not walk this road alone. We believe they will weather this storm, that they will be sustained and carried by others, and that Caleb will walk away from this wholly healed.Your financial support will release Kristen to care for Caleb full time and for Caleb to focus on fighting the battle ahead. Your contributions will also provide the essential needs their family requires to put a roof over their head, pay for health premiums, and cover day to day living expenses.If you are unable to contribute financially, we’re grateful you’ve been able to read a small part of their story. We, along with Caleb and Kristen, pray it would point you to a God who saves and sustains in the midst of the hardships of life.",5b5c535645d78d233c9027e0aa02feb3,23,0.9602666666666667,60.0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

There is a large tumor in my rectum.March 2018 – Start 10 weeks of radiation and chemotherapy. During this time I lost about 30 pounds and became very weak.Summer 2018 – Put weight back on and lots more tests to see how well the tumor shrunk.August 2018 – Went for a laproscopic surgery on my liver to remove 3 cancerous spots.Sept 2018 – First round didn’t shrink the tumor as much as my surheon would have liked so I tart a second, more intense round of chemotherapy that lasts until November 2018. During this time I was unable to drink or eat anything cold, and the skin peeled off of my palms and bottoms of feet. Still feeling the effects of that on my feet.December 2018 – Chemotherapy worked extremely well this time, the tumor has now shrunken down to a flat, white scar. Doctor still suggests surgery to remove the part of my rectum where the tumor is.January 2019 – Go for a major surgery to remove an inch of my rectum.It has been about a month since my surgery and I am wearing a temporary ostomy bag in the meantime before we can run more tests in approximately 3 months. The drain they installed to get rid of any built up nastiness during the surgery didn’t worked exactly as planned and I had to go back to the hospital for another week long stay to have another one put in that I have been wearing for the last 3 weeks. The location makes it very uncomfortable to sleep, or do most of my normal activities but hopefully it will be coming out next week.I also had a meeting with my chemotherapy oncologist last week who recommends I go for another 3 months of intense chemotherapy to make sure any cancer cells are eliminated, so I will be starting that up again in the next week or two.After chemotherapy (sometime in May or June) I will be ready for more tests and hopefully another surgery to reverse the ostomy that was put in and re-attach my small intestine to my rectum.At this point, recovery is going to be a long and slow process, having this second drain has hindered my progress by a month and I am still coping with living with this ostomy bag. My mobility is limited, I cant drive, cook, clean, lift anything over 5 lbs, its just very difficult taking care of myself right now.What this means is that I will have to continue my unemployment for approximately another year. I am receiving some financial assistance from the government, but it barely covers my rent and definitely not the rest of my monthly expenses. The funds donated will be going to things such as: healthy food and groceries, monthly bills, additional services and treatments not covered by MSP (Vit C IV, body treatment, naturopath visits)As much as I didn’t want to make another one of these, I am reaching out to ask for your help again. Would like to thank everyone for this past year of support, financial, emotional, and otherwise. People bringing me food, or rides here and there, the generosity of family, friends and community have made this burden a lot easier to bear, and I could not be more grateful.I have located a few boxes of the last record I put out as well, so anyone that donates more than $20 can get one from me until they are gone. If you want one from last time you donated, no problem, just send me a message! Thank you from the entirety of my heart, this has been a difficult process with a long ways to go still, but I am so confident that I am on the road to beating this thing again, I definitely could not do it without the help from everyone reading this.

Sometimes stepping up at a time in need is just what we have to do. Allow me to introduce to you, the Leon family! The Leon family is just one of many beloved McCaffry Photography families. This family is going through a really difficult time currently, and needs our help.  This amazing family has granted me permission to share their story. I took updated family pictures for them yesterday, 11/24/18. Out of respect,  I will not be sharing those images. However, I was given permission to share this image of Andrea and I, in order to share their story. This is me, Lindsey - owner of McCaffry Photography LLC with not just a client, but a friend. This particular image was taken at the end of our session yesterday while I was giving my usual thank you, goodbye, hugs. Matt, Andrea's husband picked up my camera to capture the moment. He laughed when doing so and said, ""this is too complicated, I can't figure it out."" Luckily Heather came along to help with the session. Matt grabbed her and she was able to capture this for us. 


Andrea is a friend who is fighting one of life's worst battles. Andrea was diagnosed with stage 4 cervical cancer in February 2017. The other image you see is the last family pictures I took for them in September of 2016. Five months before her diagnosis. This family has been fighting this battle for almost 2 long years. I don't know of a more deserving family in need of some holiday cheer, not to mention some much needed relief! If you know this family, you know they would never ask for any help. That is where I come in. At times like this you just need someone to step in and tell you they want to help. All of us here at McCaffry Photography are asking.... if you are able, and willing. Please help this family find a little bit of relief during this very difficult time. All proceeds will go directly to Matt & Andrea Leon.

 I ask that you keep not only me in your prayers, but my husband Jason and children as well.  While we will have family and friends assisting us, Jason will be shouldering the brunt of the burden; trying to work when he can and take care of our home and four young children.  Thank you for reading my story and for your prayers and financial blessings.  Please share my story with your families and friends.  I will keep you updated on my treatment and progress.  Miracles still happen!  To God be the Glory.  Blessings to you.  Anne Bevers",130d1897d3ea9cc8b571f06a83dc903b,54,0.60235,210.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

We set aside our fears of the icy water and numbingly cold temperatures to fundraise for the Ken Pribil Jr. Foundation in support of cancer research. We ask for your support; whether by donation or by cheering us on, to stand with us and fundraise for our 2019 cancer research grant. Select 'Donate Now' or 'Share' to support our cause and spread the news!In December 2018, the Ken Pribil Jr. Foundation delivered it's largest cancer research grant ever; $15,000 toward sarcoma research studies at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. This was made possible by our first 3 Polar Plunges raising over $10,000, coupled with additional fundraising efforts.Donations go directly to the Ken Pribil Jr. Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization, and are tax deductible. Created in memory of Ken Jr., a Rockville Centre, NY native who lost his battle to AngioSarcoma cancer at the young age of 19, the Ken Pribil Jr. Foundation has granted over $25,000 to reputable cancer research institutions and awarded 18 college scholarships to graduating high school students.

Lots of tears, intense physical pain, the inability to sleep, and feelings of despair. As you know, I did extensive research on clinics all over the world and decided I want to get treatment at the Hope 4 Cancer Institute in Mexico. It’s a 3 week inpatient program of cutting edge nontoxic treatments, they treat the disease holistically, and I know it’s the right place for me. It includes a plethora of different daily treatments from 7 different modalities: Non-Toxic Cancer Therapies, ImmunoModulation, Full Spectrum Nutrition, Detoxification, Oxygenation, Restore Microbiome, and Emotional/Spiritual Healing. It also includes accommodations for 2 (so Jeff can come with me), 3 organic vegan meals per day plus organic juices and smoothies for both me and Jeff, and two follow-up visits for me after 3 months and 6 months. When I leave, they give me enough Sunivera Immunotherapy (which includes GcMAF) and MaraGen to continue my treatments at home for 3 months, and the Sono Photo Dynamic Therapy device I need to continue that treatment at home for 1 year. The cost is $47,000, which is why I started this GoFundMe page. The campaign started off gangbusters, but has tapered off, not surprisingly. What you don’t know is that I have a large inoperable tumor over my sternum that is attached to my sternum bone and chest wall and it’s been growing quite aggressively, so every day that goes by where I am in physical pain and not able to start treatment has been unbearable.A couple named Olivia and Larry Cook saw my post about this on Instagram ~ their account is @naturalhelperx. They reached out to me as philanthropists who want to give as much as possible to people in need before the end of 2018. I was so excited, and I emailed them all about my situation. They replied that they could send me all the money I needed, but I would have to send them a $107 transfer fee. My heart sank. I Googled their email address and discovered that they are scam artists who prey upon homeless people and people in dire health crises. I started sobbing tears of despair.Well, today I am crying tears of joy. Jeff did something heroic for me, something he would ordinarily have never considered ~ he made an early withdrawal from the IRA he’s had since high school to get me the remaining money I need to start my treatment! We’re leaving early tomorrow (Monday) morning, and we will be back on Christmas Day! There is a 60-day window within which he can replace that money so as to maintain the health and integrity of the account and not have to pay taxes and major penalties on that early withdrawal, so I am determined to make that happen. If you can make a donation, even if it’s just a few dollars, I would be eternally grateful. Every bit helps. GoFundMe does take 3% of each donation, so if you'd prefer to donate to me via PayPal, my email is funny@suzannewhang.com -- be sure to use the ""Send to Friends and Family"" option so that I don't get charged a service fee.Or you can mail me a check ~ send an email to me at gookwaffle@gmail.com and I will give you my address.I am SO relieved and excited to start my treatment! Thanks to every one of you for your emotional and financial support, and special thanks to Jeff Vezain, my twin flame, the love of my life, and my knight in shining armor.  By the way, we never got around to breaking up...Send me good energy, and I look forward to regaling you with magnificent stories about my path back to wellness!Love,Suzanne+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Original post (11/15/18)Holy crapwaffle.  I can't believe this is happening again.  I'm taking this Asian overachiever thing to a whole new level.  You know how they say God doesn't give you anything you can't handle?  Well, God must really think I'm a badass.  Here's a video of my journey that was done in 2015: https://youtu.be/-MjDg0n_R1kBack in 2011 when I was given 6 months to live from stage 4 breast cancer, I went $500,000 in debt from cancer treatments that were not covered by my insurance.  With the help of family, friends, and fans back then, I raised about $250,000 from online fundraisers and fundraising events.  I thought I had reversed the cancer and was cancer-free since 2011, but it turns out that while the tumors were gone, the cancer stem cells were not.I wanted to gather as much information as possible before creating this fundraiser.Don't let my goal amount intimidate you.  Every dollar helps.So... here's the latest chapter of my story.  On the evening of Oct 15th as I was driving home from my friend Vanessa’s birthday party ~ I started experiencing intense chest pains, shortness of breath, and tingling in my left arm.  I thought I was having a heart attack, so I asked Jeff to take me to the emergency room at Providence St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank.  I also have a bump over my sternum from what I thought was costochondritis caused by my T-10 vertebra kyphoplasty back in 2011.  Several times in the past, I've had costochondritis which is inflammation caused by lifting something heavy and irritating the area over the sternum ~ I would ice it and rest for a few days, and it would disappear completely.  The ER doctor, Dr. Herrera, did an EKG on me, and it came back normal.  That ruled out a STEMI heart attack.  Then he did blood tests on my cardiac enzymes that all came back normal.  That ruled out a non-STEMI heart attack and a blood clot.  Then he did an x-ray of my sternum, which came back normal.  That ruled out a broken bone.  And then he did a CT scan.  About an hour later, Dr. Herrera came into to my ER room with the CT scan results and a sad look on his face.  He said that this bump over my sternum is cancerous.  He said that's what was causing my chest pains.  He also found lesions on the bone of my sternum, on two of my ribs, and in both of my lungs.  The test results are consistent with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer.  So this is now my second time with stage 4 cancer.  Fuck.  He gave me a tiny dose of morphine to help me with the pain (the dosage they use for small children), because I am a lightweight when it comes to medication.I was devastated.  Jeff was in the ER hospital room with me when I got the CT scan results, thank God.  He's been incredibly kind and loving and supportive.  Then I remembered a documentary that a friend recently told me about called ""The Truth About Cancer,"" so I watched it.I already knew some of the information from my research in 2011, but a lot of it was brand new to me and incredibly eye-opening.  It was fascinating, infuriating, and ultimately inspiring.Here it is, if you haven't seen it and are interested.Episode 1:   https://youtu.be/KqJAzQe7_0gEpisode 2:   https://youtu.be/VK_sX5ko8SEI am now energized and optimistic about reclaiming my health and curing the cancer at the root, this time permanently.The next day after being in the emergency room, I was on the phone on hold for 6 hours with different physicians and branches of Medi-Cal (the health insurance that I have), in order to get an approved referral to Dr. Berkowitz, who was my oncologist in 2011 and the only holistic oncologist I've ever encountered.  He's awesome because he's open-minded.  I'm working towards getting referred to him, which is turning out to be much more difficult that I was told.In the meantime, I've been using CBD, cannabis salve, frankincense oil, and eating organic vegan.  After extensive research, I have selected the Hope 4 Cancer Institute in Baja.  It's an inpatient 3-week program.  Here is a link to the clinic: http://www.hope4cancer.com/I will be receiving Sono Photo Dynamic Therapy: https://hope4cancer.com/our-therapies/sono-photo-dynamic-therapy/And will be given what I need to continue my therapy for one year at home after I check out of the clinic.And MaraGen: https://ph.pronuvia.com/products/maragen/I will be given a 3 month supply to continue taking at home after I check out of the clinic.I will also be receiving Sunivera Immunotherapy: https://hope4cancer.com/our-therapies/sunivera-immunotherapy/And I will receive injections to continue the treatment at home for one year.I need to raise $47,000 ASAP ~ because the sooner I get to the clinic, the sooner I can start these treatments.The reason I'm trying to raise more money is because I don't want to stress about having to work for a couple of months, and my new healthy lifestyle will include food and supplements and treatments in LA to maintain my health (including things like acupuncture, massage, hyperbaric oxygen, hyperthermia, etc.)Please feel free to share this fundraiser with anyone you think might be willing to help me.Remember, if you're wealthy, you can donate up to $14,000 tax-free as a gift to any individual once a year.  Hope 4 Cancer Institute's program includes transportation from San Diego, accommodations for 3 weeks, 3 organic vegetarian meals daily, juices and smoothies, not just for me, but for a companion as well -- Jeff is going to come with me!  It includes every treatment each day (up to 8 different kinds), and all the treatments I take with me to continue at home.Here's how you can help me ~ visualize me getting better permanently this time, eradicating all the cancer stem cells this time.  Don't worry about me or tell me how worried you are.  That's doesn't help me.If you don't agree with my path, keep it to yourself.  I have done thousands of hours of research since 2006, and I am in charge of my recovery.  If you want to share with me some new revolutionary treatment or holistic or naturopathic or nutrition-based information, first ask me if I've tried it or heard of it, and then ask if I want to learn more.If you can't afford to make a donation, please share this with someone who might be able to.Thank you in advance for caring about me.  I know that once again, I will be loved back to life.And if I happen to see you somewhere out and about in the LA area, please hug me gently, because of my sternum tumor.  I am in a lot of pain today, but most days I feel good.With love, gratitude, optimism, and confidence that I will reclaim my health

https://www.gofundme.com/laura-studer039s-answer-to-cancer,Laura Studer's Answer To Cancer,2018-10-12,10.0,2018.0,20078.0,40000.0,159.0,126.27672955974843,2524,"When Laura was first diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer 2-1/2 years ago, she felt that there was no time to explore her treatment options because of the advanced state and aggressive nature of her cancer.   She followed the treatment plan recommended by her oncologist; yet knowing that she would conduct research and choose a more benign treatment if her cancer did not respond to chemotherapy, or if it reoccurred in the future.         If you know Laura and have followed her journey in recent years, you already know that her answer to cancer is well-considered and based on significant research, logic, courage, positive attitude and an extremely strong and intuitive will. When she makes a decision about the best path for HER, she exercises great discipline and grace as she pursues it without complaint.         Laura was very successful in beating the cancer 2 years ago but, unfortunately, the cancer has returned.  This time, she is hoping to embark on a new path of treatment; one that will kill her circulating cells and also destroy the latent stem cells.  The timing is not good, because she is currently out of work (due to downsizing) and the treatment (although very effective) is not covered by insurance.  She can only get the treatment she wants and needs, Insulin Potentiation Therapy, WITH YOUR HELP!A REVIEW of Laura's Challenge:        During what was believed to be a routine hysterectomy in May 2016, Laura’s surgeon discovered a massive tumor and widespread metastases, which was diagnosed as a gynecological cancer known as Malignant Mixed Mullerian Tumor (MMMT), stage 4b.  MMMT is an extremely rare and aggressive cancer that is both carcinoma AND sarcoma.  Her excellent surgeon, Dr. Warren James, removed the large tumor and whatever cancer he could find at the time.  Subsequent scans showed the cancer had also established tumors in her liver, abdomen, omentum, both lungs, and was circulating in her bloodstream.          Laura’s recovery from the extensive surgery was remarkably smooth, and the very surprised staff released her from the hospital a day or two sooner than they had expected.  Because her cancer was already so widespread and moving fast, Laura agreed to undergo chemotherapy treatments.  She wanted to slow the progression while using the time to do additional research about her options. After 6 rounds of Carboplatin AND Taxol, she was told that her body couldn’t tolerate any more treatments because of her extremely low cell count/platelets.  Although her tumors had reduced in size by only 30%, her doctors had nothing else to offer her. Laura's first day of chemotherapy, June 2016.ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT CHOICES:        While Laura was undergoing chemotherapy, we researched options for alternative treatments and natural ways to treat cancer, preparing for the day her body could not endure more chemo.  Oncologists had discouraged the use of any/all supplemental treatments that would lessen or counteract the chemo meds, but when Laura could no longer tolerate chemo, she already had a plan in place. After tormenting her oncologists with questions about alternative therapies, they suggested she visit a local integrative medicine physician, Dr. Roger Billica, here in Fort Collins.        Dr. Billica is a former medical director for NASA, and is extremely well-versed in treating disease with plants, vitamins, minerals, oxygen, ozone, diet and many other alternative therapies which were utilized in the space program and around the world.  He explained “there are no drug stores in space”, so they have to treat illness with whatever is in their refrigerator or on board. He introduced us to a world of options, but the most valuable tool he provided, by far, was access to the ‘Greek Test’, a diagnostic tool that is not done in the US but is allowed in many other countries on multiple continents.  This test is also known as a circulating tumor test (NOT the same as the test by that same name which is done in the US) or chemo-sensitivity test. Dr. Billica sent a sample of Laura’s blood to the RGCC labs in Greece, where they grew her cancer in the lab and tested the effectiveness of a huge list of chemotherapy drugs, alkylating agents, adjuvant therapies and NATURAL substances on her specific cancer. They sent Laura a thorough report that indicated, by percentage, how effective each item was in killing her particular cancer cells.  We found that we had access to acquire many of the adjuvant therapies and natural substances through Dr. Billica, online or from other sources.  This report became our blueprint for how to proceed, and instilled a comfortable confidence that we could beat the cancer.        Here is a link to the RGCC website:  https://www.rgcc-group.com . I will not publish her report here, but if you are seeking answers to illness, contact us directly and we will show you Laura’s report so you know what to expect. The cost of the test is app. $3K (the U.S. price varies with the currency exchange rate).        We started making capsules and suppositories for Laura, using the items listed on her Greek Test that were proven to kill her cancer cells.  We also figured out that suppositories were 3 to 5 times more effective (bio-available) in administering these supplements, with NO side effects or impact on her digestive or gastrointestinal tract – making it MUCH easier for her to take the quantities needed.  Laura also changed to an organic and ketogenic diet, and received massage, acupuncture, hyperbaric oxygen, ozone and high-dose vitamin C therapies.HAPPY DAYS --  REMISSION!!!               Exactly one year from the day that her surgeon discovered Laura’s many tumors and metastases, her PET scan showed “NO active cancer cells”!  We were surprised and ecstatic about these results, even though we knew the stem cells were probably still present, waiting to wreak havoc in the future. Nevertheless, we have become steadfast believers in 1) the ‘Greek Test’; 2) suppositories to administer supplements; and 3) the proven power of plants and natural immunotherapy. But until she can break the dormant stem cells, this beast will keep coming. Hence her new plan, as explained below.        Laura was in remission for a little over a year, and enjoyed traveling with friends, going to family reunions in Minnesota, and living pain-free. Laura at the Grand Canyon, May 2018.Laura and Diana in Sedona, AZ, May, 2018.RECURRENCE:               Earlier this year, Laura began having pain in her right shin. After seeing several doctors about it and having imaging (X-ray and MRI) that looked normal, they concluded it was shin splints.  That seemed highly unlikely, but she thought perhaps her gait was altered from her scoliosis or, perhaps, as a result of her major surgery the year before. The pain continued, and a few months later, she began experiencing constant muscle spasm pain and general weakness in her right leg, just above her knee, where a raised lump was visibly growing.  A full-body PET scan showed a large sarcoma growing in/on her femur. The tumor had eroded more than half of her femur, leaving doctors amazed that her leg had not snapped, especially considering her recent hiking vacation in Arizona.  She was immediately ordered to be totally non-weight bearing until surgery could be performed.        On July 5th, she underwent major surgery in Denver to remove the sarcoma and stabilize the leg.  A sarcoma the size of a goose egg was removed and sent to pathology. They inserted a titanium rod through the center of her femur from hip to knee and secured each end with a pair of screws. The large void left when the tumor was removed was filled with bone cement, and the 4 surgical incisions were glued shut.  Her hospital recovery was, again, remarkably uneventful (except for a bad reaction to opioids). Laura had lost a lot of blood during the surgery, so she had to stay an extra day while they were trying to get her vital signs stabilized enough for our trip home.Pre-surgery X-Rays of Laura's right femur, June 2018.Pre-surgery PET Scan 'slice' of Laura's femur, June 2018.July 2018:  Post-surgery femur w/rod, screws, cement. July 2018: Post-surgery x-ray at hip.LAURA'S CURRENT TREATMENT CHOICE:         After successful surgery to remove the sarcoma and stabilize the bone, Laura received ten radiation therapy treatments to the region where the sarcoma had been.  She still needs to undergo some type of systemic treatment, to go after the cancer cells that are traveling in her bloodstream, looking for places to settle.  Her oncologists tried to find a clinical trial for Laura, but her cancer is so rare there were none.  Their remaining advice is that Laura take a daily oral chemotherapy drug, Affinitor, to slow the progression of the cancer. But our research into the testing and approval of this drug lead us to believe it is too toxic.  It will permanently alter and/or damage her good cells AND bad cells, and, based on test results, it seems to only slow the progression for as long as it takes the cancer to adapt to it; generally six months to a year. It will not kill the cancer or the cancer’s stem cells. Laura has decided not to take this drug, choosing instead her preferred “go-to” plan for times like this.        The PLAN:   There is an alternative therapy that has been on Laura’s Wish List if her cancer should ever become active again.  Insulin Potentiation Therapy, “IPT”, is a therapeutic option that combines targeted elements of traditional chemotherapy, administered efficiently with adjuvant agents, and combined with the best natural (food & supplements) treatments proven, in laboratory testing, to cure Laura’s specific cancer. Here’s how it works:1)   Laura had a new ‘Greek Test’ performed last month that identifies what substances proved effective (in the lab) against her current cancer cells. She now has an updated list of effective chemo and natural agents to use to annihilate her cancer. Her goal now is to prevent any future recurrence by cracking through the stem cells’ hard protein-coated shell with a targeted lethal cocktail.2)   In a closely-monitored clinical setting, Laura’s blood sugar will gradually be brought to a dramatically lowered level and sustained until her cancer cells are desperately screaming for sugar/glucose.  [Side note - Normal, healthy cells have 1 sugar receptor; but cancer cells have 17 to 20 sugar receptors each.  Those cells crave sugar for life and energy to divide and grow]. The cancer cells’ ravenous consumption of sugar/glucose explains why doctors inject radioactive sugar during PET scans. As the cancer cells aggressively gulp the radioactive sugars, the scan can photograph the glowing areas, known as ‘headlights’, to see where cancer is residing.  IPT functions similarly, except instead of using sugar to light up and photograph the cancer cells, it uses sugar to deliver a killing blow to the cancer. 3)   At the optimum moment, Laura will receive a low dose (10 – 15% of the typical dose) of Nedaplatin, the chemotherapy drug that tested 85% effective against her cancer in the lab. The chemotherapy and other agents (from her lab results) will be administered with insulin, triggering the cells to seek sugar/glucose. By the time this solution enters the bloodstream, the cancer cells, including stem cells, will grab the mixture quickly, leaving little opportunity for her healthy cells to take in much, if any. This method of delivering cytotoxins directly into cancer cells is targeted like a Trojan horse, and there should be little impact to her healthy cells.  Laura will receive treatments 2-3 hours each day for three weeks.  The continuous three week schedule is designed to relentlessly outlast the cancer’s ability to survive and adapt. The stem cells will be toast.4)   While at the clinic, Laura will also receive many immune-boosting minerals and supplements (after testing for deficiencies); other alternative therapies like acupuncture; and nutrition training (which we already know, somewhat).        This treatment protocol should have little to no side effects, other than that she will feel lousy while her blood sugar is lowered before each infusion.  She should not lose her hair again or have lasting damage or neuropathy. I have attached a link to a short description about IPT. I chose this article it for its brevity, but it is not an ideal explanation, nor is this the doctor or clinic Laura plans to utilize: https://www.cancertutor.com/ipt/         Laura plans to go to the Forsythe Cancer Clinic in Nevada for her treatments.  Dr. Forsythe has been doing this therapy for years and is a leader in this field.  His IPT Program was featured in Suzanne Somers’ book, Knockout, about alternative ways to kill cancer, and there are many cancer-free success stories attributed to his clinic.  On Dr. Forsythe’s website,  https://www.DrForsythe.com , he calls the procedure LDIPT, for Low-Dose Insulin Potentiated Therapy.   LAURA NEEDS YOUR HELP NOW.        Insulin Potentiation Therapy is not covered by Laura’s insurance, Anthem BC/BS, even though it costs a fraction of the cost of full-blown chemotherapy treatments and the results are equal if not better. We had expected to use the equity in our house for IPT treatment if/when Laura’s cancer returned.  Unfortunately that is no longer an option. Earlier this year, Laura was shocked when her employer of 27 years unexpectedly eliminated her job.  They offered her severance pay and assured her that she would not be financially compromised because they would show her as “employed for mortgage or loan purposes”. However, we soon discovered that her paychecks are unnecessarily printed with the word SEVERANCE, disqualifying her for a loan or access to home equity. We feel trapped by this, as we want to leave for Nevada immediately, before the cancer causes new damage.        The Forsythe Cancer Clinic, like other alternative clinics, requires patients to pay cash for services as they are received.  The average 3-week treatment, plus hotel and travel expenses, typically ranges between $40K - $50K.  We realize this is a huge amount to ask for but, in return for your support, we will provide regular updates on our expenses and experience.  Laura feels she has been blessed with good information in treating her cancer thus far, and she wants to openly share information about her IPT experience with others who are also without traditional or comforting options.        We think IPT is logical, based on specific and proven cancer-killing agents, and relatively trouble-free for the patient.  If this is as good as it appears to be, we want others to find it or demand development of comparable targeted low-dose treatments for cancer and other diseases. We will update this campaign with tales from the road, and invite you all to come along, witness and experience our journey.        Our bags are packed. We just need the funds to go.  Thank you all for your love, prayers, support and donations!     Laura and Diana at the Minnesota State Fair, 2007.MAY YOU ALL KNOW LOVE, HEALTH & HAPPINESS!",352d6883409cd7234eeca26599abeb21,104,0.50195,120.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Her smile, cheer, and laughter is contagious everywhere she goes. She has always been right there for me whenever I needed her without hesitation. Throughout all of my life, I’ve seen her devote her heart and soul to her work and family. Duvraska (nicknamed Duvi by friends and family) has always been a fighter. Sometimes I even think she works too hard because she doesn’t leave enough time in the day for herself to relax. She’s always putting me first and her sacrifices have gotten us to where we are today. For the last 10 years, my mom has been battling with Multiple Sclerosis. MS is a condition that disrupts the patient's central nervous system and affects the flow of information from the brain to the rest of the body. Now, Duvraska and her family is faced with another challenge to beat.Unfortunately, with this recent diagnosis of breast cancer, the circumstances have changed. As of right now, the gravity of the tumor will not require her to go into chemotherapy, but she will need various surgeries to eliminate the cancer before it gets any bigger. These surgeries are scheduled to start in about a week and end around March. As a single mother, my mom is the only source of income in our household and the cost of the surgeries and treatment is only a part of the problem. My mom won’t be able to work for weeks after a surgery because she needs to rest and recover. That’s why I decided to start this campaign in order to compensate for the weeks (maybe months) that she won’t be receiving a paycheck but will still be expected to pay for medical bills,  house expenses, food, etc. Cancer doesn’t have to be all bad news though. Which is why I am simply asking for any, and I mean any sort of support while we’re on this journey. We are open to any sort of aid. I just want to make my mom’s road to recovery easier for her like she’s made my life easier through her hard work. If we can raise enough money to cover her expenses, that’ll be one less thing she has to worry about. I’m not demanding money from anyone here, (although if you’re still here, then you must be interested in this cause and I really can’t thank you enough for at least reading this far). Nevertheless, I know that everyone has very busy lives and their own worries and maybe some people just can’t afford donating right now, but please spread the word.  I am just asking for something as simple as sharing this page/link with your friends and family because that’s enough for me and I am sure my mom, Duvraska, would be very grateful as well...Thank you for taking this time out of your day.

One month later, they learned it was soft-tissue Sarcoma. After two weeks of tests and hospital visits, they were told it had also spread to his lungs. Odin has an aggressive stage four cancer and he’s going to fight it.Two year olds aren’t supposed to have cancer. They are supposed to laugh, learn and feel love. Odin is the kind of kid that captures your heart as soon as you meet him. He is always laughing and playing. You would never have know  such a monsterous disease was growing inside him. Treatments are about to start and include the surgical removal of the orange-sized lump followed by many rounds of chemo and radiation. They are in for a long and virtuous fight.Odin’s parents are caring people who have devoted their lives to helping others. They are struggling with this new terrifying reality and have to put aside their professional careers as they make their way through the treatments over the  coming months. François and Reesa are much better at helping others than asking for help. The funds will help cover lost revenue and allow the parents to spend as much time with Odin as they can.While we are all focused on a positive outcome, we are asking and appreciate help in getting us there.

Suite à deux semaines de tests et de visites à l’hôpital, on leur a dit que le cancer s’était aussi propagé dans les poumons.  Odin lutte contre un cancer agressif au stade quatre, qu’il va combattre avec une équipe de tonnerre qui le soutient!Les bambins de cet âge ne devraient pas faire face à de telles épreuves.  Ils sont censés rire, découvrir et aimer.  Odin a une personnalité attachante, enjouée, qui nous séduit dès qu’on le rencontre. Il a un rire communicatif et beaucoup d’énergie! On ne devinerait jamais qu’une maladie monstrueuse a envahi son corps. Les traitements commencent, notamment l’ablation de la masse d’une grosseur d’une orange suivi par plusieurs rondes de chimio et de radio thérapie. La bataille sera longue et ardue.Les parents d’Odin sont des personnes qui ont choisi de consacrer leur vies à aider les autres. En tant que travailleurs autonomes, François et Reesa devront subir une perte de revenus afin d’être présents et d’accompagner leur fils à travers cette nouvelle réalité. Ils ont beaucoup plus de facilité à offrir de l’aide qu’à en demander. Les fonds amassés aideront la famille à se tenir ensemble pour faire face aux 43 semaines de traitement qui les attendent.Nous espérons tous un dénouement positif.  Nous sommes reconnaissants de tout don, si minime soit-il.

Two weeks of no school and presents soon to be had, Savanna just didn’t seem quite herself.   Walking up the stairs from our basement made her heart race, and she would constantly say she was tired.  The first snowfall left our backyard a sledding haven, only to be enjoyed for a brief time because she “just felt exhausted”.   Sleeping in went from 10am to noon, with troubles waking her up. I figured it’s Christmas break, let her enjoy some rest. The New Year came and passed, and the kids returned to school. Within the first week of returning, I received a call from the school nurse. She wanted to inform me of an incident Savanna had during her first hour P.E.  She became weak and dizzy, lightheaded and nauseous. The nurse said she checked her blood pressure and it appeared low.  She just wanted me to know.  During the next week Savanna complained of a couple of headaches and again, being tired.  Around this time she brought to my attention hundreds of little red pin-dots from the tops of her feet and covering her legs up to her knees.  My thoughts were maybe something viral and she’s fighting an infection. I got another call from the nurse at school about a week from the last episode.  Again, Savanna was near passing out during P.E.  She suggested, and I concurred, a pediatrician visit was needed. I called the pediatrician’s office, indicating her symptoms of headaches, dizziness, nausea, rapid heart racing and a rash.  On January 15th, Savanna’s pediatrician examined her.   He explains to us the dizziness and heart rate and low blood pressure comes from orthostatic hypotension. Tells us to change her diet in the mornings, drink plenty more water, and carry on.  As he is about to wrap up the visit, I asked him what about the rash.  He proceeded to lift her pants to inspect her legs, and saw the hundreds of little red dots covering them. He indicated the medical term for this as Petechiae. He says it comes from straining.  I told him no injuries have occurred and found it odd to be on both of her legs.  He said we will keep an eye on it and not to search out the google doctor because I’ll be worried sick.  Our visit was over. Throughout the next week we tried to change her breakfast diet a little, bought her a Tervis water bottle, and went about life. Another call from the school nurse on January 24th left me calling the pediatrician and stating my concerns as well as the school nurse’s,  about the dismissed rash and other continued symptoms. I received a call back from the pediatrician’s office, and was told that the doctor has ordered an EKG to be done on Savanna, then we will go from there. No appointment or urgency, just walk into the hospital when you are able, and once they have the results they will follow up. The next 48 hours were a series of events that took place that will make an unbeliever rethink their doubts about divine intervention. I was to be boarding a plane for takeoff to Florida on Friday, January 25th, 8:15am. In the early hours of this morning, I came down with a vile bout of a stomach bug, vomiting and such, and unable to move out of bed to get ready for my flight.  My trip was cancelled.  The kids felt so terribly for me, as they knew I was looking forward to this trip for sometime.  I assured them I wasn’t disappointed, and would just  spend the weekend with them since I didn’t have to work. I noticed Savanna not feeling particularly well. She was warm with a fever and complained of her throat hurting.  I was glad that I had been unable to fly, and to be home with her knowing she was now sick.  Saturday morning came around and we all got to enjoy the rarity of sleeping in.  By 10:30, we were all awake with the exception of Savanna.  I went to check on her and she felt hot, and complained of an even worse sore throat.  My other children and I continued on with our Saturday morning chores.  Around 1pm I decided to check her fever.  It was 102.5°.   Savanna, her sister, and I entered Anderson emergency room at the recommendation from our insurance, around 4:30. They swabbed her for the suspected strep throat I was sure she had. We waited patiently for the ER pediatrician to come in.  When he did, he informs us the strep culture came back negative.  Weird, I thought.  He proceeds to examine her.  Her spleen was enlarged, she had a heart murmur, and appeared anemic. He asked if I’ve heard this before about the heart murmur.  I told him no, and that her pediatrician said nothing of the sort 10 days prior. He continues to order lab work and other tests.  The whole works. I’m thankful he’s being thorough while we are there.  About an hour passed and the pediatrician returned. His grim look was no different than at our introduction.  He sits down on the swivel stool and says he has bad news.  With my daughters and myself all ears, his next sentence is one I have never imagined would be spoken to me.  It looks like leukemia. With uncontrollable shaking and the sound of Savanna’s voice in the background repeating “am I going to die”, all I could think was “please, God, give me the words to say to her to bring her peace and comfort, and assure her she has a long life to live”.  It is incomprehensible how one will respond to a traumatic turn of events. Only until it stabs you in the heart, will you know you’re true strengths and weaknesses. Savanna is a fighter.  She always has been, and I’m pretty positive always will be.  She fights with me. She fights with her twin brother.  She fights with her little sister.  Sometimes she fights with her friends.  She is fighting this cancer to the end.  And she will win. Backstory: Three years ago to this past month of January, our family had been displaced.  What my children knew as the perfect family life was stripped from them in an instant. Addiction took their father out of our lives, losing our home, our vehicles,  our dear neighbors and friends, and everything we knew as our normal.   Moving back to my home state to be helped by my family meant leaving their friends, starting a new school, and trying to start life over again, but without their father.  Multiple attempts of his recovery and relapse have left my children fully reliant upon me.  I wouldn’t have it otherwise.  I’ve stepped away from my employment for the time being, to be by her bedside night and day. With the help of dear family and friends, we are fighting this battle with her. I am setting up relief funds for her and her up-and-coming medical expenses, as well as travel expenses, child care, food, and living assistance, as I am hers and her 2 siblings’ sole provider and care taker during this endeavor. Help us in supporting Savanna along the way with this journey to heal her and help reach our goal, 2B CANCER FREE!!! We’ve come too far to let this little thing called cancer stand in our way. We’ve initiated this fund for the sake of my daughter’s recently diagnosed leukemia, as well as our family’s wellbeing.   We are at the infant stages of this process known as chemotherapy.

In july 2017 I did comprehensive PET scan that showed me cancer-free. In March  2018 I started having strange bone pains along with gastrointestinal issues, that I was focusing on. In summer 2018 everything got worse, I had to quit my job after few months and significantly lost weight, moving around was an issue, I was fatigued, I made it to ER few times with low-grade fever but nobody could determine what is going on, sending me home with gastrointestinal diagnosis’s. Finally, on November 25, 2018 I went to ER and they were able to see Cancer  lesions on my spine (along with fracture on spine and neck), I was happy I finally got the diagnosis. After many comprehensive tests it showed I have cancer in my hips, pelvic bone, femurs, ribs, neck, liver, and a few other soft tissues. It is not curable but treatable and I started on new pioneer targeted chemotherapy drug Kisqali that in a month it eliminated pretty much all my bone pains. I was doing great. But I had to go to radiation, to treat my neck and spine fractures before it broke and I was paralyzed. My insurance approved only 10 radiation treatment vs. 14-20. So, each time I was getting more radiation and it made me very sick.  I lost my voice because radiation burned esophagus and throat, I was nauseous and after 4 treatments passed out in Radiation doctor’s office. I had to be transported to nearby hospital by firefighters where I stayed the day. Later we got enormous bill for the 5 minutes of my Firetruck ride. Because I was weak and couldn’t eat I was sent to a whole day infusion procedure where they fed my body through IV. The big mistake on doctor’s part was that radiation affects white cell production and lowers it. And along with that my oncologist made the decision to continue on chemotherapy drug which also made white cells low. This state is called neutropenia.Last Wednesday I suddenly stopped walking. I thought it was because I was fatigued. On Friday I started having neutropenic fever and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors found multiple bacteria in my blood which is called sepsis. I was put on heavy antibiotics treatment plan, people had to be fully dressed in protective clothing to see me. So, my white cells count went up during my 6-day stay at the hospital, and I’m still at the hospital, because they are checking bacteria in my blood.  After my discharge I will have to have several weeks of IV infusions at home. Every bad event brings great things - I met an amazing caring oncologist that took over my case.I never thought I would be this way. I never thought I would have to learn to walk again. Few of you, my kind friends, offered financial assistance and insisted on this page and we considered. Medical bills pile up quickly and I’m not coming back to work for few months, so your money will really help with our medical expenses. Don’t feel obligated but please share on social media. Thank you everybody.

I was waitressing there, and it was my first weekend working when we met. I remember standing at the soda machine and the back door suddenly opens, letting in a rush of sunlight. Don walks in past me wearing a black short sleeve shirt and khaki shorts with the sun illuminating his long dreadlocked hair tied up in a bun. “Hi, I’m Don, the barback.” Those are the first words he ever said to me. He smiled a smile that is burned in my brain for eternity. His eyes were blue as oceans and I swear his eyelashes moved in slow motion when he blinked. I’ll never forget it, that first time I saw him. I will also never forget the air leaving my lungs as he spoke to me, and my inability to inhale more air in afterward to respond to him at all because I was so enamored by him. My first thought after he walked out of the room was, “if that is not my next boyfriend I swear to god I’m going to be really pissed.” Fast forward through a lot of mimosas, unsolicited medical advice, and late night conversations. We fell in love…seamlessly. Effortlessly. It was so simple. I picked him and he picked me.  We met, and then did not spend more than a day apart after that. It felt like we fit perfectly, like the opposite pieces of those best-friend broken heart necklaces. We were both broken people that have lived through so much more life and trauma than majority of others our age. We found peace and healing in each other, and it grew into a really beautiful love. ￼￼￼￼￼￼But Don has cancer...again...for the third time now.Don was first diagnosed with rare appendix cancer in 2015:￼￼Don went into the emergency room with severe stomach pain that felt like appendicitis, but when the surgeon went to remove Don’s appendix he found it to be so full of cancer it had nearly burst. This was obviously a shock for him, his friends, and family. Don endured brutal chemotherapy for months after having his appendix and a section of his colon surgically removed. The chemo made him experience a loss of his sense of taste, painful tingling in his hands and feet, made it feel like his lungs were collapsing when he breathed in or drank anything cold, and so many more awful things. Because this cancer is so rare, he had to drive hours into Illinois to be treated by a gastrointestinal oncology specialist who knew how to treat this specific kind of cancer. Only about 1000 people per year have appendix cancer (compare that to breast cancer with >200k new cases per year). Don was absolutely thrilled when he was declared cancer-free after completing the absolute hell that was his chemotherapy, a little less than a year after he was diagnosed:￼￼But, because life really, really sucks sometimes, Don’s cancer returned about one year after therapy. He started feeling pain around the area where his appendix was and went to the oncologist to get it checked out. The doctors told him it was most likely ""scar tissue"" or lingering pain from the surgery. As the pain got worse and worse, Don went back a third time and told them he knew for a fact it was not ""scar tissue"". When Don was finally able to get a CT scan, the doctors discovered a large tumor in his abdominal wall. The surgeon removed the tumor, but he also had to remove a large section of his abdominal muscles as well. This was a very painful procedure and healing process for Don:￼￼(I love how he's still smiling. Seriously, who smiles like that after getting a chunk of their torso cut out with two drains hanging out of their side??)Fortunately, he was declared cancer free again in the beginning of 2018. He was scheduled to have follow-up CT scans every few months to ensure no cancer returned. In August 2018, Don went in for a routine CT scan that showed his lungs were peppered with small lesions that looked like cancer. He had absolutely no symptoms. We waited two horrible weeks for Don to have a biopsy and then two additional horrible weeks for the biopsy results. Doctors confirmed our worst nightmare and he does in fact now have stage IV appendix cancer. Life really, really, really sucks sometimes. Lung tumors are often removed surgically, but he is not eligible for surgery because the doctors will only operate with three or less tumors in his lungs. Don has at least ten tumors in his lungs right now. We consulted with appendix cancer experts all over the country via email and phone (MD Anderson, Sloan Kettering, UChicago, and more) and they all agreed that a grueling chemotherapy regimen is the only course of action. Don’s form of appendix cancer is rare to begin with, but these experts told us there are only a few cases of this subtype of cancer spreading to the lungs how Don’s has. We are in uncharted territory. The doctors don’t know what kind of results to expect. All we have been told is basically that the chemo will either kill the tumors or it won’t. A mutational analysis revealed Don has mutations that make his cancer fairly resistant to chemo in general, which is not what anyone wants to hear. Even if the tumors completely disappear, Don will still have to endure maintenance chemo for the rest of his life because the risk of his cancer returning will always be very high. He will be on a different chemo regimen this time than he was before, and he is heartbroken about losing his hair (those dreadlocks are 3+ years in the making!) He is scheduled to start treatment on January 8, 2019. Don obviously will not be able to work a regular job while these medications wreak havoc on his body, and he will need support from his family and friends. Don would want everyone to believe that he is positive and hopeful and strong and invincible all the time and that this cancer is nothing but the next hurdle in life. But that isn’t entirely true. Yes, Don absolutely has the most beautiful outlook on life and serves as an inspiration to everyone that meets him and hears his story. Don is a shining light and his presence can uplift the spirits of everyone he is around. Many people dealt the hand he has end up turning bitter and blaming the world and everyone in it for their misfortune. Don isn’t like that at all.This is Don's baseball team. He is holding his homerun ball he hit that day, when his team won the men's league championship. Did I mention he was currently undergoing chemotherapy with a port implanted in his body when this photo was taken? (that's Don for you)￼￼We are remaining positive, but we are also really f***ing scared. I have screamed into my pillow in the middle of countless nights crying so hard that my eyes swell shut and the blood vessels in my eyelids burst. The fear of losing Don sometimes consumes me, like a swarm of piranhas slowly tearing away the flesh from my body. I often feel like a hollow shell of a human being walking around in public amongst all these people who are experiencing normal days in their normal lives upset about the weather or something equally as minuscule while I contemplate the fact that the man I am holding hands with has tumors growing all over his lungs. Because I have felt these things, because I have thought these thoughts, because I have been consumed by this...I know he has too. After Don worked his last shift at Mitchell’s a few weeks ago, I held him in the front seat of my car as he screamed into my hoodie, his body shaking while he cried out all the pain in his heart. The day the lung CT scan results came back, we cried relentlessly together, clutching each other on his couch, his tears drenching the back of my shirt and my tears drenching the sleeve of his. We have fallen asleep next to each other in the middle of the day, absolutely exhausted from the amount of tears our bodies expelled. We cry less now than we did when we first found out. Neither of us have found any good way to describe what we are feeling. Don is so strong. I am trying to be strong. We are both terrified. We ran away to Traverse City, MI for four days before chemo started so we could escape the stresses of life and try to get our shit together before it all hit the fan (we clearly had a lot of fun):￼￼Obviously, Don has a long road ahead of him. He's already beat cancer twice. He's been dealt the blow that he has cancer for the third time at the age of only 29. He's been through more than any human should have to go through. However, he remains incredibly positive and wants to fight this. Anyone that knows Don would agree that he is the kindest and happiest person on this planet. He deserves so much more than what he's been dealt in this life so far. He has the absolute most incredible group of friends that ever existed in the world history of friend groups ever:￼￼The orange shirts (Appendix cancer color) were a surprise to Don this day, at their annual Friendsgiving. Seriously, the best friends EVER, I told you.Every dollar donated here will go to Don. Don wanted donations deposited into my personal bank account and transferred to him at the end of the fundraiser. Even though our world has been turned upside down, the world as a whole does not stop turning when you get cancer. Bills still come to your doorstep. Expenses still occur. Life still happens. Don will most likely never be able to stop chemo to start working again. Don will still receive bills for his mortgage, electricity, cellphone, internet, gas to get to and from Goshen Cancer Center (~1.5 hour drive each way) for every chemo infusion, and medical bills while he's fighting cancer. Every single donation will help Don be able to focus on healing instead of his finances. Don will have complete control over the donations to spend where he sees best fit. (I cannot guarantee he will not buy a video game or two with the fundraising, especially when the new MLB game comes out):￼￼(I also cannot guarantee he won't take his mom out to lunch with the donation money because he loves doing that. Plus, she deserves it because she is a great mom. She has been Don's rock throughout this entire process):￼￼We cannot thank you enough for helping in aiding in any healing to the man who has healed me and brings joy into anyone’s life he comes in contact with. As we try to get by during this excruciatingly difficult time, we ask for your help…. Hoping that maybe, just maybe, we might get by with a little help from our friends….",bf61f583c94e109008e4d72054ca2aac,95,0.4065,60.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

She begins chemotherapy for a second time next week (Feb. 2019), and she will need our help. Thanks to everyone's donations last year ($11,555), we were able to cover her medical bills (which included four trips to MD Anderson's emergency room).Maria is now 68-years-old and only works part-time. Please help her by donating to help cover her costly medical bills.Initially, I had hoped to raise funds for her medical bills and rebuild her house (several people promised to help with her house last year, but failed to do so). She currently rents an apartment, but it is located on the third floor and it will be extremely difficult for her to climb stairs once chemotherapy once again weakens her body.The most important thing now is to help lift the financial burden as she wages the fight of her life for a second time. Please, please donate -- and spread the word -- so, together, we may help our dear friend, Maria Jimenez.For over five decades, Maria has selflessly given her life in service to our community, and she needs our help to cover medical and living expenses. Her home is also in badly need of repairs with no electricity (wiring bad), mold, and an unsustainable structure, so she is forced to rent a third-floor apartment. A construction company's inspection report found her house unstable, warning the walls would collapse with the weight of a new roof. A complete tear-down and rebuild is needed.Many may be unaware that Maria was highly instrumental in advocating with ARCA (a group she helped to found) for the successful legalization of over 350,000 late amnesty cases related to President Reagan's 1986 IRCA law.

You've been asking how you can help so it’s only fair that you know the whole story.On December 4, 2018 our family received news that our father, Tony, was diagnosed with stage 4-A squamous cell carcinoma. The six centimeter tumor was positioned underneath his tongue, resting against his jawbone, inhibiting his ability to speak and eat. Thankfully, the team at the University of Kansas Health System was able to get him scheduled for surgery on December 28. Dr. Andres Bur and his team worked flawlessly for eight hours, removing two-thirds of his tongue (glossectomy), nearly all of his jaw (mandiblectomy), and 61 lymph nodes from his neck. Dad’s reconstructive surgery is called a free flap where they take a piece of his fibula, calf muscle, and skin from his left leg to rebuild a new jaw and floor of his mouth. Dad had top dentures before surgery and with the removal of his jaw, he was left with no teeth. Dad now has to re-learn how to breathe, swallow, and talk with a trach tube which will take months of speech therapy. Effective communication has been one of the biggest challenges.Shortly after surgery, we met with a kidney specialist and found out that Dad has a second, separate type of cancer that is not related to the cancer in his mouth. The renal cell carcinoma is slow growing but is currently the size of a golf ball. It is large enough that he will need to have his entire right kidney removed. Thankfully, he has another kidney that is functioning properly. Dad will start radiation and chemotherapy in the next week or so to kill off the remaining microscopic cancer cells in his head and neck that the doctors were unable to remove with surgery. Radiation will be Monday through Friday. Chemotherapy will be once a week. Both treatments are expected to go for six to seven weeks. The type of chemotherapy Dad has been prescribed can cause significant damage to the kidneys so all of the oncologists have agreed to wait until after Dad is done with radiation and chemo to proceed with the kidney removal.As if that wasn’t enough to endure, on Saturday, February 2, 2019, our family received a phone call that Dad’s place of business had caught fire. Dad has worked as an upholsterer and a private business owner of Veteran’s Upholstery for more than 30 years. We were very fortunate that no one was injured but everything inside is a total loss, including current customers’ furniture that was waiting to get re-upholstered. The building itself is covered by insurance, however, the contents within are not. Thousands of dollars’ worth of materials and equipment are unsalvageable. With Dad’s recent cancer diagnosis, he has been unable to work since his surgery date, leaving Mom to be the sole income earner, working countless hours of overtime to make up the difference.The start of the year brought on a new annual healthcare deductible and billing cycle. Medical costs continue to grow well beyond initial estimates. Daily expenses include formula tube feedings, wound care, and home health visits. Monthly expenses include mortgage payment, utilities, car payments, rent and utilities for the shop, etc. Future expenses will include several sets of new dentures as his jaw continues to heal, shop restoration, and reimbursing clients for value of items lost.Thank you to everyone who has prayed and continue to do so. Thank you for any and all future contributions. We’ll keep you all posted on this ongoing journey as Dad focuses on getting healthier and we start to rebuild his livelihood.  --The Nguyen Family",672eb6e877b6954b971869de15c635ff,29,0.37144,7.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I also love my career as a nurse. Spending so much time caring for other people, you rarely think about yourself. One day I found a large lump in my breast that did not hurt, was not round, and did not have a ""rubbery"" feeling to it. So being a nurse knowing those are not good signs, what do I do? I ignore it for awhile, telling myself it will go away, I mean I'm only 37, never had a mammogram what was there to worry about? Finally I sucked it up got checked and could read the doctors faces and I knew it wasn't good. A week later the biopsy results came back and I was ready to laugh at myself for worrying even a little. Instead, it was as if someone took a chair and knocked my legs out from underneath me. It was positive for invasive ductual carcinoma with lymphvascular invasion...fancy way of saying I have an aggressive form of breast cancer. My daughters were all I could think about. I underwent my first surgery 2 weeks later, no good news there; stage 3 with lymph node involvement, and they had found more cancer, I had to go back in for 2 more surgeries. More tests came back as well and again more bad news. I was told I will have to undergo a minimum of 1 year of intense chemo, and a complex double mastectomy after that. I also had to leave my job, and somehow figure out a way to care for my children. Having lost both my parents already, my head was spinning trying to figure out how I'm going to do all of this.

My name is Christina Greene.  I’m raising money for my little Sister Amanda Gorrill. She has very recently been diagnosed with Cancer. Anaplastic Carcinoma. This is a STAGE 4, RARE, AGGRESSIVE form of Thyroid Cancer. This type of mutation affects Less Than 2% of all those who suffer through Thyroid Cancer.      Often with a grim prognosis.The doctors words were “this cancer can literally change in front of your eyes.” The road to remission is going to be a long, agonizing one. This will consist of possible fertility treatment, then extensive Chemo and Radiation. My sister is only 31. Her husband Andy and her have been together for 16 years. They are the true definition of High School Sweethearts. They just bought their first house 3 months ago after recovering from financial hardships due to circumstances beyond their control. Until last Tuesday, all they were focusing on was starting a family. Insurance these days is terrible as we all know and the coverage offered for her treatment is Minimal to say the least. Amanda is a Nanny, so her insurance is not paid for by an employer which is also a huge expense. Her battle has already begun with scans, biopsies, blood tests, travel and more scans. Surgery and treatment are 2 hours away from home and sometimes the drive is going to be unbearable. The calls for collections have already stared rolling in. Hospital room fees, anesthesia, surgeon, meds, treatment, gas and motel bills will add up immensely. She has taken a leave of absence from work with no pay, with no way of knowing if she will be able to return. These are good, hard working people who have always lived a modest lifestyle full of love. I’m kindly reaching out to raise money to help my Sister and Brother in Law in this devastating time. Your donations will directly go towards medical bills and travel expenses. So their focus can be on her recovery. She’s my best friend and he quite possibly is the sweetest, most loving human being I’ve ever crossed paths with. I want to see them have the chance to enjoy the rest of their lives Together.

He is also an amazing teacher who inspires his students to become better players, performers, and more importantly better people. We are sharing KEV’s story and asking for your help because ever mounting  bills should not be what keeps him from a full and hearty return to music, his students, his community-building and his life. This go fund me account will help assure that KEV will be able to afford the insurance needed to treat his illness, and pay any additional medical expenses, rent, and other needs while he is recovering.As some of you know in 2016 KEV was diagnosed with colon cancer and had emergency surgery to save his life. During the surgery they removed a tumor blocking his intestines and 14 inches of colon. Unfortunately, this was followed by a massive infection leading to weeks of hospitalization and mounting expenses.It was a long road to recovery. Months of chemotherapy had devastating side effects, preventing him from playing the guitar or ukulele, and from making a living. Just as he was getting on his feet the doctors found tumors and infection in his liver, and he had another surgery to remove a third of his liver. Recovery from these two surgeries has been a huge set back. Last year he suffered another setback when his retina detached leading to two additional surgeries and more time out of work. He had just begun rebuilding his life and career for the third time only to find out last month that he once again has colon cancer.      Awesome students leaning and having fun.KEV’s surgery is scheduled for February 6. After surgery we will know more about his cancer, recovery, and further treatment. Recovery and additional chemotherapy could take months, and for someone who is self-employed, that is devastating.Anything you can give will help KEV return to his life, his career, to all his Tikis, to his students who miss him greatly, and to making music for everyone to enjoy.Kev and his Tikis at Comic-ConFrom Kev (in his own words to his amazing Tikis):“SNEAKY TIKI WILL GO ON! You need to keep your Tiki fun skills in shape until I return.  I have to postpone all lessons, classes, gigs, and all-you-can-eat buffets for a little while. We won’t know how long recovery will be until after the surgery. I will miss my Sea Turtles, and all my Tikis and students. I consider myself very lucky to have you all in my life and to be a small part of yours. I truly love you all, except for that one weird person….I plan on staying above dirt… so don’t think you can get rid of me that easy.I did really great in my 2 major practice surgeries, and my 2 practice Chemotherapy gigs.  Plus, I had two BONUS eye surgeries this year too… I am warmed up and ready to kick cancers butt…. again.

Amy had been experiencing shortness of breath and lack of energy for some time. The night before the 17th was especially bad with pain on her left side and back, so bad she couldn’t sleep and ended up on the couch. Thinking she had some kind of virus, she went to urgent care expecting to get some antibiotics or some other kind of medication to fix the problem. There the doctor took her blood and did a chest ex ray and the result was nothing that they ever expected. She told Amy to call her husband and to go to the emergency room as soon as possible. There was a large mass on her lung and the doctor suspected cancer.She was admitted right away and started a myriad of tests. CT scans, MRI, blood tests and eventually a pet scan to determine how wide spread it was. She had detectable cancer in her lung, thigh, hip and kidney. The one on the thigh was growing quickly getting bigger and bulging out more every day. She grew incredibly weak and was experiencing extreme pain in the hospital. Her first radiation treatment was given to her that afternoon after a mapping scan while she was still in the hospital. The doctors decided they needed to be aggressive sooner than later. Amy had two radiation treatments while in the hospital stay that lasted eight days.During the eight day stay in the hospital, Amy’s family was hit with another blow. Scotts employer, Orchard Supply Hardware was going bankrupt and they were going to close the store. After 20 years of service he was going to be employed until October 20 2018. This was on top of Amy not being able to work either as an instructional aid for special needs children. Her unused sick pay she had accrued for almost 20 years would last for about 3 months and then she would be on half pay from the school district for 5 months. Having never gone through any of these circumstances before they knew they were going to be in a world of hurt but didn’t know how bad it was going to be until the Chemo started. Before Chemo, Scott was looking into different employment options with several to choose from. But after Chemo, it was clear that Scott needed to be home with Amy to care for all her needs and offer emotional support that nobody else could do. They have a son between them and Scott has three daughters from a previous marriage. All the kids are very supportive but live far away and it is up to Scott to take the lead in Amy’s care.The support they have received from friends and family far and near has been a humbling experience. They never knew would kind of impact Amy has made on so many people until something like this happens. The love, support and concern is unstoppable. The army of friends willing to take her to appointments is amazing and much appreciated. The offer of meals, blankets and pillows etc. has many of our immediate needs well handled. For this they say thank you with all of our hearts. But, that will not keep the lights on when they are both out of work nor pay for the copays that the insurance doesn’t pay. There may be some treatments in the future that the insurance may not pay at all and that is why they are asking for help. We have struggled on how much to ask and through talking with friends and figuring this will be a multi-year process. We have decided to ask for $80,000. To cover living and medical expenses for 2 or three years. It is a lot a money and they don’t take it lightly but there is also the fear that it may not be enough and we are hoping that is not the case.Please know we appreciate everything everyone has done and we thank you with all our heart.

The parents of three girls, ages 11, 8 and 10 months, they had been looking forward to a fun date night out. On the way to the Concert, Kurt experienced a scary episode where he nearly passed out, began to sweat profusely and turned ghostly white. He then blacked out and was unable to speak. Val immediately turned the car towards the nearest ER, Wake Med. Kurt had been experiencing some recent stomach pain but on this night, the pain suddenly became unbearable. Initially, the ER doctors thought that Kurt may have a blood clot based on blood work. Further testing revealed a devastating truth; Kurt was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer which had spread to his liver. Within days, Kurt underwent surgery to remove the tumor from his colon (this tumor had created an obstruction and a perforation which was the source of his extreme pain) and were able to remove it in its entirety. This alleviated much of the extreme pain he was in, however results of further testing confirmed that the cancer had already spread to Kurt’s liver. There are five tumors on the liver that are too large to make them operable at this time. The next step is chemotherapy to hopefully shrink the tumors on the liver so that the Dr. can operate. If they are able to shrink the tumors and operate, there is a chance that the cancer can be eradicated. At this time, Kurt is home and recovering from the very extensive surgery that removed the original tumor along with a portion of his colon. He will begin chemotherapy treatment by the beginning of September. The Dr. would like to begin aggressive treatment as soon as possible to hopefully shrink the tumors. Kurt is now on short term disability however the Dr. has advised that he will be unable to return to work; he is going to be out of work indefinitely. This diagnosis came completely out of the blue and has been an incredible shock to the Volkringer family. Even with insurance, medical bills and medication costs are astronomical. Valerie is a stay at home mom to her three children, and runs a pet sitting business. She is now also Kurt's primary caretaker and must take Kurt to the many Dr. visits and soon chemotherapy treatments. We are asking for help through this Go Fund Me page to raise $75-$100000 to help this family cope with the crippling medical costs of Kurt’s care in addition to his lost wages. We want to ensure that Kurt’s girls can continue to feel as secure as possible during this time of great need. Any small amount will make a difference. The Volkringers are an extremely giving family who are always there to lend a hand when someone is in need. Now the need is their own and though they would not ask themselves, the need is great.

Three year old Silas Dejarnette was taken to the hospital by his father, Kenneth Dejarnette. Silas was diagnosed with neuroblastoma on one of his kidneys. Neuroblastoma develops from nerve cells in the fetus called neuroblasts. As a fetus matures, the neuroblasts develop normally but sometimes they are abnormal, and turn out to be cancerous . Most children with neuroblastoma are diagnosed before age five, and it occurs more commonly in boys than girls. Each year more than eight hundred cases are diagnosed in the United States. This accounts for seven to ten percent of all childhood cancers. Just when we thought we had gotten the worst news we could imagine, the doctors came back with news that the cancer had metastasized.To be so young and not even have experienced life, yet hit with a diagnosis like this is truly disheartening. We as a family trust and believe in God, as a miracle worker. For we know that he is not only a way maker, but the ultimate doctor. It was the decision of Silas’ parents after consideration and advice from pediatric oncology specialists to proceed with chemotherapy. Our main goal is to give Silas the chance of survival, and a opportunity to live a long life. Since this diagnosis, Silas has continuously been in and out of the hospital receiving antibiotics, fluids for hydration, and chemotherapy. His parents have been by his side, and making that sacrifice have missed work to attend treatments. For those of you who don’t know Silas personally let me tell you some things about him. Silas is a bright and bubbly three year old fraternal twin to his brother Izaak. Silas, although only three is so full of life. He is smart, courageous, affectionate, adventurous, loving, and spiritual even at a young age. He is always smiling. His birthday is September 19, and he loves the color green. His favorite number is the number 1 and his favorite meal is meatloaf and potatoes. He loves to play sports especially soccer, basketball, baseball, and football. Silas will be four years old this coming September 2018. He would of started preschool this coming school year until this diagnosis. Unfortunately he will not attend preschool in order to continue chemotherapy, and finish out the duration of his treatments. Silas has faced his first few treatments of chemotherapy and endured them like a young and courageous fighter! He will need more chemotherapy, possibly radiation to the primary tumor, and potential surgery. We ask that you find it in your hearts to donate in order to help with medical expenses, but more importantly to continue the battle. All donations will be contributed to his medical expenses, and resources needed to help beat this diagnosis. #SilasSTRONG",e7ebb6cb9b06ad9e58f303c9a231446d,31,0.583,180.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

(Jaime's friends & family have created this gofund me for her.) This is Jaime’s 2nd battle with cancer in December of 2015. She was diagnosed with a triple negative breast cancer. She went through 8 rounds of chemo, a double mastectomy, many rounds of radiations, and had several lymph nodes removed. The doctors believed Jaime to be cancer free in August 2016.The cancer has come back and is more aggressive than ever.  The metastatic cancer is not curable. Jaime will fight this for the rest of her life. The metastatic breast cancer has spread to several places. Through many tests and procedures lately, they have determined that there are cancer lesions on the top of her spine, mid spine, low spine, right hip, pelvic bone, and several places in her liver.  Jaime is in extreme pain. The tumors are putting too much pressure on her bones which is causing them to weaken and fracture. She is also having muscle spasms, nerve pain, and nausea. Everyday tasks are very difficult for Jaime to complete. She is unable to work.  Her return to work is unknown. This is the hardest time in Jaime’s life and she needs the love, support, and prayers of her friends & family more than ever.  It is very important that we  help Jaime  focus all of her energy on keeping her mind and body strong.  This is not the time for her to worry about financial burdens. All money raised will go to support her everyday needs and medical expenses as she fights this battle. Insurance has been covering the majority of the medical expenses. We are having a difficult time getting them to cover the prescriptions. Insurance will not cover trials or alternative medicines. We will need to start raising money for these as well.  Her current treatment plan is as follows:- 12 weeks of Chemotherapy (Currently in week 3)- 10 treatments of radiation over 2 weeks (treatment #4 was today)- Blood transfusions (treatment #1 was today)- Bone strengthening medicine (treatment #1 today)- With positive results from the chemo and radiation, she will be able to start a trial in 9 weeks.It is incredibly important that Jaime stays positive and keeps her body healthy enough to be a candidate for the trail. Jaime has changed her diet to a large amount of protein, fruits & veggies, and complex carbs (No Processed foods).  We have set up a meal train for her. Hoping to provide 3 dinners per week or easy frozen meals that could be cooked in a crock pot or oven.The link to Jaime's meal train: https://mealtrain.com/z9m78yAny donations are greatly appreciated.

They've had their setbacks and health problems (my mom has had Multiple Sclerosis for 26 years and is disabled), but they feel very blessed and thankful for the life God has given them. My dad had never experienced real health problems, (though he's persevered with my mom through all her hard times and countless doctor and hospital visits over the years) until this past fall he was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer. After consulting at great length with his urologists and radiation oncologists, in particular his primary advisor Dr. Joseph Busch, the course of action that was decided on was the advanced technique of Focal Laser Ablation, a very precise MRI-guided laser treatment that completely destroys the tumor in the prostate without damage to the surrounding tissue or other vital organs. This technology has been used very successfully for years with many cancers and is the standard of care in other countries on the cutting edge of cancer research and care. As a sister therapy to the Laser Ablation, his excellent medical team also strongly recommended a course of therapeutic immune therapy vaccines, produced from actual cancer cells from tissue samples from his biopsy, which will allow the immune system to recognize and destroy these cancer cells anywhere in his body should some find their way out of the prostate. We (his family, friends and particularly his friends who have had or now have prostate cancer) are all very supportive and excited about the prognosis of this dynamic treatment plan, which will start the week of February 4th, 2019. Here's what the treatment plan looks like:-Feb. 4th 2019: The 1st of 4 immune therapy vaccines. This will involve a one-time trip to Grand Cayman, as that is where the headquarters of Perseus PCI (the company who makes the vaccine) is located. -Midway through the vaccines (which are spaced 1 month apart) he'll go to Houston on March 21st to receive the focal laser ablation from Dr. Ara Karamanian, who is very renowned in this field. The single great hurdle to overcome in his upcoming journey is of course cost; currently no insurance companies cover any of the charges for the focal laser ablation or immunotherapy (though the FDA is in the final approval stage for both).The projected out-of-pocket costs for both these treatments, along with travel and lodging, is over $39,000, and due to his modest income and my mom's disability and her constant medical needs, he's unable to come up with such a sum, especially in such a short time frame…and time is of the essence in dealing with this disease. My dad helps so many without ever asking for anything in return. We're praying that if he's had a positive impact on your life, or if you've experienced this ordeal or have been affected in some way by cancer, you might consider helping in some small way. We'd be forever grateful!-Anna Trakas",f836b43f6b389dfb56f24fef8ca1c699,15,0.26474358974358975,11.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

My first worry was how to face this situation. Thank God I’m in the United States, land of opportunity, and my doctors decided to perform two spine surgeries, during which I had a high risk of being paralyzed. I had two procedures on 08/28/2018 and 08/31/2018, in which they installed a titanium prosthesis in my back.After I recovered from both spine surgeries, during October of 2018, I received 10 sessions of radiotherapy and began chemotherapy.

Everything revolves around my treatment: time, money, and effort. This process has changed our lives. That is why I make this campaign, to ask for your help in this tough test. Help me live.

Her family has been preparing her for a stem cell transplant but unfortunately, she developed antibodies against all her viable donors. Simply put, with these antibodies, the chances of Aia rejecting the donor stem cells is higher than high, leading to graft failure, and could be potentially fatal.Unfortunately, her disease has accelerated to blast crisis this month, and she has been under hospital confinement ever since. Due to her state, she has been dependent on platelet and blood transfusions every other day; a single transfusion costs a very large sum of money. Her organs have been greatly affected and she is in constant excruciating pain due to the side effects of her current treatment. She has lost a lot of weight and her limbs are painfully thin (even though she may look pudgy because of the fluids). Right now, our goal is to get her out of blast crisis so her doctors can proceed to sorting out transplant issues as it still is the curative treatment for her condition.Despite all these, Aia remains as the hopeful, kind and brave girl that she is. Having a positive outlook, she would always muster the energy to smile in spite of the pain. We her cousins love her greatly, and so we took the initiative to set up a campaign here at GoFundMe.

Last August he was the youngest unicyclist to ride to the top of Pikes Peak. In January he was diagnosed with a highly aggressive brain cancer, Grade 3 anaplastic ependymoma. He is set to undergo his 2nd brain surgery to remove 2 more brain tumors (pea size) that have grown since his original surgery over Christmas break where surgeons removed a tumor the size of half an adult fist. Following surgery Daniel will undergo daily radiation treatments for 6 weeks and up to a lifetime of monitoring for cancer.Before discovering the tumor, Daniel had been having nausea, headaches and foot numbness on and off for about a month and a half. He had visited the ER around Thanksgiving, but more minor possible causes we're being ruled out first. Then while on a trip to Disneyland the week before Christmas, his left foot went palsy-like and he began stumbling and was unable to flex his foot. The family called his doctor and decided to go the ER.Daniel has great faith in God and comforts everyone saying ""God is in control."" He says he isn't worried (except about having a catheter again) he's just bummed he's not going to be able to do PE and sports like playing flag football and ultimate frisbee this spring. Some people say Daniel should be Mayor because he is so friendly and well spoken and isn't afraid to speak up even at public meetings about caring for his community's bike trails. He says why not aim for President. We believe Daniel will come through this ordeal and he can be cured of this cancer. but help is needed to cover the costs associated with his care.If you decide to donate to Daniel through Go Fund Me, the funds will  go to Daniel and to help with Daniel's ongoing care.

It turned out it was caused by a high grade anaplastic epedemoma cancer. It took a lot of testing by top hospitals, Barrows and St. Judes to determine pathology and a lot of time and before he could undergo radiation to ensure it wouldn't come back, two new pea-sized tumors appeared.

August 2015 was the first time she got cancer, a mass that had been growing inside her right lung for two years! When she found out, she didn't hesitate to get the cancer out of her. She told the doctors she wanted the entire lung removed and they did just that, removing the entire lung along with the tumor. A few days later she went into a coma for 10 days. There were times that we thought we lost her; but we didn't know she was in there fighting like hell, that she wasn’t giving up, that she was coming back to us. The doctors weren’t sure if she was going to make it out without some type of damage due to being on the ventilator for so long.

Olivia, who will turn 3 on July 10th, will undergo a major abdominal surgery to remove the tumor as well has her left kidney, which is completely engulfed by the cancer. Following surgery, she will have several months of chemo & radiation. Olivia has a 4 year old brother, Isaac, & a 10 year old sister, Emma. Kendra & Austin, who live in Aaronsburg, will be juggling Olivia’s treatments in Hershey as well as working full time & caring for their other children. I’ve started this page to ask for donations for this family as they embark on what is sure to be the most difficult thing they have ever faced. They will need extra money for gas, hotel rooms, childcare, & various medical expenses. Olivia is expected to make a full recovery but the journey to get there will be long, trying, & scary.

I have a wonderful family, a wife, two daughters, 3 and 6 years old, good job. Life was going great until suddenly in August of 2017, a terrible diagnosis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Stage 3 cancer was made which they deemed inoperable. Here also began, various medical tests, sleepless nights, bad thoughts which simply can’t get rid of. I think I am understood by those who have ever faced this ailment.Doctors at first said that I needed an operation to remove the pancreas that would prolong life, but needed to go through a couple of chemotherapy courses to reduce size of the tumors. At that point there were two of them. Two months of chemotherapy and the prognosis was positive in which the tumors reduced in size. After the prior session the Doctors recommended another two months of continuous chemotherapy which after unfortunately proved to not end up working.  The original size of the tumors returned and the physicians once again recommended further radiation and treatment. Even before I made it to my appointment I ended up in the ER with an abundance of pain. Tests, CT Scans were done in which they found that the tumors grew and spread into the liver attributing to Stage 4 Liver cancer as well. In my gut I felt that due to the intense radiation and chemotherapy instead of it helping in actuality it only increased the size of the tumors and helped them to spread. Until this point the doctors and I had hope that a surgery would be an option but at this given time that is no longer an option. The doctors pretty much gave up on my case and told me nothing else can be done and to wait it out. No one can really imagine how difficult it was the next step I had to go through when I had to inform my family of this prognosis, pretty much telling them I have limited amount of time to live. There are other treatments that give hope to patients like myself but of course require additional funding. In life, every person at one moment reaches a point in which they have to ask for help. I hoped that I had enough strength and money to fight this battle by myself but unfortunately my health is disintegrating and further funds are needed for new treatment that provided more hope for recovery. I have my wife and kids to live for and can’t imagine giving up on them.

I opted for a double mastectomy surgery in October of 2018, in which they found the entire right side compromised with cancerous cells, and removed tumors in the right armpit as well, and removed the left breast as well because of my high risk of reoccurrence. The doctors found through genetic testing that I carry a variant of the PALB2 and BRAC2 gene, both which of positive for, are indicators of high risk of breast, ovarian and other cancer. My doctors concluded that since I am so young with a very aggressive cancer and genetic indicators toward reoccurring risk, that it is in my best interest, medically, to perform a double mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation with follow-up treatment. For an aggressive cancer, aggressive treatment is needed and I want to be here, create a beautiful life in which I can continue sharing my talents with others, helping serve others, continuing to heal myself and the planet, and making this world a better place. Of course, I have more personal goals too like to raise a family, it would be simply amazing to have a family. I am currently just over half way through chemotherapy, of 6 sessions total spanning from December 2018 through March 2019, and after, I have scheduled radiation and a final reconstructive surgery. As an independent contractor for all my paid positions - as a yoga and meditation instructor, occasional model, and assistant to a screenwriter, I do not have the money and funds to do this alone.  I cannot afford to pay for all the supplements and alternative therapies in conjunction with conventional. Your generosity and kindness is deeply appreciated.  Thank you!

For Gary Batista, January 1st 2019, wouldn’t be a New Year’s Day like all of the others. Gary’s day started the same as the previous New Year’s had, prepping a brunch for the swearing in of new fire officers at the Keasbey Fire Department, where he has been a volunteer firefighter for over a decade.  He would leave just before the ceremony began so he could get ready to work his shift at the East Brunswick Rescue Squad as a Tour Chief. A few hours later Gary would be rushed from work to the hospital by his fellow EMTs after passing out. He was placed in isolation after a battery of tests would show his white blood cell count was very low, and he started running a fever. A few days later, Gary would receive the news that he was diagnosed with a form of bone marrow cancer. Gary Batista is a valued member of so many communities: from central Jersey, to Jersey City and beyond. What makes Gary so special, is that he has dedicated almost his whole life to serving others.  He entered the field of emergency services as a young cadet with the Hopelawn Rescue Squad in 1973. In 1976 Gary enlisted in the United States Marine Corps where he served his country for 3 years. He returned home in 1979, and again served his community by joining the Perth Amboy Fire Department as a volunteer fire fighter and Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) with the Perth Amboy Rescue Squad.  He would work as a New Jersey State Corrections officer for many years, as well as an EMT with Jersey City Emergency Medical Services. He returned home to Middlesex County in 2001 to work for Perth Amboy EMS (later Raritan Bay EMS), and join as a volunteer with the Keasbey Fire Department to serve with his brother Joseph Batista. After years of helping others, Gary is in need of OUR help. The treatment for his cancer, and his medical bills are a huge burden. In his time of need we are asking that you open your heart to helping Gary and his family. Gary has been instrumental in helping others and is the type of man who never asks for help. He will give 110% to any task he is confronted with even now at the age of 61.

She's been diagnosed with Stage 2A invasive ductal carcinoma, a very common, yet aggressive breast cancer. She is early stage, with a ER+, PR+, HER2- pathology (a favorable treatment profile). The doctors and Taylor have a good outlook, and she is looking forward to being on the other side of this, with new eyes full of wisdom! She does have a tough road ahead. She will begin with 5 months of ACT chemotherapy (the hard stuff) to shrink the tumor, then on to surgery, and 5-10 years of hormone therapy. She is a full-time biologist for our nearby coast and ocean, and while she will continue working part time, she will have to give up a lot of field work during treatment, as it requires handling dead animals.

Many days have its challenges! But we’re believing that in the midst of chaos, God is in complete control! No one ever wants to hear that their cancer has returned. In December 2013, my husband, Richard Pyfrom was diagnosed with Colorectal Cancer. With no family history and too young to imagine such a diagnosis (just 37 years of age), we were dealt this devastating news. Nevertheless, he underwent surgery which removed a large portion of his large intestine and cycles of chemotherapy with high doses of radiation that took a toll on his body and ultimately, affected his quality of life daily. Consequently, this was a battle he wished to never undergo again.To our dismay in October 2018, after experiencing severe itching, abdominal bloating and jaundice of the skin and eyes, he was admitted to the local hospital. After numerous tests, the CT scan had revealed that his cancer had returned and had spread aggressively to his liver. At age 41 - the youngest of all his siblings, Advanced Liver Metastasis: Stage 4 is his diagnosis. His liver is severely diseased and covered in tumors. The tumors have blocked his bile duct and gall bladder preventing drainage from his liver into the gall bladder and intestine. This has caused the liver to become enlarged and caused leakage of bile and bilirubin into his abdominal cavity and bloodstream, hence his intense systematic itching and jaundice. Lack of medical insurance and reliance on public healthcare system, led to weeks to schedule appointment dates for any sort of treatment. Surgery is NOT recommended because of the vast quantity of tumors. Radiation is also NOT a viable option because of the dosage given during his initial cancer treatment sessions. In the first week of December 2018, he was scheduled to do chemotherapy only to be told that his bilirubin levels were too high with no proposed advice or solution on how to lower those levels. Thus, if chemotherapy was given it would have poisoned his body. It was then recommended that he only be given two of the three intended drugs that would bypass his liver. However, this left doubt on the drugs’ effectiveness. Additionally, with his previous and ongoing experiences from chemotherapy, Richard has opted out of such treatments, leaving them as a last resort.With that being said, he has decided to adopt a non-toxic, holistic alternative treatment, All-Natural Alkaline Herbal Detox Cleansing Therapy. We, his family fully support this decision and hope that this method will ultimately heal him. Thus, improving his quality of life as the disease has caused jaundice, excessive fatigue and itching, extreme weight loss and bloating coupled with physical, emotional/mental, spiritual, and financial distress. Since he has begun this method we have already began to see promising results. He’s been more active and energized, feeling less bloating with reduced itching. Consequently, he had developed a refreshed and hopeful frame of mind. However, the treatments are costly! Alkaline herbal therapy medicines, Alkaline organic diet (food/drinks), miscellaneous supplies, ointments, pills totals approximately $2,500.00 of monthly expenses.However, to our dismay, his abdomen and lower extremities ballooned about a month ago. This posed great concern. Consequently, oncologists were contacted once again. He is scheduled to have an appointment on February 7th, 2019. This consultation may result in chemotherapy being the method of treatment, as his only option. However, we are unsure if he may be eligible for such treatment as previously mentioned. Additionally, the cost of the treatment is also unknown as it is based on the type of chemotherapy as well as the dosage. As this disease has prevented him from working and he was the breadwinner of our home, our family has been doing our endeavor best to cover costs, amongst other daily expenses, on our own. But we are now in desperate need of help to continue his journey to health and wellness. For those who know Richard they are aware of the incredibly sweet, humble, hardworking, and devoted father he is. His commitment to his family and his love for bowling and his bowling family (whom we are forever grateful for) is immeasurable.  Today, we kindly ask you to search your hearts and assist us in whatever manner you can with this endeavor. Whether you’re able to make a small donation or not, we do need your prayers! So, we ask too, that you continue to pray for Richard as he continues to battle this disease in search of having a better quality of life that he can spend with his wife, kids, family and friends. We are truly grateful for your support, continued prayers and words of encouragement.

You get smacked in the face with the big “C” word. At 31 years old, you don’t expect to hear those words.. “You have cancer”. Yet, that is exactly what has happened to our daughter, our sister, our aunt, our friend.  Amanda  Dix has been diagnosed with Stage IV Colon Cancer.  A disease that she will have the rest of her life!  A disease she is determined to face head on and fight!  There are two major financial issues that are impacting Amanda's life which she needs help with.A little background how this all came about...Amanda started having stomach pains back in September. In October the pain got so bad that she took herself to the hospital.  They did a CT scan and noticed “scaring” in her colon and they concluded it was probably colitis, but she needed to see a GI specialist. Unfortunately, she was not able to see a doctor before her move back to California in November.  Once back home she had to find a primary physician first and then get a referral for a GI specialist.  She finally got scheduled for a colonoscopy on January 8th.  Amanda started the prep for procedure and instead of having bowel activity she got terrible stomach pains and started vomiting.  Called her doctor and she was told to go straight to the emergency room.  They did another CT scan and decided to do a “mini” colonoscopy.  However, they could not get the probe past the area where the scaring was, so they scheduled her for surgery.  We were told it was most likely scar tissue, though there was a less than 3% chance it could be cancer.After,  3 1/2 hours of surgery the doctor came out and told us she removed 8 inches of Amanda’s colon and that she had stage IV colon cancer.  The cancer formed in her gland rather then from polyps, another rare form of cancer.  Additionally, the cancer had spread across her abdominal wall.  Needless to say, heartbreaking news!We are just starting to understand what’s all involved in fighting the beast! Lots of time, love, support and expense. And this is where we need your help.First,  Amanda took a leave of absence from her job in Seattle so she could move home to be close to her family.  Thankfully, she was able to enroll in her company's COBRA medical plan.The problem is she won't be able to work for several months, or longer and her insurance premium is about $550/month.

This is when Kinsley was sent to the hospital for what was thought to be a blood infection, and hours later found out it was Leukemia.

That route would also take having children away from her, her dream of having her own family.   Those of you who know Stacey know her heart and she is a healthy, athletic, happy, (dog)loving person.  Stacey has always believed in the strength of the human body and a more natural approach to life.  Stacey has decided to go a more nature-path way and work with a team  who believe in the science of your own body and healing it's biochemistry to fight the cancer and starve it out and then treat it with nutritional therapy, nutrients, antioxidants, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  A lot of research stands behind this approach and has had great success.  This would not damage her body long term, it would not harm her fertility, and it would leave a piece of her intact.  Going through cancer is a mental, emotional, and physical devastation.  You don't get a day off.  Day in and day out she is fighting and everyday she grows more and more fatigued.  Harsh fatigue is a major side effect of cancer, as you can imagine the fight her body has had for over a year, going from doctor to doctor.  Stacey needs your help to live.  The costs of this treatment aren't covered by insurance, and the fight to save her life will be major.  She needs to focus on herself and have a positive outlook, and stress free approach....see the irony there?  She has to be her biggest advocate.  And I'm sure you can imagine how hard that will be given the place she is in.  My sister is my best friend, and we have both generated a bond so strong, I need her in my life, we all need her.  Please share and share and share with all of your friends and family.  Thanks again everyone, it truly means the world to me! <3",e438f19e2bac9c0fa992c866308c8716,32,0.2,30.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is the eternity. Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope. We as a class love Rigo unconditionally, but I haven’t had the time to spend time with him as much as the other students did since the Fall of 2017. I transferred into the class on September 5th, 2018 of the fall semester. I can’t even begin to imagine how the others are feeling who have known him much longer than I have. Ever since I’ve enrolled in this class, nursing school has been much more fun and stress free. Whenever we need notes, help in class and need anyone to talk to on a personal and emotional level, he is always there for us. Rigo is the type of person that always puts on a smile and makes the classroom filled with joy and laughter. Surrounding ourselves around him always lifted our spirits high. Broken crayon’s still color, and no matter how heart broken he may be feeling right now, he never gives up without a fight. This fight isn’t easy, but he’s not alone in this because he has all of us and others that are deeply engraved within his heart. Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about learning how to dance in the rain. All too often, we forget about the patient's emotional fight while they're physically fighting their diagnosis, but cancer is a disease of the body, mind, and soul. Cancer may be a part of Rigo, but it does not define him. Cancer cannot cripple Rigo’s love, shatter his hope, corrode his faith, destroy his peace, destroy his friendships, suppress his memories, silence his courage and invade his soul. Rigo has an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills him with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people like Rigo do not just happen overnight. His diagnosis comes with huge expenses that is not limited to diet, tests/procedures, consultants, medication, follow ups and etc. This is a shock to all of us, but we are asking with a heavy heart to donate whatever you have to this fund as soon as possible. You know, chance does favor the prepared mind, and the more you know about it the more you will be able to understand what’s going to happen to you. I don’t think anybody should leave the doctor’s office after an examination or after an interview with the doctor with questions still on their mind. We want Rigo to get all the help he can get, but it can only start from us and everyone else that surrounds him by making a single gesture that will impact his life forever in a positive and meaningful way. Thank you for taking the time to visit our page and we all appreciate for everyone’s effort to give up a little bit of their time to help our amazing friend Rigo Asencio.

From then on she has faced sudden and related whirlwinds of subsequent events, and she needs our help.Before the immediate surgery to remove the tumor, and while staying in a local hotel and managing family situations at the same time, she was told she would only need 5-6 weeks radiation as post-operative treatment. At that time, already that seemed like a long period to be away from her home and life in Paris. In Paris, India had waiting for her upon her return:*a pending job offer to teach human rights*making plans to move in with a partner* her apartment and belongings*important pro bono groundbreaking legal projects she oversaw and brainstormed*urgent personal legal matters to tend to*AND her long-time dream to transition into making and selling her art, writing and jewelry in Paris.However, while she was still in the hospital bed in Sweden post-surgery, the surgeon informed her that the cancer had been found during surgery to have spread beyond the breast and into her sentinel and axillary lymph nodes, and that she would need, in addition the the treatment of radiation, 5 months of chemotherapy to start, as well as 5-10 years of pills/injections (hormone blockers as her breast cancer is hormone receptive) and monitoring. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------India's home, with her dreams and foundations to realize them, is Paris, and her medical team in Sweden is willing to help her transition her care to Paris, but this takes funds, effort, time and support. Since she has in the past few years been working hard as a dedicated and almost solely pro-bono human rights lawyer (expert in indigenous rights and additionally focused on root causes of domestic violence faced by immigrant women), while also lawyering her own cases and situations as an immigrant victim herself abroad (in turn rendered controversial for her work to speak out and in restorative methods), and doing the majority her work and advocacy out of her own pocket while becoming undiagnosably - until now! - increasing ill, India finds herself now in a financial and circumstantial bind with her sudden diagnosed medical situation and surrounding circumstances, as she also is not eligible for sick benefits or government assistance.India feels stranded and scared for her future; she wants, and has wanted this entire time, to get back to Paris to continue with the life she was on track with and for, to both pursue her opportunities of paying work in the ways she can and to be home, settled and relaxed in familiarity, surrounded by more extensive urban resources for her cancer needs, and forward-moving in her life, whole health and love. India is an independent soul, and it is NOT easy for her to ask for help, but several of us have offered to rally her communities to help out!As she put it: ""Breast cancer patients on treatments continue living their normal lives, but in this situation I'm stuck in a place I don't live and it's circumstantial, not medical. I am going to need everyone's help getting back, I can't do it alone. I'm used to being able to do everything alone, but I'm lost needing help gah!"" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Your donation can help India get herself back to her home in Paris and safely transitioned there with her ongoing medical needs. Examples of costs to get there and back on her feet and continuing healing are:* Translation of medical records in Sweden so that they can be sent to Paris for review prior and a return thus planned accordingly*Application fee for the Paris-based medical review and resulting ongoing treatment plan and care fees proposal *Fertility protection injections during chemotherapy*Genetic and blood tests not covered that aid in treatment decisions and analyses, including assessment of cancer status, potential for metabolizing (or not) of treatments including hormone blockers, assessment and monitoring of hormone levels, monitoring of treatment side effects (such as bone density/loss, uterine wall thickening, and other systems balance such as thyroid)*Costs to get India, her dog, and their things that are in Sweden from these months of medical urgency back to their home in Paris*Out-of-pocket medical expenses once in Paris in the months following return, especially while transitioning between national health care systems, for example: remaining treatments, both cancer- and treatment side-effects-related exams and scans and tests, check ups, monitoring of side effects of prescribed long term hormone blockers medicine, fertility checks and needs, providing of the long-term hormone blockers anti-cancer medicine, lymphedema aid- drainage massage, compression sleeves, natural remedies such as herbs, nutrition, essential oils, movement and manual body work, any urgent, sudden or ongoing care related to serious side effects of chemotherapy, radiation or hormone blockers *Emergencies and travel care coverage both en-route and for times when she is able to travel starting up work again*Trauma counseling and other reparative healing *Additional living costs and backlogged living costs from being unable to gainfully work during treatments in the town she is in in Sweden and receiving no government assistance or any other insurance aid*Sourcing key support and resources such as long-term financial and life security planning, especially in light of her cancerEvery little bit will help - please give if you can and share with your networks!",7a700f4a1b38375c23dcd3c68fb7025e,12,0.2955,24.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

His entire world was turned upside down. That next Tuesday, on January 29th we went to his first appointment, where they decided to admit him to the hospital. This was decided because his femur was at risk of breaking, and also they thought it would be easier to be in the hospital and get all the tests done instead of doing a ton of out patient appointments. So he was admitted on that Tuesday, and we are still here in the hospital as of today the 4th of February. They have done 2 biopsies and discovered that he has a very large Stage 4 Gastrointestinal Stromel tumor on his liver, that has spread to areas on his spine and other bones, including his femur. Once we found that out they went ahead and did another surgery and placed a rod into his femur to protect it from breaking. So right now he is just recovering and getting lots and lots of rest.The plan when he discharges from here is to start Chemotherapy and Radiation, and also go down to MD Anderson in Houston, TX! My brothers and I all know that our dad is a very loved guy!! And very well known. He has such a giving heart and will give his last penny to anyone he knows. He is the most selfless person I have ever met. And to see him going through this is very tough but the strength and hope he has is so inspiring. We have decided to create this GoFund me page to raise money for the hospital bills, the future medical bills wether that be more hospital stays, or just all of his appointments he will be going to. Also his medications he will be on. And raising money to get down to MD Anderson in Houston, TX so we can get the best treatment possible for him. Like I mentioned we know that our dad is loved by so many! So we thought this was a great way to spread the word, keep you guys updated and give anyone the chance to help if they felt called to!!The phrase we have chose is #WITHGOD. #WITHGOD he has strength during this journey#WITHGOD he has peace through this #WITHGOD he has hope in this #WITHGOD he has belief that God is a miracle worker and can get him through this.We are huge believers in prayer, so we ask if you can't give that you guys would join us in prayer for our dad, this is going to be a very long tough journey, but with prayer and #WITHGOD he can do this!!!! Thank you guys so much in advance.  We couldn't do it without you guys!

We are struggling financially since we have lost two thirds of our income, with medical bills, medications, home improvements are required to make our home safe and accessible for Steve ( ramps, grab bars, smooth surface walkway and drive)  as he adjusts to his new disabilities. My family needs your help  and  It is thus with very heavy hearts that we seek support from others to help make Steve comfortable and safe while he lives with the effects of this tumor and resulting seizures.  With kindness, love and heartfelt appreciation, we  thank you for your consideration and any financial help you can provide.Tomorrow is not a promise. Live, Laugh, and Love.Hibbert FamilyA foot noteWe held off on a gofundme for Steven,  because  my Daughter Sammy wanted to raise money for the Dana Farber Cancer Half Marathon  Sam  writes below,""I never considered myself a runner, even after years of running track in middle and high school. I never had to run for very long and I wasn’t very fast. It was more just something to do. I did manage to almost complete a season of cross country where I amazed myself by running 3 miles nonstop, once. I have run a handful of 5K’s in the past just to say I have done them but I never particularly enjoyed them. It’s not that I don’t like running, I was just never good at it.Over the years I have transitioned myself into a body- building workout regiment where my occasional cardio is the stairmaster. I haven’t run in years!This past January, my entire world was flipped upside down when my dad had a seizure which was caused by a cancerous brain tumor that could not be fullyremoved. Post surgery was rough and I didn’t believepeople when they told me that would be the easiest part. Then came the chemo and radiation. Watchingone of the strongest people I know go through that was, and still is, devastating. It is heartbreaking to see someone get knocked down by this brutal illness and struggle to do certain tasks or activities. Especially someone like my dad who was always working on several projects at once. I did everything I could to help but it never felt like enough. I wanted to do more but I wanted to have to work for it. I wanted it to be hard and painful and something I would have to force myself to do. Just like my dad had to force himself to go through radiation or another round of chemo cycling.Fundraising for brain cancer is a lot of bike rides and walks, neither of which I felt was hard enough for me. That was when a good friend sent me the link for Dana Farber Run any Race Fundraiser. She explained if I started training right away that I would have enough time to get myself up to 13.1 miles and she would run the race with me. I signed up immediately and barely completed a one mile run.With the heat and humidity most days the last thing I want to do is go for a run, let alone a long one. I can assure you the last thing my dad wants to do is go through another round of chemo cycling or have another MRI. That is what gets me outside running. It pushes me to run a little further each day. Nothing is worse than going through cancer treatment, and for me to watch a loved one go through it first-hand has been the biggest motivation. I am running for every single person going through what my dad is, to help bring an end to the disease someday. I will run the miles that most people receiving cancer treatment cannot, so hopefully one day they can run again too.- Samantha Hibbert",d7c694bcd79e7a38b357e53154da886c,39,0.6228888888888889,60.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

He especially likes when he gets to snuggle with his daddy. He and Daddy have a special bond between them.  He always sleeps with three stuffed animals and one is always the same. It’s a dog called Bolt from the Disney movie. He will rotate the other animals around but he always has Bolt.  In fact, Bolt is here in the hospital with us and it’s getting pretty ragged. He will always share whatever he has without question whether it be food or toys or anything.  When he gets in trouble or does something he shouldn’t, he is always the first to want to say sorry and mean it. There is not a mean bone in this little boy’s body.  Mommy and  Mayz have  a special relationship too. He will pick flowers out of the front yard or anywhere to give to Mom almost every day. He tells Mom that she is beautiful and that he loves her all the time. He’s even says, ""You are the best mommy in the whole world.""   He always wants to help Mom bring in the groceries, make dinner or cleanup. He is the first person to give you a hug when you are feeling sad. He plays baseball and loves his video games. He is a huge fan of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Star Wars. Mayz also loves the Angels and his favorite player is Mike Trout. He even picked #27 for his jersey number this year.  Early in March 2018, Mayz had a simple headache and went to the Doctor. That simple headache turned out to be every parent's worst nightmare, a malignant brain tumor. On March 12th, he had surgery to remove his tumor, which Doctors were able to completely remove. Unfortunately during that surgery, it was found that he has small spots on the backside of his brain and spine. Mayz had another surgery a few days after to put in a small tube to let fluid be released more naturally. This is an alternative to getting a permanent shunt. We are hopeful that this procedure works so that we don’t have to have another one. Pathology came back with results on the tumor. It is Medulloblastoma “metastatic” meaning it’s trying to spread.  This explains the spots the doctor saw in his brain and on his spine. He is at high-risk and will most likely need radiation and chemo therapy, maybe even at the same time. We keep praying and staying positive for our little “ Warrior”. (Thanks to the Lozano family for this title!) Mayz misses his friends, family, and teammates and hopes to soon be able to run, jump and play with everyone. He is a fighter with a never give up attitude and we all believe in his ability to make a full recovery. In the meantime, the whole process has been extremely hard on not only him but his family. His Mom Heather, Dad AJ, and Brothers Johnny and Skyler have all been doing their best to be there for him and cope with the situation.  THE ONE THING THE GONZALEZ FAMILY NEEDS IS THE GIFT OF TIME WITH MAYZ. EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR DONATED WILL GIVE HIS FAMILY THAT TIME. This page is set up to help Mayz and his family in this difficult time. Any and all types of donations are considered a blessing. We thank you all so much for your love and support. Please support Mayz by keeping him in your thoughts and prayers!

In between surgery’s she went through 7 months of chemo and came out on top.  All her bloodwork was coming back normal and everything looked good. For the the past couple months she has been having a lot of stomach pain.  The doctors thought that the pain was coming from all of her scar tissue from her pervious surgery’s. On Tuesday Oct 9th they went in to remove some of her scar tissue.

hope for remission, hope for a cure.Pauline is also doing her part to make sure that others will not have to live with this unfair disease.  She is participating in reasearch studies and clinical trials with no benefit to herself providing researchers with more data on how the disease progresses.  Even during her own medical crisis, Pauline continues to do and think of others.  With her support system of family, friends, and colleagues Pauline has taken part in three local ALS walks, raising thousands of dollars for ALS research and advocacy.  This past June, Pauline and her family, along with numerous Hommocks teachers and friends particiapted in the Westchester ALS walk at Manhattanville College, raising money for a cure.Pauline remains connected to her Hommocks family through the numerous friendships she has made over the years and the profound impact she's had on the Science department both as a seventh grade teacher and chairperson.  She visits when possible, and enjoys hearing from her former students.  Pauline is a fighter.  She continues to be optimistic about her condition.  She tries to live her life as normally as possible.  Pauline's children are the source of her strength.  They inspire her to keep going and provide her with the joys only toddlers can bring - giving hugs and smiles when they are needed the most!Officially retired from her teaching position at Hommocks Middle School as of last June, the financial road for Pauline and her family has become more difficult.  Pauline and her family are now focusing their efforts on finding a ranch-style home which is wheelchair accessible, where Pauline can continue to raise her children and provide them a nurturing environment close to family and friends.  She also requires private home health care which is not covered by health insurance.  Please keep your eyes and ears open for an affordable four bedroom ranch house in the area so her children can attend school with friends.  Pauline means so much to so many people.  As a daughter, sister, wife, teacher, and friend she has always been there to help and lend a hand.  Pauline is tremendously grateful for all of the love and support she's received since sharing her story.  Your generosity and warm wishes are truly appreciated, and she continues to fight for a better tomorrow.  Let's come together to do something wonderful for this incredible wife, daughter and mother.  Please donate to help ease her family's growing financial burden.",fed292288c025c99898ae5d44d4f7b8e,49,0.184492,720.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

But she is finally moving forward on February 18. We still need a little bit more to complete her transplant fund... WE NEED YOUR HELP. Trisha's 22nd birthday is on February 12. (Wow, it's been 2 years since she first felt the tumor.) She is almost done with the battle. Please help us make this the year that Trisha finally beat cancer. <3 THANK YOU!Please continue to pray for us, donate, and share our fundraising page.———Hello everyone!First of all, my family and I would like to thank everyone who donated to our previous fundraising (hosted on YouCaring) that successfully funded my sister Trisha's fight against Stage IVA Classic Hodgkin's Lymphoma Mixed Cellularity--12 sessions of ABVD chemotherapy, PET CT scans, laboratory tests, medications, etc. Her last ABVD chemotherapy session (aka graduation) was on July 2, 2018. We were so thankful and hopeful that the treatment was a complete success (based on her March scan done just after 4 sessions of chemotherapy that said she is almost free of cancer).Unfortunately, the battle is not over yet.She went for a PET CT Scan on September 24, just 12 weeks after her last chemo, and it showed that she has active recurrent lymphoma. Apparently, she had tumour/s resistant to chemotherapy and that there are new growths in the lymph nodes of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis areas. It has also now spread beyond the lymph nodes and they found tumours in the marrow of her pelvis and spleen.We are all taken aback and devastated with these recent results. We thought everything was okay now. That the cancer is gone, done, defeated.In those 3 months after her last chemo session, Trisha started her road to recovery. She still couldn't go back to school but at least she was gaining her strength back. Her hair started growing again. All the side effects of chemotherapy were slowly disappearing. She even started crocheting Amigurumi keychains and tops. She was starting to rebuild her life and feel great again.But now, we have to go for more aggressive chemotherapy and transplant. We are lost and scared. During the doctor's appointment on Thursday, Sep 27, while discussing the results, my mom saw huge drops of tears falling from my sister's eyes. She was bravely asking the doctor, ""ano ano pa po ang mga pwedeng gawin para mapahaba ang buhay ko?"" (What are the next steps that we should do to extend my life?) She was trying to put on a brave face and a smile while crying. My mom saw how really scared my sister was. :((Being given news that you have cancer is already scary... but after having gone through treatment and being told that you have refractory lymphoma is most definitely heartbreaking and devastating, like you feel the world is crashing down on you. **Refractory cancer means it did not respond to a previous attempted cancer treatment. The cancer was initially responsive to treatment but between March and September scan, somehow it developed resistance. So here I am, knocking on your hearts once more. We need your help now more than ever. #TrishaIsFighting and we will continue to support her in every possible way.As outlined by her team of doctors, she needs to go for insertion of port-a-cath, bone marrow biopsy, at least 3 cycles of ESHAP chemotherapy which involves staying in the hospital for 5 days, PET CT scan, stem cell harvesting, autologous stem cell transplant, and numerous laboratory tests. She also needs medications during and in-between treatments. The doctors estimated that we need at least PhP 3,000,000 (around C$ 75,000) for everything, including transplant. And if we proceed as soon as possible, she'll be done with the treatments early 2019.We had some leftover funds from the previous campaign, which we have started to use for her laboratory tests this Sunday, Sep 30, in preparation for a port-a-cath insertion surgery and bone marrow biopsy tomorrow (Monday, Oct 1).(This portacath is a device implanted under Trisha's skin which allows easy venous access so that it will be easier and less painful for her to go through frequent and continuous administration of chemotherapy.)But we have no money at all to start at least the first session of chemotherapy, which costs PhP 150,000 (around C$ 3,600). We are hoping to have her go for the first session this coming Tuesday to Saturday so at least the fight against these new tumours have already started.My sister Mariah and I are the only ones helping our father with all the family expenses. We barely have enough as it is. And now just as we were starting to recover, we have to go through more treatments. We have no assets to sell, so we really have nothing. :( Unfortunately, this is how healthcare in the Philippines is. You need money because hospital services are not covered, not like here in Canada where medically necessary hospital services are covered so that patients don't have to stress and worry about money and can just focus on getting better.(As we were thinking on ways to raise funds again, Trisha asked me 2 days ago if maybe we should start selling her dentistry tools and equipment. :(( I told her NO. She will survive this and she will continue on to becoming a wonderful and successful dentist. Her dreams will become a reality. It will just take a little more time, but she will make it through.)This is another race against time. Please help us save Trisha's life and fund her second round of cancer treatments. We have come this far... and we will continue to keep moving forward. Trisha has a bright future ahead of her and she deserves every chance she can get to beat the big C.

Samuel was sent to Golisano Children’s Hospital where the first aspiration biopsy was performed between his ribs, but the result was inconclusive as the sample size was to small to make a determination about the specific details of his particular cancer. Details are needed in order for the doctors to decide on the specific kind of chemotherapy, so an additional, more invasive biopsy was performed. In the midst of this emotional storm and the hope that we would wake up and all of this would have been a nightmare, we received the news that Samuel has five more cancer spots in his body. One nodule in his neck, two in the spine, one in the femur, and one in the hip.We are devastated! Samuel is hospitalized and he was submitted to second biopsy on November 30th. We already know that Samuel will have a long and very challenging road ahead of him. I would like to count on all of you with your prayers and also with financial help, so my cousin can be with his mother and she will not have to worry about the bills that will not stop coming.Maria Cristina and her husband Alex work cleaning houses, and when they do not work, money stops coming in. They do not have any insurance or work benefits that would help with paid leave or anything similar. Because of that, I am counting with your help so this family can have a little bit of tranquility in this moment of anguish and fight for the life of their son Samuel. Any help will be a blessing to their lives. ALONE WE ARE WEAK, BUT TOGETHER WE ARE INVINCIBLE!

Suddenly, out of nowhere, lightning strikes from the sky and changes your life forever.In a sense, that’s what has happened for my brother, George Rykovich.

After that, he’s not sure what he’s going to do to pay his bills for daily living, not to mention medical costs. It’s taking a great toll on his wife Dawn and his son Geordy, not knowing what they’re going to do when his sick leave runs out.That’s why I’m asking you to donate whatever you can to help keep his daily life going.

My wife, my love Rochelle Brooks was diagnosed with Triple Negative breast cancer.Triple negative cancer is a rarer aggressive form of breast cancer that developed into a tumor in her left breast and metastasized to the nearbylymph nodes. We’re in testing (pet scan) to see if its spread anywhere beyond that and praying that it hasn’t.To say we were shocked has been a understatement. Rochelle is probably the healthiest person I know. Eats very clean (vegetarian), doesn’t smoke, drinks wine and the occasional beer moderately, not to mention is very young (just turned 40 two weeks earlier).We were both a mess for the first few days. Tons of crying, thoughts of mortality combined with “why did this all happen”... and more than anything, we’re scared, actually terrified.Our biggest worry before this was which of our two pugs (Jax or Jake) had gotten jealous of each other, peed somewhere they shouldn’t have, or someone wasn’t getting enough attention.All weekends involved them, going for walks, an occasional lunch/beer at our local haunts or planning when we might be able to get a small vacation. We were being a family, enjoying our life with normal worries, stresses and dreams.Rochelle and I have a decent health insurance plan, but since we rarely get sick our plan is catered to that. When Rochelle got sick with cancer, she couldn’t have gotten anything worse.Since day one Rochelle has refined her diet to cater to a no acidic, high alkaline diet. Cancer cells have a difficult time living in a high alkaline environment. She has eliminated sugar, coffee, all alcohol, grains, wheat and replaced with all organic fruit, vegetable, raw, and supplemental diet.She’s a warrior and is determined...but doesn’t take much to feel massively overwhelmed over this new fight we have had dropped in our lap.


Since the diagnosis, the past month has been spent meeting with oncologists, researching holistic methods (Rochelle’s Mom has spent the last couple of years dealing with cancer on a holistic level), blood tests, mri’s and ultrasounds. Trying to get a plan in action to get the best plan to conquer this disease and get Rochelle cancer free.

Sufficed to say the costs and bills have started to mount...and we aren’t in treatment yet. We want our life back and it’s going to be a big fight, and we need your help. 


If the pet scan comes back that the cancer hasn't spread beyond what we know, we will be starting very soon 8 rounds of chemo over 4 months, surgery (most likely double masectomy), then post surgery chemo/radiation. Following that most likely reconstructive surgery after the double masectomy.


In short a long road. Please consider donating to help us with the expected, and unexpected, expenses associated with the tough fight ahead. Your donations will be placed into a account to help cover insurance copays and deductibles related to treatments, potential clinical trials and treatments not covered by insurance, medication, a wig for the duration of the chemotherapy just to name a few.


Any help you can contribute is massively appreciated and will show we're not alone in this fight. Thank you so much!",257d30edc57a5618f055516e3ece128b,21,0.5465571428571429,120.0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

He’s a good guy.When I recently heard of Brad's diagnosis, I reached out to his wife, Lyndsey, to see if they needed any help outside of love and prayers to soften the financial burden that cancer treatment can bear. With her approval, here we are. Lyndsey has provided a more detailed background below! Thank you for any and every bit of help you can spare!From Brad's wife, Lyndsey:In January 2017, Brad was diagnosed with Testicular Cancer. After having surgery to remove the tumor Brad was put on active surveillance (CT scans and blood work). He was in the clear until the fall of 2018 when his doctors noticed several enlarged lymph nodes growing on his aorta and IVC, which required him to need immediate surgery at UVA to remove all of the the lymph nodes in his retroperitoneal/stomach area. He came out of an 8 hour RPLND surgery and a week later learned several of those lymph nodes came back malignant. His doctors now consider the disease at a stage II. The next step was for Brad to have two cycles of chemotherapy to knock out any remaining cancer cells  in his body. Brad is finishing up his first cycle this week, and will start the second chemo cycle at the end of the month. He will need ct scans and blood work for the next 5 years, which is protocol for this type of cancer. He has been strong through all of this, it has most definitely been a whirlwind for the last 3 months. As we continue to go to the various doctor appts, and chemotherapy sessions, the medical bills are mounting.

Lance and Jen now need our help in raising funds to help offset the medical costs in order to provide Lance the care he needs to win this fight. The hospital expenses for this year are expected to reach $15,000 in out of pocket expenses, and we are trying to come up with additional funds to cover the cost of naturopathic oncology care which is not covered by health insurance. In the midst of all of these new and unexpected expenses, Lance is no longer able to work and Jen has been forced to take an extended leave of absence to care for him at home. Here is how our family’s story about how Lance”R” beats cancer begins…Lance and Jen fell in love and got married in July 2016. They had a blast building a tiny home in Portland, OR and starting their life together with their dog, Floyd. After 18 months of tiny home living, they relocated to their current home in Salem, OR in late 2017 and just began settling in. 2018 hit like a ton of bricks. Lance was hospitalized on December 31, 2017 after returning home to Salem, OR from a trip to visit Jen’s family in Chicago, IL over Christmas. Initial imaging indicated a kidney infection and inflammation in the abdomen.  Other symptoms included severe hip pain, weight loss and loss of appetite. Lance was released on January 2nd after undergoing a colonoscopy and having a stint put in the left ureter to help his left kidney drain. After discharge, lymphedema of the torso, hips, thighs and ankles sent him back to the ER.Results a few days later showed cancer cells in the colon.  Lance was admitted to Salem hospital on January 5th and his oncologist performed more tests.  Results showed stage 4 cancer of unknown origins.  There was evidence of cancer in many places, including the colon, lymph nodes and bones.  Without knowing where the cancer had begun, Lance’s oncologist began chemo the next morning using a cocktail of carboplatin and paclitaxel.  This combination is a treatment for many common forms of cancer, and we were hoping this would target and kill the cancer cells while we were waiting for more advanced tests to reveal the origin of the cancer.On January 24th, the day before he was due for his second round of chemo, Lance’s doctor decided to change course of treatment.  He felt that the drugs were not working, and preliminary results indicated the possibility of the cancer starting somewhere in his GI tract.  Dr. Pierce decided to change the chemo to Fluorouracil (5-flourouracil), Leucovorin and Oxaliplatin.  These drugs will target more specifically cancers of the GI systems. Lance is young, healthy and strong. He and Jen are confident he can fight this and will be sent into remission, and eventually be cured. Anything you are able to contribute will be helpful to them during this time.  There is no amount too small.   As Lance begins to heal, they are excited to settle back into their happy life together.Lance's wife, Jen habada will be accepting funds on his behalf to pay  expenses directly.",4f87fecf7add361d1a45c57adfcc2487,26,0.985,360.0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Yeah... I’m not sure, either!￼The Long StoryLast January I dedicated  my 33rd year to prioritizing my health and my mind. In February I started a new job as a women's health social worker in Pittsburgh while continuing to teach yoga in the evenings. March left me with a fibromyalgia diagnosis. I began a treatment plan in April that included physical & occupational therapy, medication management, talk therapy, and weekly appointments. Prompted by my family’s medical history, I elected to undergo genetic cancer screening in June. I lost my dad to pancreatic cancer when I was 23 (2018 was the 10th anniversary of his passing), as well as his mother and her three sisters to breast cancer before they reached the age of 45. ￼￼My screen revealed a BRCA2 gene mutation, which prompted mammogram #1 on September 15th & recall mammogram #2 on September 27th. Round two uncovered abnormal imaging and cued biopsies on each side. Sierra and I were scheduled to leave one day later for our vacation, where we would become engaged. I was advised to schedule my first biopsy for the Monday following our return. While at home recovering from that biopsy, I  was laid off from my job and informed that I would lose my health insurance at the end of that month. The pathology results came back four days later. ￼￼It's cancer. Despite all of the questions that have come up, I'm certain that I need to accept a new reality. I'll be unable to secure employment until I recover from my bilateral mastectomy, reconstruction, radiation, and possible chemotherapy. I turned 34 two days after surgery. My fertility doctor prescribed back-to-back cycles of hormone injections and egg retrievals in order to expedite the IVF process for my fiance and I. All of the above-mentioned procedures cost as much in dollars as they do time and sanity, yet are necessary in order to mitigate the side effects of treatment and give me any sort of chance at having kids in the future. This will all be in addition to the general cost of living a life, of course. Sort of like a, ""Bi*ch-I-know-cancer-is-extra"", type of situation.￼￼I’ve always prided myself on being an independent, “I-can-do-it-myself” type of woman. It goes without saying that it’s entirely out of my comfort zone to ask for help. My new reality has shown me that this type of pride can be driven by poor self-worth and shame. In the past, I’ve sacrificed plenty of comfort zones in an effort to impact and be impacted by this big, beautiful, wild world. So, fuck it...  GOODBYE COMFORT ZONE ￼               I have cancer and I need your help. My family needs your help.  Every cent counts right now and each one means more than I can convey.

These expenses are all about the $3000 we fell short of on the first gofundme.Neil, being hard working and proud (stubborn) doesn't know we are creating a gofundme. He is overwhelmed (as our the rest of us) and thankful for the support that has already come. However, there are times and situations where you should except the help.Thank you all for donating and sharing.If you would like to read Neils full story please scroll down. Wishing you all health and happiness.I am sure most of you know Neil's story. For those of you who don't. I will give a brief recap. In May 2016 Neil began experiencing pain and abnormalities in his mouth. Over the following 8 months he saw  at least 15 doctors specializing in different fields from the dentist, oral surgeons, family doctor, emergency doctors, ENTs, infectious diseases, and a dermatologist. He has endured many tests, biopsies, and CT scans. He was poked and prodded. Eating and drinking were a chore and extremely painful. Sleep was nonexistent. He tried to keep a normal life with family and work, but by October he could no longer do this due to the pain, lack of nutrition, lack of sleep as well as the medication. Finally, early 2017 he was diagnosed with oral squamous cell carcinoma. He was sent to the Ottawa Cancer clinic at the General Hospital to see a surgeon. The best option for him was what is called a Partial Maxillectomy. This is where they remove part of your upper jaw. Before surgery he had to do more tests and see a dentist and prosthodontist. The dental portion of all this is not covered. They had to prepare his mouth for a prosthetic appliance. To do this his mouth had to be in top shape and cavity free. There would be a total of three appliances. The first one would be brought with us to surgery, the second one would be more fitted and put in a few weeks after surgery and then a final one when all is said and done. On March 24th Neil went in for surgery. They removed his left upper jaw as well as part of his hard palate and soft palate. Three holes in total. These holes are permanent and lead to his sinuses. The prosthetic appliance otherwise known as an obturator is like a retainer, it replaces the jaw bone, teeth and covers the holes. It has to be adjusted as his mouth heals. (We were there at least once a week if not more). Without the obturator he can not eat, drink, or speak. These appliances are not cheap, each one is approximately $1700. Both of us are hard workers with benefits. We have maxed our benefits for this year between biopsies, fillings, xrays, cleanings as well as other procedures.After the surgery we were told he had positive margins. The cancer had spread to areas they could not remove, so radiation and chemotherapy treatments were recommended. On May 8th Neil began his treatments. He would endure 6.5 weeks of daily treatments of radiation and chemotherapy (cesplatin).  After each round of chemo a home care nurse was required to come in to administer IV hydration daily for a week. Unfortunately his veins would always collapse anytime they needed to take blood, give meds, including chemo, hydration or insert an IV. So he had a procedure to insert a PICC line. This is like a permanent IV, but not as uncomfortable and can be left in for a long period of time.Treatment was brutal. He described radiation as someone holding your mouth open with a lighter inside.  Chemo was just as bad. Each round was 5 hours long. The side effects range from nausea and vomiting, hairloss, ringing in your ears and painful hiccups that would last for days. It wasn't long after treatment started that he was no longer able to have the obturator in his mouth because of the sores and inflammation. This made it impossible to eat or drink. They tried a feeding tube through his nose, but that only caused more discomfort. Within a week he had a PEG feeding tube inserted into his abdomen. He wanted to quit many times and had to be admitted into the hospital close to the end in order to complete the rest of his treatments. June 22nd was his last day. The next 2-3weeks were up and down and still are. We just got him off hydration but he still has the PEG tube for feeding. I am feeding him 4 times a day. He also gets his meds through the tube as he still can't swallow. Throughout treatments he was seen by a dietician weekly. He has lost 40lbs since surgery. He is also seen by a speech pathologist. Between the surgery, treatments and not being able to eat or drink he has lost the ability to open his mouth or swallow. There is a new appliance called a Therabite to assist in strengthening the jaw and throat muscles. This appliance is $480, and then there are bite pads $20/4pads. It is not covered by our plans. It is needed so that he can eat, drink and speak again. It takes about 8 weeks to heal from treatment. He has an appointment with the surgeon on the 17th. We are hoping by then his mouth will be well enough to start using the Therabite and arrange for a new obturator.For now the feeding tube will stay until he is able to eat and drink enough on his own for at least 2 weeks. His energy level probably won't be back to norm for a year maybe even 2 years and side effects can last 18 months.Neil has been on long term disability and I've been receiving Compassionate Care as his caretaker. Neil's job is physically demanding as a driver for the City of Ottawa. He needs to be alert and fit. As crazy as it sounds to some of us, he would really like to get back to work, routine, and a normal life again. This has been a very stressful time in our lives. We are so thankful for all the love and support we have received. It has helped tremendously. This is a long journey with hopefully a happy ending. The less stress Neil has in his life the faster and easier the healing will be.So please share, share, share and I will keep you all updated on his progress.",9cd0dc515ff274c2b9d297fe4e77f13a,77,0.8965,540.0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Luckily, my health insurance covers chemo and radiation.  But fertility treatments are not covered by my insurance.What This Means to MeI've always wanted to become a parent.  Your gift means I won't have to lose this option on top of what I'm going through now, and the months of difficult treatments ahead of me.  I'm so grateful to have the option to preserve my fertility - but it is out of our reach financially.  Your support is a HUGE relief!The CostsThe total cost of freezing my eggs will be $7,363.  This includes two weeks of daily doctors visits and medications, surgery to collect the eggs, and five years of storage.I have already missed work to recover from surgery.  I hope to be able to work through chemo, but realistically, I may need to miss more work.  Brian and I were also both going through job transitions when I got my diagnosis.  Worries about rent and bills are adding stress to an already challenging time.Cancer also comes with lots of hidden costs that add up quickly: transportation to many doctors visits, supplies for getting through recovery, etc.  If we raise enough to pay for freezing my eggs, all additional funds will go toward these medical and living expenses.  How You Can Help Donate what you can Share with friends Check in with others to see if they've donatedIf you can't donate - just send me a supportive message.  It means a lot!I am so, so grateful for the support of my amazing community of friends.  I love each and every one of you so much!",da46ee67b14b1c167d037217b0b0af91,17,1.93,30.0,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

In August of 2017 Jeffrey was laid of from work  and within weeks he was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer. Jeff immediately began  chemotherapy and radiation at MGH in Boston. Then, in October of 2017, Sophie was in a car accident and was out of work for 4 months with a back injury. This just added worry and distress to the family. In August 2018, after 8 months of chemotherapy and radiation, Jeff was given hope that with his positive reaction to treatment that surgery would be an option to remove the tumor in his pancreas.  In August he had surgery and the surgical team  removed part of his pancreas, his left adrenal gland, and his spleen. Surgery was successful  but it was short lived.  Within days Jeff was unable to eat or drink  and began  experiencing pain in his back.  Jeff was readmitted to the hospital and diagnosed with having pneumonia and fluid in his lungs.  Sadly, this fluid tested positive for cancer and the oncology team believe that it  is in other parts of his body.  Jeff began chemotherapy right away to fight against the aggressive cancer.  He is in the hospital receiving chemotherapy treatment and trying to figure out how to manage his pain. This news has been devastating for Jeff and his family both spiritually, emotionally and financially.Dealing with cancer is expensive, regardless of the type of health insurance. They are incredibly thankful for the amazing generosity of family, friends, church and school and that both children are happy in school and surrounded by people who care about them. While they appreciate all of the tremendous financial support thus far,  they do not know what the future will hold for the family and debt will continue to pile up. Significant dollars have gone to co-pays, child care, deductibles, and uncovered medications. On top of that is missed work.In addition to the medical expenses, their daughter Gracie started a new special school in September 2018 for Dyslexia. The cost of tuition is very expensive, and they will need help to make sure that she will be able to stay and finish the year.  They feel it was a huge blessing that she was accepted but it adds another major level of  financial stress.   Although they received some financial aid, unfortunately, the amount they still need to pay for the specialized education is becoming beyond the financial reach of the family.  If you can help in any way it would help them out tremendously. As part of their caring circle, we want to provide the Bishop family a cushion to help them through this difficult time. The hope is to allow them to focus on cherishing the time they have with their family. This time should be as positive as possible rather than fretting about monthly bills and financial stress. We want to encourage them to take any time and opportunity possible to make new family memories.As we ask for your financial assistance, we also ask that you continue to pray for peace and trust in God in this season of the unknown.  We need strength physically, emotionally, and spiritually during  treatments, and that Jeff will be HEALED! Any contribution is greatly appreciated large or small to help support Gracie’s educational need and Jeff’s health and healing.God Bless You.",785aacefa07a2e63a73a34b601a1889e,28,0.3228,120.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Charlie celebrated her first birthday and shortly after her parents noticed something was not right. They sought help at Princess Margarets Children’s Hospital, an initial diagnosis of Bell’s palsy was quickly overturned after her symptoms increased and an MRI was performed.The MRI revealed a large brain stem tumour (approx 26mm). A craniotomy (skull removal procedure) was preformed and the incredible team of neurosurgeons managed to remove as much as they could identify as abnormal. Unfortunately the biopsy has revealed that it is a malignant high grade form of cancer.The Tang family have a very tough road ahead with Charlie about to start an intensive course of chemotherapy and radiation treatment and battling the unknown with such a rare illness.

This is a secondary malignancy from radiation received for her leukemia diagnosis. Gracie will receive some very difficult radiation and chemo to help prolong life as much as possible. She has been given a two year survival rate, but if anyone can beat the odds, it's Gracie! Gracie's battle first began at the age of 3 when after enjoying a kids' show at the Lake Charles Civic Center, her parents noticed bruising on her and took her to the emergency room. She was transported to TX Children's Hospital in Houston that night and diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and began the very rough road of testing and treatment. A little over a year into treatment, Gracie relapsed. She endured all put before her including chemo and radiation with 'Grace', as her name implies. No matter the pain or illness, Gracie maintained her radiant smile and positive outlook giving strength to all around her. As this battle was going on, her father, James Johnson, a member of the National Guard, was called into battle in Iraq. While there, his transport vehicle was hit by an IED, killing some of his men and severely and permanently injuring James. Through it all, this family maintained their faith and a completely positive outlook.Fast forward to two weeks ago, when days before her senior prom, Gracie was hit with seizures. She was airlifted to TX Children's in Houston, where testing began. A mass was found on her brain and a biopsy scheduled. Her prom was brought to her in the best way they could manage by having her room decorated and dress, makeup, hair done. Gracie was named Prom Queen, fitting for such a sweet beauty. The devastating results of Gracie's biopsy were delivered to her parents in a conference call from Gracie's oncologist this weekend. They had to break this heartbreaking news to Gracie and her younger twin siblings. She received the news as she has lived her life, like a true champ, ready to fight like the warrior she is. Her dad reminded her that she has NO expiration stamp on her anywhere and that they won't claim this. Gracie's response to her diagnosis? ""I can't believe this. I don't even feel sick! I'm ready to do what it takes!"" Despite the grim prognosis, they are not giving up. Heather stated, ""Believe me, we have faith, but we do believe in modern medicine also. And we've decided that we will do whatever it takes."" Gracie has been dubbed Wonder Woman for her fighting spirit. PLEASE help this family meet the many expenses occurring and ahead that include medical expenses, time off of work, travel and stay in Houston, care for Gracie's twin siblings as they fight this, and too many unforeseen expenses to name.

Everything looked great and he was then sent for an ultrasound and his results were benign cysts. YAY. He then was sent to a ENT Specialist in November. She looked at the pictures and was confident she could go in there and remove them. Come JANUARY 29th 2019 Tuesday, Aiden had surgery to remove his ""benign cysts"" . After surgery His Dr came out and said his surgery went great BUT she didn't like the way this mass looked or felt. She literally said she couldn't tell if it was a cysts or lymph node. So, she sent it out for testing. We were told the test could take up to two weeks to get back to us, however,. THURSDAY January 31st TWO DAYS LATER she called and we received the news it was the C word... Cancer. Our son has cancer. Possibly Lymphoblastic Lymphoma or Leukemia. Which Lymphoma and Leukemia were both being thrown around so we were pretty confused. FRIDAY February 1st, both his Pediatrician and ENT Dr called and told us to go to the ER to be admitted for more testing not to wait on the Cancer Dr. Friday evening after more testing He was Officially Diagnosed with CANCER. February 5th Tuesday, Bubby had his chemo port placement, Bone Marrow biopsy on both hips, a Spinal tap and 1st round of Chemo in the spine. From those results Aiden's label came back he officially has Lymphoblastic Lymphoma. February 7th he had a PET AND CT scan. We're waiting for results. Aiden should be starts starting four day chemo here today Feb 8th. He's had horrible side effects for the past going on 3 days due to the Feb 5th procedures. Aiden can't play baseball this season or return to school. Well this is just the beginning. But I know with everyone's love, prayers, support Aiden is going to strike out Cancer. 
Anything helps.

After a partial lung removal, she is now undergoing 16-weeks of chemotherapy. The treatments are intense and come with a suite of side effects, including nausea and fatigue. Another side effect is treatment cost, which is terribly expensive, even with health insurance. 


Leveraging credit for treatment has worked so far but the chemo cost alone is $500 per visit and it's all adding up at a scary rate. 


Any support will ease the burden.  


All donations to this wellness fund will be used for immediate and future chemotherapy treatments. Any remaining funds will be used to offset the associated credit debt for past treatments.

In 2003 her life was just beginning, with a young son and many years of happiness to look forward to, when she was diagnosed with Stage 2 Multiple Myeloma.  After enduring chemotherapy and one failed stem cell transplant, she received a successful allogeneic transplant from stem cells donated by her sister.  It was a long battle and road to recovery that lasted from 2003 - 2008.  When another cancerous mass returned in her right leg, the doctors were able to remove it and treat it with radiation.  By the end of 2008, thankfully she was in remission. During the ensuing years she worked hard at a local school and raising her son with her husband, Juan.  She contributed positively to her community of Humble, Texas, and continued being a blessing and a loving presence to all around her.  Unfortunately, in 2018 she heard the devastating news that cancer had returned.  She was diagnosed with Stage 4 Head and Neck cancer, specifically Tonsil cancer. This was not a metastasis of the original Multiple Myeloma,  but a new cancer that had developed with no known cause.  She has undergone radiation and chemotherapy and is due for further testing soon to determine her next course of treatment.   Naturally, her family, friends, and all those who love her are saddened by this new diagnosis. And although Norma and her husband work full time and have health insurance, they are now struggling not only with her health, but with funding the care that she needs to stay alive.  With co-pays in the thousands of dollars, missed time at work, and some procedures not fully covered by insurance, they have had to postpone much needed testing in order to save the money to pay for the procedure.  This is an urgent need and any donation towards furthering her treatment will help!  Give from your heart, because at the end of the day, we are all walking each other home.  Thank you all!",9e4516acf003eba5e0d8be357592dc6c,18,0.19,0.875,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

It’s hard for me sometimes to admit I need help & I don’t always find it easy to be open about what’s really going on for me. But it’s time now for me to step beyond my fears & reach out. In 2013, at the age of 53, I was blessed with the birth of my gorgeous baby boy. Truly a miracle. Born premature & with some challenges to overcome, but the most perfect & precious, longed for baby. On the same day I was diagnosed with breast cancer. What followed was frightening & exhausting & at times I wondered how we were going to make it through. But with wonderful care from an amazing medical team & the unwavering love & support of my steadfast friends, we managed. Sadly in 2015 I lost my mum to cancer & my dad shortly after due to complications of dementia. My marriage broke down & I found myself a single mum to my beautiful two year old son. Three years later, having returned to work part time, I was feeling well & looking forward to building a new life. Just a few months ago we moved to the Blue Mountains, I enrolled my son for kindergarten & was looking forward to re establishing my counselling practice. We celebrated Christmas in our new home, feeling happy & blessed. Then in the first week of January 2019, I received the news that the cancer has mestastasized. It has spread along my spine and pelvis & invaded my liver. I am due to start treatment at the Nepean Cancer Care Centre on the 24th January. I don’t know how much I will be able to work through this next phase of treatment. With no family here, there is only so much that my friends can continue to do to support me and my son. Without work I have no source of income. I need help to pay the rent, for food & transport, to pay the bills & the extra costs of treatment that aren't covered through medicare. I need the money to keep moving forward to provide a certain & safe future for myself & my little boy. The hardest part of this for me, is dealing with the fear that swamps me whenever I think that perhaps I won’t be here for my little boy. I waited so long to have him & he is the absolute light of my life. I love being his “mama” & I want to be here for him for many, many years to come. He needs his mum & five years ago I promised I wouldn’t leave him. If you feel you have the capacity to donate I will be truly grateful. Any amount no matter how small, will be appreciated more than you will ever know. I believe I will be well again. I have already been blessed by a miracle with the birth of my son. I believe I will be blessed again. I am so grateful for the love & support that has carried me through the past 5 years. I know this is just the next phase in our lives. To all who read this, thank you. And a huge thank you to my extraordinary friend Tracy, who helped set up this page. Tracy, you truly are an angel in our lives. Orlando & I love you so very much.

After two months of misdiagnosis, Remin got the shocking news that he has Thymic Large B Cell Lymphoma, a kind of blood cancer, and that his pain was being caused by a 14 cm tumor in his sternum. He underwent five months of chemotherapy and his tumor decreased to 3.5 cm. His doctors were expecting a complete remission. He resumed work in Freeport, TX. But his 3-month follow-up PET scan and biopsy was not good news and showed the cancer has come back aggressively, the tumor is growing, and bringing the danger of spreading to other organs. Remin’s tumor is inoperable because of its location between his heart and his lungs, too enmeshed in major blood vessels to be safely removed. For the same reason, he cannot get radiation; that would also damage the surrounding organs too much. His doctors have told us that his only chance for a cure will be a bone marrow transplant. If he does not get it, he will die within a short time.Doctors have immediately switched him from chemotherapy to immunotherapy in the hopes of strengthening his own immune system to kill the cancer cells. He is entering the process of finding a bone marrow donor who will be the right match, and dealing with all the details of arranging to get the transplant in India.Remin has used his entire savings from working in the US to pay for his first treatment and cope with his loss of income during his long months of chemo. He did not have employer-based insurance and by the time he applied for private insurance, he was refused coverage due to his condition. No bone marrow transplants are performed in the USA without insurance. The best hope for him now is to go to India to receive the conditioning regimen and transplant. This necessary treatment ranges from 40 to 60 lakhs Indian Rupees ($60,000 - $80-000 USD).All funds raised will go to pay for Remin’s treatment, travel and family support. Will you help us save Remin’s life?

My father in law, Jeff Hoffman, was diagnosed with Kidney cancer in the summer of 2018. He had surgery to remove the tumor on 8/17/18 and the doctor said everything went perfectly. Jeff was doing amazing when we saw him at Thanksgiving and said he felt great and started taking oral chemo not long after that. Fast forward to January 2019...Jeff went to the doctor for his regular screens and blood tests. The doctor noticed something off with his blood work so they scheduled a CT scan and a follow up visit. The next Monday we got the dreaded text from Mike's mom, Sandra, that, short story, they had to go to the oncologist on Friday because the cancer came back and had spread. They learned that Jeff has non-clear cell carcinoma which is a rare form of cancer that does not respond to traditional chemo. He has tumors in his liver, lungs, lymph nodes and spine, as well as one on his pituitary gland in his brain. He has been in and out of the hospital getting blood transfusions, calcium infusions, lab work, testing, etc. He has had trouble breathing and went to the ER yesterday to find out he has fluid in his lungs, which the doctors think was a reaction to the blood transfusion he had on Wednesday. Update as of now is that they have been accepted into MD Anderson and they are waiting to make an appointment. They were told they did not have anything available until Mid February, but his oncologist is working diligently to get him in sooner. There is a doctor there that specializes in non-clear cell carcinoma that we want him to see asap. Jeff has been trying to work from home as much as he can and Sandra has been going to the office between appointments and when he is feeling ok, but them stressing over money is the absolute last thing I want them to have to do.

During the two weeks between surgery and getting the pathology report back; Jason was sent home to heal and be with his beautiful family while we all prayed for a favorable pathology report. Unfortunately, on March 6th pathology came back and confirmed that the aggressively growing tumor was a stage 4 glioblastoma - a type of tumor that has a high rate of recurrence.   https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-tumor/glioblastoma#modal-close ‌He was also given the news that because of the genetic makeup of the tumor, he does not qualify for any clinical trials. Treatment for glioblastoma includes an oral chemotherapy medication as well as radiation. Jason also hopes to add some alternative adjunctive therapies including ketogenic diet to support his healing during treatment and beat the odds on this terrible cancer.

After being referred to several clinics & doctors, he landed at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester and received the devastating news. Ben was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cancer called rhabdomyosarcoma. Tumors had formed--one in his sinuses and one in a lymph node. THE PLANEven though Ben’s senior year had already started, he was forced to move home and begin treatment immediately. He began receiving 6 weeks of daily chemotherapy and radiation simultaneously at the Mayo Clinic through December.  Ben and Precious lived in Rochester for the entire 6 weeks.  Ben continues to receive chemo and will through at least the beginning of July, 2018. Thank God, the tumor has begun to shrink and the cancer in his lymph node appears to be gone! However, if the tumor in his sinuses is not completely gone by July, it is likely Ben will undergo  surgery to remove it. THE COSTSTo Ben:  Ben’s body has/is going through hell—he has lost a great deal of weight, has sores in his mouth and has extreme fatigue. He’s not able to attend school or work. He doesn't have the energy to be with friends and simply walking up steps causes shortness of breath. At one time, Ben was a muscular, athletic track star, a basketball and football player, and a social young man.  Well, not anymore! To his Family:   Ben’s father (Michael Ojika) works in Oklahoma to provide for his family and carry their health insurance. He has very limited time to take off from work and come home. This causes Ben’s mother, Precious, to carry the bulk of the responsibility for physically caring for Ben.  Precious attends every appointment and procedure—no matter how many days of work she has to miss. There are lots of trips to Rochester (Mayo Clinic), some visits for a week at a time. With every trip, there are unforeseen costs.  Every appointment & procedure (labs, radiation, chemo, MRIs, PET scans) comes with a cost. The goal is to help offset their 2017 & 2018 Out of Pocket costs.  Come July 2018, they will have incurred well over $100,000 in Out of Pocket medical costs.  However, it’s difficult to estimate the TOTAL COST of Ben’s treatment (ie, replacement of lost wages, travel, lodging, meals, meds, new clothes from weight loss, etc). 2 THINGS YOU CAN DO TO HELP:1)    As you know, medical costs are astronomical and that is why we are asking for your help.  First and foremost, Ben and his family need money for treatment costs. Their debt causes a great deal of stress and worries which we hope to alleviate. 2)     Help get the word out about this campaign! PLEASE SHARE this GOFUNDME link:  https://www.gofundme.com/benojikasrace(using FACEBOOK, TWITTER, EMAIL, etc--see top and bottom of this page) with:**anyone who knows Ben and/or his family **people in the community**your church families**your friends who have compassion for others  Whether it's prayer, reaching out to Precious, Michael and/or their children, sharing this campaign, or helping offset costs associated with Ben’s diagnosis…on behalf of the Ojika family, we thank you for any and all of the support received.  May God Bless You.",a7c29e5e9dde94bb46ae907883e70b47,45,0.7171,360.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Mother of five wonderful children. Dog mom to Spanky and Darla. 32 year veteran NICU nurse at Region One Medical Center in Memphis, TN. Our hero. Our cancer survivor. On December 23, 2017, a regular, scheduled mammogram was performed.  Robin has always made it a point to have these done yearly because of a strong family history and a suspicious spot on her left breast that ALWAYS gets a second look. A couple of weeks after the mammogram, Robin received a letter asking her to come back for a further look.  A second round of tests were performed in February of 2018. The doctor performed a ultrasound and 3D imaging after the mammogram. The ultrasound technician had Robin feel the lump in the side of her right breast, it was the size of a green pea and very much what you expect to feel if doing a self exam and finding something out of the norm. She had never felt this lump before. The other tumor found was a different story. It was spread out and uneven. Not something that anyone would have ever thought unusual, especially someone with particularly dense breast tissue. Robin was hit with this news by surprise as the left side had always been the ""problem"" side. A plan of action was quickly developed and so began Robin's unfamiliar journey as a breast cancer patient. Shortly after Robin's diagnosis, she was thrust into doctors offices to discuss treatment and surgery.  On February 23, Robin had a mastectomy. Exactly one month later, she began her chemo therapy treatment at West Cancer clinic in Memphis. In June, radiation therapy began at Baptist Cancer clinic. Radiation was performed five days a week for six weeks!!! After radiation came physical therapy for lymphedema. After just six weeks of her initial treatment, Robin’s sick time had run out. Robin’s coworkers graciously donated enough of their own time for a weeks worth of Robin’s pay and sold Team Robin t-shirts for another couple of weeks of pay to help soften the blow of not receiving income. This campaign is to help raise money to cover the out of network deductible for Robin's reconstruction surgery and for accommodation costs. Since there is NO microsurgeon that can perform this type of reconstruction in her area, she is having to travel out of state, making it out of network.  Reconstruction is scheduled to be performed on February 1, 2019 in New Orleans, LA at Center for Restorative Breast Surgery. The surgery is out of network and her deductible will have to be paid ten days before her surgery. Robin will have to stay in New Orleans a total of 10 days. Two days before surgery and four days after surgery so she can be close to her surgeon. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for taking the time to read about our Mother’s journey.",ed319f86a4f52bb6c901f019bf6704f3,33,0.8385714285714285,60.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

After consulting with his doctor, it was revealed that this isn’t just any type of cancer - it’s a variety so rare that only about 100 people a year are diagnosed with it.  As a result, there is very little research being done, no clear path towards treatment, and a very low survival rate.  To make matters worse, Dan was told that chemotherapy and radiation weren’t options for treatment because of his type of cancer and its location in his lungs.      With news this devastating, it would be easy for Dan to crumble beneath the weight of such a grim prognosis.  But rather than surrendering to his disease, Dan dug down deep inside and found something more powerful than fear – faith.  His faith in God carried him through this cancer when it first developed in his leg 4-years ago (which eventually went into remission), and it has sustained him since it’s reappearance in his lungs in September 2017.    That same faith has also given him hope and shown him a path towards recovery.  Since there is limited treatment for Myxoid Chondrosarcoma in the United States, Dan and his wife Lisa have travelled back and forth to C.H.I.P.S.A. hospital in Mexico in their search for a cure.  This hospital is on the cutting edge of various kinds of immunotherapies, which has shown real promise when treating cancers that won’t respond to more conventional methods.   Dan and Lisa are feeling overwhelmed by the substantial financial burden that Dan’s lifesaving treatment has cost them, but their faith and spirits have been bolstered by the fact that Dan’s cancer hasn’t progressed since he began his treatment at C.H.I.P.S.A. hospital in February 2018!  Considering how notoriously aggressive this cancer is, its arrest is nothing short of amazing!!   They are on the right path.  Now it’s up to us to make sure they can keep their focus on the path ahead of them and not on the money it’s going to take to keep them on it.  Money should never be the deciding factor between life and death – let’s make sure it’s not.  PLEASE support my brother Dan during his journey towards a cure.",3516cd4642c7f25be07e4ae6ec58443e,28,0.6955,120.0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

We are all devastated to learn that she was recently diagnosed with Stage IV Colorectal Cancer . 


After feeling some discomfort in weeks prior, Jamie set-up an appointment for a colonoscopy on October 7, 2017. The findings that morning indicated a mass in the recto sigmoid suspicious for cancer. Due to the severity, she was transferred to the ER for expedited work. Further testing revealed the mass was in fact cancer and had spread to her liver and lungs.  Jamie’s treatment has already begun and will be managed out of Sharp Memorial Hospital.


Jamie has lived her life brightening the day of everyone in her path and serving others through her career. Jamie is an Air Force veteran, who served 6 years active duty, including tours in Iraq and Korea. She was also stationed at Mt. Home and Lajes Air Force bases. After her service in the military, Jamie continued to serve her country as a civilian air traffic controller in Afghanistan. In 2012 upon returning home from Afghanistan, Jamie gained employment with the FAA at Southern California TRACON (SCT) in San Diego, California. She’s also been a NATCA member since her first day on the job. Although Jamie is from the Midwest, she settled into Southern California with ease and later met the love of her life, her wife Andrée. Just over 9 months ago, Jamie and Andrée were blessed with their beautiful daughter, Brièle.

Easily recognisable with his full head of dreads, you may know him from the East Coast music scene or through his work as a carpenter. Laurie is one of the most down to earth, fun-loving guys you will ever meet! Always smiling and making friends where ever he goes. In 2015 Laurie was diagnosed with a Stage 3 melanoma on his left calf. He had surgery to remove the melanoma, followed by a full lymph node dissection of his left groin. Laurie approached his melanoma diagnosis with the courageous and positive attitude that he is known for. He was able to return to work in 2016 and has had clear scans since. On Wednesday the 29th of August 2018, concerning symptoms led to a CT scan of Laurie’s head which revealed the devastating news that he had a large mass in his brain. Given his medical history Doctors immediately suspected that the mass was a secondary melanoma. He was transferred to the RPA in Sydney and underwent a craniotomy to remove the mass on Friday the 31st of August. Laurie’s operation went well and he was out of ICU within two days. On the ward Laurie quickly  began befriending other patients, their families and staff. Despite his own situation, Laurie spent the majority of his time in hospital cheering up others. Laurie and his family are very grateful for the wonderful care that he received during his stay at the RPA. Like any surgery a craniotomy carries serious risks and the speed of Laurie’s recovery astounded even his Neurosurgical team. However, sadly it turns out that the surgery was just the beginning of the challenges that lay ahead.The mass was not a metastatic melanoma as first suspected, it was a primary brain tumour. Worse still, it was a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive cancer that begins within the brain. Laurie has now started a 6 week course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy at the RPA. But despite these treatments the prognosis for GBM remains poor. Determined not to give up easily Laurie is looking at new treatment options that are currently only available overseas. Whilst promising, overseas treatments are extremely expensive and this combined with everyday living expenses has placed a huge burden on Laurie and his partner Rhianna, who in a cruel twist of fate got the keys to their first home on the same day he was diagnosed! So we are asking for your assistance as Laurie faces his biggest battle yet. Funds raised will go directly towards Laurie’s medical treatments, travel and living expenses. Please share this page so we can gather as much support for Laurie as possible in this time of need. He is a truly remarkable individual who continues to inspire those around him with his amazing strength and positive outlook on life.",8fc1a4bd65aabec864a3461a85e7eb81,26,0.1454,120.0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Katie is a talented teacher of tiny humans, a hilarious friend, and a caring sister - and this came as a complete shock. During the summer Katie found a lump in her left breast which a biopsy proved to be Stage 2 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma.  The day after her 36th birthday, she had surgery to remove the tumor that she’d dubbed “Earl” - after the Dixie Chicks’ seminal 90s hit “Goodbye Earl”. As the story goes, Earl had to die - and he did. However, during the surgery her doctors found that a suspicious mass in her right breast (named Felicia, as in “BYE”) was also cancer.  They also found a second Stage 2 tumor directly underneath Earl (we were too surprised about this one to give it a name). After a second surgery to check lymph nodes on her right side (all clear!) Katie is now tumor free and preparing to embark on the next stage of this wild journey - radiation treatment.Katie and her doctors had planned for traditional photon radiation treatment which would take place near her apartment in Chicago over four weeks.  This would have allowed her to continue to work and stay at home for the duration of treatment. However, when her doctor ran a simulation of treatment he found that photon treatment would deliver radiation to her heart which would increase her risk of developing chronic heart problems, dying of a heart attack, or developing secondary cancer later in life.  He asked a colleague to run a simulation with proton radiation, a newer technology that is more targeted and precise, which found that protons would deliver almost no radiation to her heart or lungs…but was only available a couple of hours away in Warrenville IL. Katie made a tough decision to take treatment with proton radiation and avoid the potential risks of photon treatment.Proton radiation is only available at about 22 locations in the United States and Katie’s treatment will involve commuting 1.5 hours to and from Warrenville five days a week for 6.5 weeks during a particularly gnarly Chicago winter.  She will also need to take a leave of absence from work and her beloved class while she is being treated.To support Katie in getting through this, we have set up this fund to help with her expenses.  Everything that is raised will be put toward covering the considerable cost of commuting, loss of salary during her work leave, and to defray other out of pocket costs associated with treatment.Please know that anything you can donate—even $5—will actively go toward helping my badass sister navigate this leg of treatment and allow her to focus on healing and moving forward to the next season of her life come springtime.",bf4a3cfcfbececc583cdecc7f9342525,15,2.3525,14.0,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

This wonderful gift she gave us kept Scott and our family going through the hardest of times, and sadly, these difficult times have returned.Scott's cancer is on the rampage and after multiple chemotherapy and radiation attempts the doctors have given up hope and we are fighting to keep hope alive.  Our main goal is to beat this cancer, but we are now in the financial woes of unpaid leave, so we are hoping to raise money to beat this cancer again. Scott is the most wonderful, gentleman, with a beautiful soul. A loving husband and totally committed father of three beautiful children, Madeleine, Sophia, and Nathanial. He has been fighting so hard to survive for so long, and has beaten the odds over and over again.  He is will do it again, but we know we need help.We are raising money for treatments, for living and for everything you can imagine, but my biggest desire is to see Scott grow old- He is only 46 years old, and he isn't done fighting.  Because he hasn't responded to the standard treatments, his doctors have absolutely given up on him. But we have not, and those who love him have not.  In fact, he has made it clear over and over again that quote ""If I have to die, I want to go out swinging!""  This is like his mantra. It is the sentiment my husband has had to repeat to the doctors a thousand times over the last two weeks.The doctors have no hope for Scott--exactly like three years ago- No hope at all.  We don't need the doctors hope though. We have our own and we have yours!  We believe in miracles and I cannot wait to have you watch this miracle occur again.Scott's story is really the perfect example of how GoFundMe can literally save a person's life.  The actual medicine that save Scott was not covered, so every single contribution went directly to paying for the medicines that have been saving him.Since 2015, Scott has shown that with the help of many, one person can beat even the greatest odds--Without the donations from so many amazing people, we would have never been able to financially survive this difficulty. It's also a great example of how once your doctor gives up on you, that you are really fighting more than just a disease.  We have spent two weeks begging for the right to fight.We have attempted the standard protocols for this cancer, but each failed--several chemotherapies and 18 rounds of Radiation.When the initial  chemotherapy was too toxic for Scott, we were left with looking for other treatments.  With a full liver metastasis, in July 2015, Scott had very little time, so while we met with genetic oncologist and waited on decisions for the next kind of chemo in the approved protocol, we decided to try THC Oil since Scott's epilepsy had been so benefited by CBD (Charlotte's Web), and we thought it couldn't hurt, and the Doctors agreed, in fact one said he believed that that may be one of the future CURES of cancer, not just symptom treatment, so we started a gram a day of the oil on August 1,  2015.  Within a month, the liver cancer had begun to regress, but the spread in his lymph system and peritoneal cavity marched on, so we continued forward with another chemotherapy.  This treatment was a failure in a huge way. By March 2016, Scott had completed 18 rounds of radiation on the football-sized tumor in his abdomen and sadly, this too was not effective, and after it all, he was still filled with cancer and he was recommended for hospice, with the caveat that we were going to try one more thing first.   While Scott was having the original cancer removed, I read this article. https://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2014/spring/mistletoe-therapy-cancer/   Helixor, a standard German Oncology treatment that is being studied in an FDA study at Johns Hopkins.While we battled using the conventional therapies and the THC Oil, we knew we were didn't have much hope left, but then in January 2016 we found a doctor who knew about the study and how to use mistletoe and could prescribe it. Then the Mistletoe Miracle began.  We began the treatment on April 1, 2016, and within just a few weeks, Scott's cancer began to regress.  While we only had hope at first, by the end of May scan, Scott's cancer had shrunk dramatically. The large visible lymph masses were gone in two weeks and he gained weight as he felt better every day. The cancer continued to shrink for two years, until he had just two slightly enlarged lymph nodes in his abdomen.  Then it came time to get more Helixor. We had not bought any in a long time because of the kindness of our GoFundMe folks and our family and friends allowed us to buy a years supply.  So we had not needed to reorder it. But then when we did, try to order it, we learned the FDA would not allow Helixor to ship to be shipped to America anymore.  We have not been able to get the medicine and Scott is getting sicker and sicker every day.His Scott's cancer has grown. He need constant care now and he wants to keep fighting. We are going to get him back on the treatment and will need to raise the funds, but those are just some of the roadblocks. Honestly, the biggest one is his oncologist retired and the new oncologist has no faith and says he has no hope.Scott has all the confidence in the world that he will beat this, and he wants to get back on the medicine that saved his life, but we are facing so many impediments.  No matter the challenges, though, no matter the many reiterations of futility, Scott wants a chance to beat this cancer back again.After all of these years of fighting against the illnesses that have tried to claim him, Scott knows he is NOT DONE fighting. As much as the oncologist thinks his case is hopeless, Scott is fully prepared to prove them wrong or ""go out swinging"" as he said.  As a 46 year old father of three, Scott has the right to fight, no matter how much they want him to give up!Please help us continue this journey.  Scott has done so much to survive almost thirty years of seizures that he is really not prepared accept defeat to this horrible disease. He has beaten the odds so far and would love to have the chance to keep on going.-Without the last three plus years of this support from all of you generous folks, Scott would not be here today to keep fighting.  Thank you all..BELOW IS THE ORIGINAL POSTING FOR THIS GOFUNDME THAT OUR SWEET DAUGHTER SET UP TO HELP HER DAD BEAT CANCER.   My dad, Christopher Scott Stephens, is an amazing man who has struggled for over twenty years with epilepsy--So they went to Colorado in November 2014 as Medical Marijuana Refugees.It was like a miracle. My dad finally found relief from seizures, immediately the frequency and severity of his seizures decreased. It was a miracle after being on five anti-epileptic drugs when we moved to Colorado!Things were looking up.Unfortunately, on May 22, 2015, my sweet dad was admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and the next day went into surgery to remove a tumor the size of a baseball from his colon. He was diagnosed with stage 3c Colon Cancer, and only  a couple weeks ago began his first round of chemotherapy. This cancer then progressed to Stage IV Colon Cancer, as it metastasized to my dad's liver.  As my dad, Scott, begins his fight against this disease, my family needs every bit of support they can get. I can't be there with them, but I want to try to rally support in whatever way I can.I want to ask you all to sending love and support to my family in this time of need.  We thank you so much for any help that can be offered, whether it is emotional or financial.  Your love and kindness are appreciated more than you will ever know.",6cd39ff767793c52bda595ffe6e0d88d,53,0.50028,1290.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Lisa was also Hugh's Room’s first publicist from 2001-2008, and has worked on management/publicity for the much missed Taylor Mitchell, Mose Scarlett, the Andrew Collins Trio, April Verch, Kiran Ahluwalia, Anne Lindsay, Qristina & Quinn Bachand, Jon Brooks, Enoch Kent, Jaffa Road, Art Garfunkel, ArtsCan Circle, a fundraiser for the Mariposa Folk Fest and a host of other wonderful artists in our midst.  Before working with musicians, she was communications coordinator at ARCH, a legal resource centre for persons with disabilities.Lisa is dealing with a recent diagnosis of aggressive HER2-positive breast cancer. She has had to scale back on her work at a time when her expenses are much higher dealing with all this. Her supplements and medicine, plus transportation to and from all her treatments and scans has made navigating this difficult journey even harder.  Lisa has been undergoing chemotherapy at Princess Margaret Hospital and is also working hard to boost her strength with a complementary care practitioner. The good news is that the cancer does not appear to have metastasized outside the breast and so we are all extremely hopeful for her recovery. She is one of the strongest people I know and is trying to stay positive through this ordeal.Lisa has dedicated so much love, time and energy to helping us and other musicians with our careers and we want to do what we can to give back. We hope that you may be able to make a donation to help ease this financial and emotional stress. The requested amount has been set to $1, because no amount is too small and would be appreciated more than you can know.

As the newest member of our family, her arrival was met with great joy by her older sister Davelyn and her mother Evelyne who felt this little princess completed her life. True to our family hopes, Derreon keeps very active and enjoys fun loving activities, taking keen interest in soccer ,swimming and sprinting. After a minor fall while playing on September 19, 2018, Derreon complained of stomach ache. As the pain rapidly got unbearable, she was taken to her pediatrician, who then quickly had her rushed  to the emergency room at the Novant Hospital in Haymarket VA. Upon arrival, the doctors immediately realized her condition was a lot more serious than previously thought. She was deemed critical and was therefore quickly airlifted to INOVA Children's hospital in Fairfax VA for specialist intervention.After spending several daunting hours at the E.R, the Doctors finally broke the heartbreaking news to us; she had stage 3 Cancer. They had discovered a large cancerous tumor covering approximately 75% of her left kidney. Derreon’s fall resulted in the rupture of this tumor, leading to severe internal bleeding and excruciating pain to this little 6-year-old girl. For four days, Derreon received specialist care that mostly involved getting internal bleeding under control. After 7 days in ICU and a biopsy, her doctors had a better insight to what specific cancer she had: Wilms’ Tumor. Wilms’ tumor is a rare kidney cancer that primarily affects children. Due to the advanced nature of Derreon’s cancer, an aggressive treatment approach was recommended. After 6 weeks of treatment that included chemotherapy, blood transfusion and strong dose medication, the tumor had shrunk enough in size to be removed surgically. The surgery lasted 9 hours but, in the end, the tumor,organs affected and all scared tissue around had been successfully removed. The joy of a successful surgery was short lived since we knew that post surgery treatment usually takes a greater toll on Cancer patients then pre-treatment. Derreon had a 40 weeks treatment plan and the surgery was just at week 8. Due to the spill of cancerous cells into her guts during the rupture, radiation therapy and another bout of aggressive chemotherapy treatment began soon after surgery. So far, Derreon has been strong and brave but like anyone else in her shoes, the disease has taken its toll. Typical side effects of cancer treatment such as blood, hair, weight and appetite loss were all too apparent. The severe pain she is in though is the worse side effect as it not only affects her but everyone around who loves and cares for her. After losing 16lbs, Derreon now weighs 21lbs and is being fed with a tube as sour gums and difficulty in swallowing wouldn’t allow mouth feeding as an option.This sad circumstance arises at a very bad time for  Derreon's family in general and Derreon's mother Evelyne in particular. Evelyne, a single mother of 15 year old Davelyn and 6 year old Derreon, is a sole proprietor business owner. Her business has been her only source of income for the past 15 years plus, as she personally works and manages it. With this unfortunate situation, she has been forced to shutdown her business to dedicate her time trying to be by her daughter's side as she fights for her life. To make matters worse, Evelyne just lost her kid brother, Edwin, in summer of 2018, and Evelyne and her 2 daughters had to make the painstaking and highly financially demanding trip to bury their brother/uncle, back in the village in Cameroon, Africa. 2 weeks upon their return, Derreon was diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer. Edwin had also been a source of financial support to Evelyne as they had worked together and the only father figure Derreon and Davelyne ever knew.Derreon is a true hero, a resilient and resolute  fighter engaged in the toughest fight of her life. She has a strong desire to overcome this disease but cannot do it own her own. She truly needs us for moral, emotional, spiritual and  financial support to help pay her very high medical and personal family expenses. With no income coming in and 2 children to take care of, Evelyne finds herself in a very tight position financially. We are humbly pleading for your kind and generous pledges/donations to help her during this tough time. Any contribution will go a long way as we stand by our little princess Derreon Keng. May the good lord replenish your generosity tenfold as we thank you in advance for your kindness.",4e1d788691b08c615d34b07a73db7d54,34,0.2343,18.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Right now she’s fighting Stage 3 breast cancer and just learned that she also has thyroid cancer. During the next seven months, Amy faces chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, lymph node removal, and thyroid removal. This will be followed by radiation treatment, radioactive iodine treatment, and hormone therapy to stop the cancer from returning.Here is Amy’s daughter, Sydney Davis. She was born with cystic fibrosis, a progressive, incurable, genetic disease that causes a thick sticky buildup of mucus in the lungs leading to persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time. Eventually it will lead to respiratory failure. The mucus caused by CF also hinders the pancreas from releasing digestive enzymes that allow the body to break down food and absorb vital nutrients. Each day, Sydney takes 30 pills. Each day, Sydney gives herself several breathing treatments to help clear mucus from her lungs. Each day--while the rest of us work, go to school, or care for kids--Sydney spends several hours doing things that will allow her to breathe. In addition to the daily care, she has endured six sinus surgeries, frequent hospital stays, and has had a G-tube placed for direct nutrition.This is Dale Davis, pictured here with the absolute loves of his life, Amy and Sydney. He and Amy have stood alongside and supported their daughter for 21 years as she fights cystic fibrosis. Now, Dale also stands alongside and supports Amy as she fights for her life too. Prior to receiving her cancer diagnosis, Amy had gone back to school full time to become an occupational therapy assistant after a 20+ career in accounting. She was thrilled to be going into a field that would allow her to provide hands-on help for others. Amy graduated in August. Instead of celebrating and embarking on a new career, she began her first round of chemotherapy.Sydney is a student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and studies how to teach others to use art to heal and cope. She was recently hospitalized for intensive CF treatment. During that time, not only was her mom unable to visit due to her compromised immune system, but her beloved therapy dog had to be put down. Sydney was forced to say goodbye to her best friend of 15 years via computer.Dale has worked at Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee for over 21 years. Ever since Amy went back to school, his has been the sole income for the family. The astronomical costs of Sydney’s lifetime of healthcare, tuition, hospital stays, Amy’s extensive cancer treatment, and his own health issues are becoming insurmountable. The amount of stress this all causes is beyond unimaginable. I am starting this GoFundMe campaign to raise money to help support the Davis family through these dark times. My hope is that by alleviating some of the financial burdens, this amazing family will be able to focus their energies on healing so that they can continue to live fulfilling, productive lives helping others.Thank you for reading the Davis’ story. Any financial support you can give will be appreciated more than you know. I encourage you to share their GoFundMe story with your friends, family and on social media.

He was quirky, unique in so many ways, and clearly material for a lifelong friend. That was the day I met Alejandro Mejia. It was eight years ago, and we had absolutely no idea what our future held. It seems that starting at that moment, Alejandro and I continued our paths in life together throughout the way. He is an excellent musician, showing all of us up in middle school and driving all of us to be at his level in high school. He is one of the most hard working people I know, keeping his priorities straight and his eye on his future. He is passionate, dedicated, honest, and careful. I discovered all of this when I was in sixth grade, but as he became my best friend, my fellow co-captain in drumline, and my fellow classmate to this day at Drexel, he has showed me over and over again I wasn't wrong about him -- he was genuine. If nothing else in his life showed his immense dedication to character, morals, and inner strength, it was his first battle with cancer this year. He stayed strong, positive, and focused on his future still, which surprised me because I knew I couldn't do it, but didn't surprise me because Alejandro never loses sight of what is most important to him. He is the most financially careful person I know. He washes his hands before every single meal, and stayed far away when we were sick. The reason Alejandro needs help is because, beyond explanation, his cancer has returned in another form. There are parts of life we will never understand as humans, and they are so disgusting that we don't know what to do. Why Alejandro is continuing to be bothered with this awful disease at such a young age is a question we can ponder forever, but I urge you to consider helping in a way I know we all can. I want you to just take a couple of seconds, and reflect on the issues you're struggling with right now. And I want you to take a look around the room and realize that despite those very real issues, you are able to get up and walk to the bathroom, you are able to eat whatever you choose, you are able to go to school, go to work, without putting your life on hold. You didn't beat cancer only for it to return again. Alejandro did. I'm starting a Go Fund Me for Alejandro because if nothing else, we can easily take a few moments from our day and provide him with monetary support, especially considering he is a full time student at an extremely expensive school. This awful disease unfortunately drains the monetary funds of those affected, which I find just awful, considering Alejandro's incredibly meticulous financial planning, almost to a point where I would get annoyed at him for not wanting to get food and spend money. Please, cancer will not stop Alejandro, I know that, but if we can help, we can make his time much, much easier. Thank you all very much, please consider sharing and donating to Alejandro Mejia for his second battle with cancer.",ba8dbd22d656912e3222a409b6831847,24,0.9884,14.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

We received the devastating diagnosis that she has an aggressive, locally advanced tumor involving large blood vessels.  Now, she is fighting for her life against Stage III pancreatic cancer and she needs help.My Mom’s StoryHer entire life my mother has been involved in protecting America and its citizens. And for as long as I can remember, my mother’s always been a fighter.  She graduated from the New York Military Academy, and soon after joined the U.S. Army.  After her 9 years in service in 5 operations, she continued to fight for her country as a U.S. Immigration Officer.  Then she was teaching Arabic and working for the Navy Postgraduate School.  My mom has done more in her life than most can imagine. Not only did she fight for her country, she fought for her family at home. She raised my sister and I, alone for the most part.  When we were in HS, my mom became a foster parent to take in our friends with family struggles; six HS girls stayed with us, all at different times. Besides the normal challenges faced by single mothers, she is also my sole caregiver and helps me daily with my permanent disabilities from a bout with meningitis when I was 14. These days she still continues to inspire by teaching K-3 and special needs children at a K-12 school in rural Nevada.  And for 3 months every summer, a rugged family who knows her as Claymore comes to build Burning Man. And she becomes the oil in this professional machine as a Black Rock Ranger, and makes herself available to anyone who needs her.  My mom also runs a project for combat veteran art therapy called Camp Hellnback.  What HappenedMy mother has had a long history of stomach problems, so it didn't seem to out of the ordinary when in March 2018, she was beginning to have some unfamiliar pains in her stomach and back. After trying to deal with this pain on her own, it was getting to be unbearable. In May, she went to see her Primary Care Provider at the VA, who offered a Gastroenterology consult two months later, but no pain relief.  After more weeks of enduring the pain, plus having additional symptoms; she went to the ER at the VA. There they found a mass in her pancreas in a CT.  She saw the GI doctor the next day who ordered an endoscopic ultrasound which the local VA doesn't do.  After weeks of waiting for her civilian appointment, again, she wound up in the ER; this time at Renown Medical Center in Reno, NV.A new CT at Renown reported ""fat-stranding adjacent to the pancreas,"" not a mass.  After being told that they didn't have any more tests to give her,  the admitting doctor offered her to stay and get morphine. My mom asked to be discharged to get back to work, with whatever pain medicine they wanted to give her and  she quickly became labeled a drug seeker.  Aside from never having any addiction problems or history with opiates, she has never had issues with any drug or alcohol, she never even smoked.  And again, she was left without pain relief.By mid July, she still had not received an appointment with a civilian GI doctor, and she pushed to be sent 6 hours away across state lines, to the VA in Palo Alto.  After multiple days of scans, blood tests, pokes and prods; we had the diagnosis of inoperable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The doctors described the tumor as ""locally-advanced,"" it has grown in and around her pancreas and has wrapped itself around her largest artery and vein which controls the blood supply to everything below the solar plexus.The Road AheadMy mom has always been independent and strong, constantly taking care of others while sometimes neglecting herself.  Above all else, my mom is resilient, strong, and positive in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Now, she’s facing another battle to win: cancer.We hope for the best side effects from the therapies she will be taking, but we are also preparing for the worst. Transitioning from a lifestyle of being the caregiver to one where she may need assistance with simple tasks like using the rest room and brushing her teeth is difficult for anybody, but especially her and our family. In addition to traditional chemotherapy and radiation, she also wishes to partake in holistic therapies, which are not covered by her insurance. We have been very fortunate to be offered a treatment plan at Stanford University, however we live over 6 hours drive away from where she would be treated.  And we found out that neither the veterans lodging nor the Fisher House will accept patients having long term chemotherapy.   So we need to spend money on hotels, for 3 days every other week in Palo Alto/Stanford, CA. Hotels cost an average of $130 and average rent is $3000, with basic treatments lasting between 3 and 6 months at the least . This one expense would be between $12,000 to $25,000. Given that we were just given this information days ago, the amount of the financial burden this disease will cause is still unfolding.  Due to a paperwork technicality, my mom doesn't qualify to receive donated leave, so she will be on Leave Without Pay for the entire time of treatment.  Besides trying to cover daily living costs, and lodging, we want to use every tool in the box, like natural therapies and eating healthy unprocessed meals. We will need to replace the funds used to care for me and add the cost to assist my mom at different stages, like needing a delivered meal plan. These amount to significant out-of-pocket costs that we can't cover. Because of our current family situation, I am the only family member available to care for my mom besides my sixty-eight-year-old grandmother.  In that sense, I'm lucky to be able to spend all my time caring for her.   I’ll be my mother’s primary caregiver in the months, and hopefully years to come.  We will need lots of assistive help and support, but I have been found too disabled to work.  And because I'm dealing with a daily symptom of nausea and vomiting, I can't drive and I often can't cook or brush my own hair and teeth.  Just like for her, it will  be the most difficult challenge I have ever faced, but one that I also consider an honor: being able to take care of the person who has protected and nurtured everyone around her through some of life’s roughest trials. My mom and I are the only family that live with each other, but without help from others, there is no way we could stay afloat. Though it's only been a few days since we learned this diagnosis, it's hard to see how we will go on.  But we will.This is why we need this blessing and our prayers to be answered. Any and all support is a gift and we will be grateful for everything positive that comes our way.  If you can share this gofundme to friends, groups, celebrities that would help this campaign off, that is a gift that could keep giving.

His chemotherapy cycles will be 3 days of treatment every 21 days.  Every cycle will affect him differently and they don’t know how his body will react, but they were told that he would likely feel like he had the “flu” on days 5-12, and his blood counts/immune system would be lowest on days 10-16.  Unfortunatley, Drew is unable to return to work for several months per his doctors orders! Andrew has a long road of extensive treatment and therapies ahead of him!!! For those that don't know Amanda and Andrew are expecting their 3rd baby (baby boy) :) at the end of July.  Amanda works as RN at Froedert Hospital and will continue to work as much as she can while attending appointments with Drew and trying to keep life as normal as possible for Aiden and Addison.  We are ALL cheering Drew on and have no doubt that he will beat this, but we know its not going to be easy!!  The Kelly family has had an overwhelming number of requests as to how they can help.

Spending our younger years together in Florida, we often visited the Keys; sometimes together and sometimes apart.   One of my favorite memories is of us there swimming, singing and dancing.  That was 2014, the year my son was born!After all the schooling, and all the hard work she fell in love.  She called me to say ""I'm getting married.""  She fell in love with Danny and his 4 children.  Now, along with her two children, they have 6.  She loves her new blended family as only someone like Jaime can do.   I remember thinking, after the long struggle of taking care of others and putting everyone else first, it was all coming together for her.  She was happy, in love, and living in a new home with a beautiful loving family!Shortly after that call I received another call with very different and unexpected news.  ""I have cancer,"" she said. Jaime is a nurse and understood the impact of such a diagnosis but forged forward with the courage and strength of a warrior.   Jaime was diagnosed with Angioimmunoblastic T Cell Lymphoma.  It  is a rare, and they say aggressive form of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma.  A cure for this type of cancer is not typical. The course of treatment was 6 rounds of chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant, but only if she could get into remission.  It was a difficult decision to go forward with the conventional protocol as the outcomes were not promising and she was raised in a holistically minded family.  After many sleepless nights and discussions with all the top medical professionals in and out of the area, she made the decision to go forward with chemotherapy.  We almost lost her after just the first round when the chest port became infected within days on being implanted.  She fought hard to come back after a stay in ICU and several more days recovering from a horrible infection in her blood.  Once recovered she went bravely through the other 5 rounds.  She had one more hospital stay for yet another infection, but she made it through somehow.After the third round she was cancer free!  What a celebration.  Then after the 6th and last round the cancer came back.  The celebration was short lived.  She didn't qualify for stem cell and was referred to another oncologist in Manhattan who referred her to an oncologist in Miami.  At this time she is getting another biopsy surgery and may qualify for a clinical trial.  We are not quite sure what the course of treatment going forward will be but we continue to remain hopeful that she will beat this! From the very beginning she has done everything in her power to improve and support her healing with all things healthy.  Her diet is organic and clean.  Her mother has a garden that has supported this effort from the start.  Unfortunately, the entire process has taken a toll on her and her family.  She's continues to work full time while battling this disease because she carries the health insurance and contributes greatly to the success of  her blended family.  Both the physical and financial impact has been great and many of the expenses continue to pile up.  This has been ongoing and she has been diagnosed less than 12 months ago. Time is of the essence.This is an aggressive cancer and one that requires a person to rest and regenerate.  THAT MEANS SHE NEEDS TO STOP WORKING NOW!  The conventional treatments aren't working and she really needs to seek alternative therapies.  Unfortunately, insurance doesn't cover many of those therapies or any of the expenses of missed work, extra travel expenses, and endless needs that a diagnosis like this entails.  THE TIME IS NOW! I'm asking for financial help to make her ongoing battle possible and perhaps a little less emotionally and physically taxing. This would allow her the time away from fulltime work and the financial help to pay medical expenses and to seek out a treatments that will extended her life.  She’s currently stage III and we continue to pray it doesn’t spread to her bones.  The goal for Jaime is to stop working and allow her body to rest and regenerate while seeking holistic and unconventional therapies.  We are sure that this will at the very least extend the time she will spend with her beautiful children, her family, and all the others that love and adore her.  This is only possible with the help and support of a community.Even though this is an aggressive cancer, she looks and feels otherwise healthy.  However, she doesn’t have a lot of time.  SHE NEEDS HELP NOW!  All donations will be used to get caught up on past due medical bills, stay ahead of the monthly household expenses and insurance premiums, and implement the most promising but costly alternative therapies.  Most importantly, it will allow for TIME to cuddle with her precious children.   This is a devastating diagnosis to face at any age, but at 39 and the mother of 6, its horrific!  No one should have to face it alone and without the support of a large and charitable community.  Jaime is a caring and selfless person.  She’s intense in love and kind to others.  She serves others and has an enthusiasm for the simple pleasures.   Her children, between the ages of 9 and 16, experience her joy and love and admire her deeply.  I’ve been honored to have this green eyed, red headed beauty as my best friend.  It is a tragedy that our lifetime friendship may not be as long as I’d hoped for.  So, please help in any way you can to give us all more TIME to love her, more TIME for her to love us, and more time for her to LOVE HERSELF!Thank you for your PRAYERS, LOVE & SUPPORT!",5da6880770e7f4cfbc1a4e17aa039f45,69,0.0343,390.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

We were both single parents, he has three children and I have two. Their ages at the time of his re-diagnosis ranged from 3 to 10. When we met, he was recovering from stage 3b colon cancer. He had completed surgery to remove part of his colon, radiation and chemotherapy. A month into our relationship, we found out he was cancer free, he lived cancer free for about a year, until a routine scan showed something in his lungs. There were a few spots in his lungs that they were keeping an eye on. When it seemed to look as they were growing, the oncologist decided to biopsy the largest spot. In November of 2014, a month after moving in together to become a blended family of 7,  we found out it was in fact cancer in his lungs. It is a metastasized spread of the colon cancer. There were 3 tumors in his lungs and one in his aorta, but now this number has grown to 6 tumors in his lungs. We are told that  they are inoperable.The oncologist has told us this disease is not curable. All treatment from this point on is about extending Mark's life. The 5 year survival rate for his cancer is 11.5%. The average life span of someone with this cancer is 2 years. We want to defy those odds.There is a new radiation treatment called stereo tactic radiation which Mark tried last year to shrink the original 4 spots.  The treatment did shrink the four spots they radiated, but now they have detected 3 new tumors.He is off work and trying to make ends meet for the family while going through this treatment.Mark is also wanting to try some alternative treatments through naturopathic doctors to try and cure or manage this cancer so he can try to live a normal life for as long as possible and be there for our five children. Naturopathic treatments are not covered by medical and are very expensive. Mark currently relies on his disability insurance as we support all five of our children, but his coverage is only half of his previous income. Donations will help ease the financial stress of keeping a family of 7 afloat and allow him to not get further into debt, trying to provide for his children and trying to afford medical expenses. We are also now seeking donations to cover the cost of a clinical trial that is being done in California. Mark’s oncologist would like to send him down there to receive treatment in hopes of possibly getting rid of the cancer completely. Mark also would like to try to travel while he is well because with an incurable illness, we do not know what the future holds.We hope to find a cure so he can be the father and partner he wants to be. I love him very much and he has a large family who love and adore him.Thank you!Update: Mark did stereotactic radiation a few years ago but developed radiation pneumonitis from this. This is inflammation of his lungs that makes him very sick and weak. He had to take steroids to overcome the radiation pneumonitis, but these steroids have come with many side effects including anxiety, difficulty sleeping and personality changes. This made life very challenging for the entire household.￼￼￼￼￼Words cannot express how thankful we are for your support. Update: Mark did treatment with a new drug the year prior to last. He is off of it now as the side effects were quite severe. He is currently on two different types of chemotherapy 1) oral pills he takes every day for two weeks, then one week off, and 2) IV chemo at Lions Gate Hospital every three weeks. He has been on this regiment for a year now, which as you can imagine, is quite hard on him. ￼￼￼￼￼￼",ebd0eb255ffab77d628fe134967125ca,32,0.3734,1440.0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Je m'appelle Marcel et j'ai besoin d'aide pour empecher Alina de périr de son cancer. Alina est présentement en convalescence apres sa deuxième chirurgie. Il ne s'agit qu'un court répis avant l'inevitable retour du cancer et je vous demande de l'aide pour empecher cette terrible maladie de tuer Alina. Elle a besoin de passer un test de genome, qui n'est pas encore couvert par la Régie d'asurrance maladie, ni par aucune de nos deux assurances privées. Ce test permettra d'identifier un traitement qui pourrait sauver la vie d'Alina. Nous avons très peu de temps. (Photo 2: Alina à l'été 2017, quelques jours avant d'apprendre qu'elle a un cancer de stade 4)NOTRE HISTOIREC'était le 2 juillet 2017 et un voyage de quelques jours en famille était  planifié. Le matin du départ, Alina se plaignait de ne pas se sentir bien. Ça faisait quelques semaines qu'elle avait une congestion nasale, avait des maux de tête fréquents et se sentait fatiguee. Quelques fois elle était étourdie. Elle essayait de rester forte en nous disant qu'il n'y avait rien d'anormale. C'est facile à croire, car nous sommes une famille avec 4 enfants, où les deux parents travaillent à temps plein. Quelques semaines avant nos vacances improvisées, Alina avait deja consulté un docteur generaliste dans une clinique locale. Malheureusement, le médecin avait mal diagnostiqué le cancer, en pensant qu'elle avait une sinusite. Il lui a prescrit des antibiotiques, sans autre suivi. Malgré que le temps passait, je trouvait bizarre qu'il n'y avait aucune amélioration de sa condition et les sympthomes persistaient. Je me suis dit qu'il serait bon de consulter avant de prendre la route des vacances. Nous sommes allés a l'urgence.Le 2 juillet 2017, notre monde fut bouleversé. Malgré toutes les apparances d'une personne en excellente forme physique et ses habitudes de vie saines, une tumeur massive envahissait ses sinus et s'était étendu dans la lobe frontale de son cerveau. La tumeur était tellement avancée que 40% de son cerveau était dans l'oedème. De plus, ses tests de sang étaient alarmants: le niveau de sodium était si bas qu'elle était à risque de périr sur le champ. Le médecin de l'urgence était sans équivoque, “Je ne sais pas comment elle peut être encore vivante”. immédiatement il l'a envoyé en ambulance à l'Institut neurologique de Montréal. Le stress et une nuit sans sommeil ont aggravé l'état d'Alina. Le lendemain Alina a commencé à avoir des problèmes de language apparents: pointant confusément une chaise, elle l'appellait Kraft Dinner, meme si elle comprenait qu'elle n'utilisait pas le bon mot. Ensuite, elle a commencé a confondre les 4 langues qu'elle parlait. Après l'administration de puissantes doses de cortisoides, elle est redevenue elle-même. Mais il y avait un prix à payer! Des effets secondaires du medicament sont l'anxiété, l'insomnie, la prise de poids. Elle n'a pas pu dormir une seule nuit complète pour plusieurs mois suivants. Avec l'arrêt de son système hormonal naturel, elle a prit 60 livres en quelques semaines. Sans parler des sauts d'humeur dans lequel se trouve une personne qui recoit une dose correspondant à 400 fois le niveau d'adrénaline normal!Première semaine à l'hôpital, nous étions sous choc total. Nous n'étions pas en mesure d'absorber l'information nous-mêmes, encore moins de la faire comprendre à nos enfants. Au début, les médecins n'étaient pas certains qu'ils pourraient traiter ce cancer. Le pronostic était très mauvais. Mais comme Alina était jeune, autrement en parfaite forme physique et serait en mesure de soutenir un traitement très agressif, il a été décidé qu'ils tenteraient de retirer la tumeur. Quel soulagement ! Nous avions espoir, même si le chirurgien ORL nous avait annoncé les resultats de la biopsy avec les mots, “C'est un cancer horrible, horrible, horrible!!!”. La pathologie indiquait une forme très avancée de Sinonasal Undifferentiated Carcinoma (SNUC) avec 10% de Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC). Non seulement malignes, ces types sont très agressifs et métastasiques. De stade 4, le dernier stade de développement des cancers, le chemin normal aurait normalement été vers les soins palliatifs.LES ÉPREUVESLe plan de traitement était multi-modal et intensif: 3 cycles de deux chimiothérapies simultannées sur une période de 9 semaines, une chirurgie cranio-faciale, suivie par 6 semaines de radiothérapie combinée à plus de chimio. C'était très éprouvant physiquement et émotionnellement, mais Alina a toujours gardé le morale et a réussi à passer à travers. (Photo 3: Chimiothérapie en cours, mais les grosses doses de steroids provoquent une faim intense)Le 5 septembre 2017, quelques jours seulement après sa dernière chimiothérapie, j'ai eu la peur de ma vie. En route vers le Centre du Cancer du West Island, Alina a eu une crise dans la voiture. Son coeur et sa respiration se sont arrêtés. Je l'ai retirée de l'auto sur le bord de l'autoroute et  fait les manoeuvres de reanimation, en attendant les secours. Après quelques minutes, son coeur battait et j'entendait une faible respiration. Rien au monde ne pouvait me preparer à vivre un moment comme celui-là. J'ai eu peur de perdre Alina comme jamais auparavant. Une fois rendu à l'hôpital, je me suis effondré. Plusieurs semaines de thérapie m'ont été nécessaires avant que je puisse reprendre cette route. Je pleurais comme un bébé chaque fois que je traversais cet endroit dans mon itinéraire. Deux semaines plus tard Alina subissait la chirurgie cranio-faciale. Il ne pouvait y avoir aucun délai entre les traitements, car le cancer combattait en retraite mais ne manquerait aucune opportunité pour revenir aussitôt que la chimio serait évacuée. Les Dr Petrecca et Dr Richardson et leur collegues ont réussi une chirurgie exceptionnellement difficile, de manière à dépasser toutes les attentes, même les leurs. Plusieurs dangers étaient presents: changements dans la personalité, perte de language, problèmes de motricité, risque de perdre l'oeil gauche, etc. La chirurgie était planifiée pour une durée de 16 heures. C'est très long dans une salle d'attente, je vous le jure. Quand j'ai finalement pu voir Alina dans la salle de réveil, avec ses deux yeux, sa personalité intacte et aucun changement notable au niveau de son contrôle langagier, j'étais rien de moins qu'en extase. (Photo 4: Quelques semaines après la chirurgie cranio-faciale)La troisième phase du plan de traitement a commencé le jour d'Halloween. Elle était exposée quotidiennement à la radiation pendant 6 semaines d'affilé. Après deux semaines, elle n'était plus en mesure de manger, ni de marcher. En surmontant ses effets néfasts, elle a réussi à se rendre à la fin des traitements et elle a sonné la cloche symbolique pour le signaler, en me rendant très fier.Son équipe médicale était alors confiante que les traitements avaient été un succès. Alina commencait sa lente, mais graduelle et constante récupération. Pendait 9 mois, elle était libre de cancer.UN NOUVELLE EMBUCHE Malheureusement, à la fin de 2018, le cancer s'est pointé de nouveau. La nouvelle nous a dévastés. Après tout ce qu'Alina avait déjà traversé, l'idée de faire des nouveaux traitements semblait plus difficile à digérer que jamais.La bonne nouvelle, la deuxieme chirurgie était aussi un succès: la tumeur a été enlevée. La mauvaise, c'est que les chirurgiens ont  trouvé des cellules pré-cancereuses. Selon notre oncologue, avec ce type de cancer, la chance d'une nouvelle récidive serait de 100%.(Photo 5: Alina maintenant. En pleine récupération. Toujours souriante)Ayant épuisé le recours à la chimio et la radiothérapie, les options pour traiter le retour du cancer sont limitées. UN NOUVEL ESPOIRNotre espoir repose sur l'utilisation d'un test de genome qui localise les mutations de cellules causant la tumeur pour qu'un anti-corp sur mesure soit fabriqué pour détruire les gênes déffectueux. En somme, ceci aurait comme effet d'éliminer d'emblé les thérapies qui n'ont pas de chance de succès et pointeriat notre équipe vers les solutions les plus adapteés. Cette technologie est recente, elle date de moins d'un an et elle est disponible seulement aux États-Unis. La Régie de l'assurance maladie ne couvre pas les frais. Nos assurances santé privées non plus. Le test (FoundationOne Cdx) à lui seul coûte plus de 6 000 USD. (Photo 6: Nos enfants)CE QUE VOUS POUVEZ FAIREDepuis le début des traitements, les medecins d'Alina ne l'ont pas autorisée de retourner travailler. Je fais de mon mieux, mais étant l'aidant naturel d'Alina et parent à temps plein, j'ai du réduire de beaucoup mes heures de travail. La réalité est telle que nous avons utlisé toutes nos réserves financières et avons maintenant besoin de votre aide afin de pouvoir payer son test de genome.

My name is Marcel and I need your help to stop this cancer from taking Alina.Alina is currently recovering after her second surgery. This is only a short respite before the inevitable return of cancer and I ask for your help to prevent this terrible disease from killing Alina.She needs to have a Genomic Test, which is not yet covered by our Public Health Insurance, nor by our private insurance company. This test will help identify a treatment that could save Alina's life. We have very little time.(Photo 2: Summer 2017 : Days before learning she has a stage 4 Cancer)OUR STORYIt was July 2, 2017 and we had planned on leaving on a family trip. On the morning of departure, Alina complained that she was not feeling well. For some time, she had nasal congestion, frequent headaches and felt tired. Sometimes she was dizzy. She was trying to stay strong, telling us that there was nothing wrong. Being in a family with 4 children where both parents work full time makes that easy to believe.A few weeks prior, Alina consulted a general practitioner at a local clinic. Unfortunately, the doctor misdiagnosed the cancer, thinking she had sinusitis. He prescribed antibiotics without further follow-up.Time passed. I found it odd that her condition did not improve and the symptoms persisted, if they were not getting worse. I thought it would be good to consult before taking the road of holidays. We went to the emergency room.On July 2, 2017, our world was turned upside down. Despite all appearances of a person in excellent physical shape leading a healthy lifestyle, a massive tumor had invaded her sinuses and spread into the frontal lobe of her brain. The tumor was so advanced that 40% of his brain was in edema. Her blood tests were alarming: the sodium level was so low that she was at risk of sudden death.The emergency doctor was unequivocal, ""I do not know how she can still be alive."". He then rushed her by ambulance to the Montreal Neurological Institute.Stress and a sleepless night aggravated Alina's condition. The next day Alina began to have language problems: confusingly pointing to a chair, she called it Kraft Dinner, although she understood that she was not using the right word. Then she started to confuse the 4 languages she speaks.After administering powerful doses of dexahematosone (steroids), she became herself again. But there was a price to pay! Side effects of this drug are anxiety, insomnia, weight gain. She could not sleep a single full night for the next several months. With the stopping of her natural hormonal system, she took 60 pounds in just a few weeks. Did I mention the mood swings in a person who receives a dose corresponding to 400 times the normal level of adrenaline!First week in the hospital, we were under total shock. We were not able to absorb the information ourselves, much less explain it to our children. At first, the doctors were not sure they could treat this cancer. The prognosis was very bad. But since Alina was young, otherwise physically fit and would be able to support a very aggressive treatment, it was decided that they would try to remove the tumor.What a relief ! We had hope, even as the ENT surgeon read the biopsy report and exclaimed, ""It's a horrible, horrible, horrible cancer !!!"" The pathology indicated a highly advanced form of Sinonasal Undifferentiated Carcinoma (SNUC) with 10% Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC). Malignant. Extremely aggressive. Metastasic. Worst of all, it was evaluated to be Stage 4, the last stage of cancer development. The normal path would have been towards palliative care.THE LONG AND WINDING ROADThe treatment plan was multi-modal and intensive: 3 cycles of two simultaneous chemotherapies over a period of 9 weeks, cranio-facial surgery, followed by 6 weeks of radiotherapy combined with more chemo.It was physically and emotionally gruelsome, but Alina kept a postive attitude and managed to get through it.(Photo 3: Chemotherapy in progress, but large doses of steroids cause intense hunger)On September 5, 2017, just days after her last chemotherapy, I faced the fear of my life. On our way to the West Island Cancer Center, Alina had a seizure in the car. Her heart and breathing stopped.I pulled her out of the car on the edge of the highway and did CPR while waiting for help. After a few minutes, her heart was beating and I heard her breathe, faintly. Nothing in the world could prepare me for a moment like this. I was afraid of losing Alina like never before. Once at the hospital, I collapsed. Several weeks of therapy were necessary before I could take this route again. I cried like a baby every time I crossed this place in my itinerary.Two weeks later, Alina underwent cranio-facial surgery. There could be no delay between treatments. The cancer was stunned, but would not miss any opportunity to start growing again as soon as the chemo would lose its effect.(Photo 4: A few weeks after craniofacial surgery)Dr. Petrecca and Dr. Richardson and their colleagues perofrmed an exceptionally difficult surgery, exceeding all expectations, even theirs. The dangers of such of a surgery were multiple: changes in personality, loss of language skills, motor problems, risk of losing the left eye, etc.The surgery was planned to last approximately 16 hours. When you're in a waiting room, that is an eternity! When I finally saw Alina in the recovery room, with her two eyes, her personality intact and no noticeable change in her language control, I was nothing short of ecstatic!The third phase of the treatment plan began on Halloween. For 6 weeks in a row, she was exposed daily to radiation. After two weeks, she was no longer able to eat or walk. Overcoming the pain and the side-effects, she made it to the end and rang the bell reserved for those who make it to the end of their treatment plan. I was very proud. Her medical team was confident that their interventions were successful. Alina began her slow, but gradual and steady recovery.For 9 months, she was free of cancer.IT'S BACKAt the end of 2018, the cancer came back. The news was devastating. Alina had already gone through so much. The idea of going through more medical interventions was much more difficult to accept.Good fortune and talented surgeons to blame, the second surgery was also a success: the tumor was removed. On the bad side, the surgeon found pre-cancer cells in the surrounding area. According to our oncologist, with this type of cancer, the chance of a new recurrence coming from those faulty cells is close to 100%.(Photo 5: Alina now in full recovery, always smiling)Having exhausted our recourse to chemo and radiotherapy, the modalities available for treating a new recurrence are limited.A NEW HOPEOur hope lies in using genomic testing, which can locate the mutation causing the tumor, so that an antibody can be created to match that mutation, to bind to the mutated gene and inactivate it, thus suffocating the tumor. This would have the effect of eliminating from the outset therapies that have no chance of success and point our team to the most appropriate solutions.This technology is recent, it is less than a year old and is available only in the United States. The Public Health Program in Quebec does not cover expenses. Our private health insurance has also declined paying for it. The test (FoundationOne Cdx) alone costs more than $ 6,000.(Photo 6: Our kids)WHAT YOU CAN DOAlina is no longer able to work and I am doing my best to keep things going, but being Alina's caregiver and full-time parent, I've also had to reduce my work hours. The reality is that we have used up all our financial reserves and now need your help to pay for the genome test.We ask you to give what you can.

 September last year my sister had two large tumours removed from her right ovary (12cm & 7cm). The tumours came back as borderline mucinous tumours (pre cancer). The best method to prevent it from turning to cancer was to remove the right ovary. Stacee and her husband were ready to take on 2019 and get everything back on track after all of the time taken off work unpaid. Then after receiving a call from the hospital to go in for an appointment with my husband they were told that she now has ovarian cancer stage 1c. 

As you can imagine, this has come as a devastating shock to us. Stacee will undergo a 3rd surgery on 14th March (date TBC) for a full hysterectomy, remaining ovary and omentum as ovarian cancer can spread without detection very quickly. 

Once the pathology reports comes back then it will be determined if chemotherapy if is required. To follow on from surgery, stacee will have to have 8 weeks or more of recovery from work (as well her husband a few weeks as a carer), hormone therapy due to surgical menopause and possibly chemo. 

With no children of her own before Stacee has surgery, she is considering freezing embryos (pending funds). This of course comes with some initial costs (Repromed pay for it due to the illness which is amazing but there will day surgery, anaesthetists and ongoing costs and everything is happening so fast it’s all very overwhelming. 

With your help, we are hoping to ease some of the financial stresses Stacee and her husband face over the coming months. Unfortunately, with a myriad of appointments and 2 surgeries already, Stacee has already exhausted her sick leave and annual leave left to see her through what will be a difficult few months ahead. 


All contributions, no matter how big or small are appreciated beyond any of us can ever put into words. All funds will go directly to Stacee so all medical and other personal costs can be taken care of as she will be out of work for quite some time post surgery. 


Any funds that are not utilised will also be donated to the Ovarian Cancer Organisation Australia. 

We pray stacee will fight this and come out on top, like most of her fights in the ring. She can not wait to get back into sport and her normal lifestyle.

She’s had successful times, followed by lean times. But throughout, Meghan has thrived on being around other artists and contributing to the performing arts, her true passion.In mid-October, 2018, Meghan suffered odd, sporadic symptoms, including swelling in her face and fainting spells. Many tests and E.R. visits later and suddenly Meghan was given the diagnosis:  Mediastinal B-cell Lymphoma, in the form of a 9cm tumour in her chest cavity.The good news is that this is absolutely treatable, but not without a “helluva” fight ahead of her. That’s why we’re asking for your help.With barely time to process or make plans, Meghan has remained in hospital and has had to start treatment immediately. This includes six rounds of strong chemo drugs for five or six days in a row with only a couple of weeks' break in between sessions. Her immune system will be highly compromised. The doctors have said that due to the intensive treatment schedule and expected side-effects, she will not be able to work or travel for up to a year, impacting  her ability to pay rent, utilities and groceries, in addition to transport for her many doctor and hospital appointments... Therefore, we are asking you to contribute what you can so that Meghan can get better and return to work as soon as possible. Meghan has a loving and supportive network of friends and family both in Canada and New York including siblings Matthew, Valerie, Laura and Edward and her step-father, Mike, along with Meghan’s mother Rhona who has temporarily relocated to NYC.  Meg’s step-mom Janice will also travel from Canada to be there whenever she can to help in Meghan’s recovery.  She is surrounded by so much love from so many, including that of her extended (and extensive)  Rochefort family.Meghan is a strong and feisty young woman, which is why we know that she will kick ass and come out of this ordeal an even stronger individual and  back to normal life without the added stress of an insurmountable financial burden awaiting her. We want to help her get there, healthy and whole.She will do it!  She just needs your help to get her through this really hard part!  We humbly and gratefully invite you to donate to Meghan's Go-Fund-Me.  All donations will go directly to Meghan to help with medical bills, treatment costs and basic living expenses. We thank everyone who has been there to offer their love and support and for the many acts and words of kindness Meghan has received. We ask you to donate whatever you can to help her get through this difficult time and on behalf of Meghan and her family, we send our heartfelt love, gratitude and appreciation.",9222a8d7143a4b9df423dd9256bf12df,20,0.48302,90.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

The doctor came back with the terrible news that he had severe kidney cancer, stage 4. He had to have surgery immediately to remove the tumor (which took up his entire kidney) as well as the thrombus (blood clot) that grew from his kidney up into his heart.Since then, the road to recovery has been more like an obstacle course—he’s been to the ER twice, had abdominal swelling from fluid buildup that needs to be drained, which is costly, and because he’s been unable to work, the bills have been piling up. He has some potentially cancerous nodules in his lungs that spread from the kidney cancer, which require costly treatments.Yesterday (11/23), I took him to the ER because he was barely able to move and had trouble breathing. He’s stable now, and all we know is that he’s been bleeding internally. He only had 4.5 pints of blood in his body, while the average person should have 11.My dad is the strongest person I know. Before he got sick, I used to tell people that he was the youngest person I know, despite becoming a father (to me) at 45. He would go to the gym twice a week and work out. He designs and builds furniture and cabinets, but has been unable to work.He’s one of the people I love most in the world; I grew up with a love for art, nature, and milkshakes because of him. He used to braid my hair because he had long hair in the 70s. I’ve lived with him for the past 2 ½ years and most nights were spent cooking, watching TV, and laughing together. Everyone he knows loves him for his sense of humor, lightheartedness, and open-mindedness.The point of saying all this is that he’s hurting and needs help, and he is so deserving of help. The doctors are doing what they can to treat him, but besides that, the help he needs is financial. He needs to pay for tests, medications, treatment, debt from the surgery, rent, food, etc. Please donate to help.If you can’t afford to donate right now, please share this link or keep him in your thoughts and prayers. My dad is a big advocate for the power of prayer, and I know it would make him feel so happy to know that people out there are caring about him and thinking about him.

Just in the past couple years, as her husband Roger has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, Laura has stepped up as both his caretaker and full-time provider for their family. She is also a great mom to their sixteen year old daughter, Amy, as she navigates the high school years. Despite the time, love, and effort she commits to Roger and Amy, Laura still manages to fit in meaningful time with her adult children and grandkids. She loves Jesus, intentional connection with friends, and time spent in Creation on horseback… she’s always been an example servant and makes the most of her life. As if her plate was not full enough, we all watched in awe as she gracefully overcame a terrifying diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (squamous cell) in the fall of 2017. After a successful surgery to remove the cancer, Laura picked up right where she left off— caring for Roger, working, being a mom & grandma, and spending time in nature. A clean cancer scan in April 2018 confirmed that she should indeed keep living her life as usual.However, everything came crashing down this holiday season. After navigating some mysterious leg pain for many months over the fall, Laura learned on December 30th that her cancer is back in her lung and has metastasized to her leg; the flip from “Remission” to “Stage IV” felt almost instantaneous.Laura and her family are now living on disability, which ends in October. Instead of being able to care for her dependents and earning a living, much of her time is now devoted to getting scans, sitting in waiting rooms, and receiving bleak news at every turn.At this point, Laura has a drain in her left calf to address the fluids that the cancer is creating (which was part of the mysterious pain and causing the leg to swell). The only course of treatment offered for her cancer is the drug Crizotinib, which, despite the optimism with which it was presented, has been accompanied by a shocking 1-3 year survival rate. Every other treatment and option discussed with her doctors has either been taken off the table or was not considered an option to begin with.Laura’s “Hail Mary” lies in pursuing the cutting-edge treatment offered through Issels Medical Center. While some of the diagnostics may be covered by insurance, the heft of the cost is not. Laura has felt that God is starting to open doors to this treatment in spite of others having closed. We are praying that we can bless her with the opportunity to receive this treatment, and that miraculous healing will be seen through the experience...and your love, prayers, and support! Please donate as you feel led, and join us in fighting for the life of our mother, wife, sister, and friend.Thank you for your generosity!Laura is posting updates on her battle at CaringBridge.org.

Jerry, 55, was diagnosed with stage 4 poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The primary site was in the lung, with metastasis to the lymph nodes and then doctors also found 11 lesions on the brain. Immediately, Jerry could no longer work. He is a driver by trade and now he has found himself out of work & needing to apply for disability (which is half of what he normally brings in). Almost overnight, this young family’s world has just been turned upside down. The diagnosis is devastating enough, but now they also find themselves in dire need financially. Jerry is the breadwinner in the family. In addition to stressing about how they will pay for the cancer care, they have bills & a mortgage to pay and have no idea how they are going to make ends meet. They have been told that a single dose of chemo is $30,000. Although Jerry has insurance, they still have deductibles to meet and still have to pay a huge portion of that. The thought of that, is completely overwhelming for a family that has barely any income coming in now.Jerry began his cancer battle with radiation to first address the brain lesions before doctors could even begin to address his inoperable lung tumor. There is a ray of hope in all of this. Jerry was tested for and found out that he is a candidate for a new cutting edge procedure called immunotherapy. Only 1 in 5 are eligible to try it and he was lucky enough to qualify as a candidate. This treatment could potentially help him fight the cancer from the inside out and hopefully will give him the shot he needs to fight this cancer and God willing, eventually go into remission. After a battle with his insurance company who at first refused to assist in paying for said treatment, Jerry began the immunotherapy treatments and has been diligent with these treatments every few weeks for the last few months. It has been tough the last few months with bouts of nausea, diarrhea and weakness and multiple medications. After two pet scans, it appears the immunotherapy is working! The original brain lesions are shrinking. Unfortunately however, this past Monday, Jerry had an emergency MRI after suffering a  new bout of dizziness, disorientation & headaches. Although the immunotherapy is  shrinking the original brain lesions, two new lesions have now appeared. Jerry needs to continue the immunotherapy & now address additional medication & alternate treatment for the new lesions. To top this all off, the insurance company will no longer cover Jerry (or his family) after July unless they purchase the insurance through COBRA. The insurance company will require Jerry to pay $600 a month just for his insurance (COBRA) & that doesn’t even include the rest of the family! Jerry & Debbie are beside themselves. They are in no position financially to do this. The bills are pouring in & they are falling behind quickly. In addition to insurance & new treatment, they also need to continue the immunotherapy which is extremely expensive ($15,000 each round). This treatment is Jerry’s greatest chance to prolong his prognosis & potentially save his life. Without it, he might not survive.They have 4 children aged 12-22. Their two oldest sons are attending college. They also have two young daughters, one in high school and the youngest just in 7th grade. All are still living at home and depend heavily on Mom & Dad. If any of you could find it in your heart to contribute to this cause, or help in any way, you would be making a huge difference in the life of this family. They would be eternally grateful. Their future depends on the kindness of others who can help alleviate some of the worry & stress of this crippling diagnosis as well as its financial repercussions.

Physically, emotionally, and financially families suffer.  In late 2017, our Dad, Doug, was very ill and underwent multiple surgeries and testing before he was diagnosed with terminal cancer called Multiple Myeloma.First a little about Doug:  Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois he moved to Florida with our mom in 1978 when they went on their honeymoon and never returned to the cold.  He is a father of four and grandfather of three.   He loves his family, Turner Classic Films, The God Father, Notre Dame football, The Blackhawks, The White Sox and The Tampa Bay Buccaneers (one for FL! ) On May 29, 2018 he received his terminal diagnosis.  Multiple Myeloma causes cancer cells to accumulate in the bone marrow where they crowd out healthy blood cells.   This eliminates the ability to create healthy antibodies and for the body to self-cure causing infection in the entire bloodstream. Multiple Myeloma cannot be cured, and he will live out the rest of his life with this illness. He started chemotherapy on June 15th and has been undergoing strenuous treatments weekly since diagnosis. These treatments have taken its toll on his body and mind.  Unfortunately, the treatments were not working as the Doctors and Oncologist had predicted.On February 8 he will undergo a Bone Marrow Transplant that will leave him hospitalized for at the minimum 30 days if all things go perfectly with zero complications. At this time Doug will need to have 24-hour care under his primary caregiver, our mom, Laura resulting in both of them being unable to work. All in all, there is a long hard road ahead of all of us but our Dad is a fighter and he has a strong team of family and friends behind him every step of the way. That said, the financial burden is daunting as insurance can only cover so much. These debts weigh heavy on his heart and mind making the ability for him to concentrate on getting well and beating this cancer difficult and he is instead plagued by thoughts of financial responsibility. Doug is not one to ask for any assistance. He is a very proud man who has always paid his own way and took care of those around him.

More than an African Elephant every single day.  I am doing this to show my support to my parents, to feel extremely uncomfortable and sore to somewhat empathize with the pain they feel daily.  The mental battle of the challenge will be a major focus and having to keep going no matter pain or problems that will arise within the challenge.Cancer is such a shit and horrendous disease  and everyone most likely knows someone who has been impacted by it directly or indirectly. My Parents are both currently suffering from this awful disease and have had to change a lot of the things they would normally do to better accommodate their appointments and also depending on how they feel on the day. My Mother in law also has had several battles with cancer including one recenlty that she came out victorious against.  Her husband as well has had major family losses to the disease. Cancer is something that always makes you wish you could do something more for your loved ones when you hear that this has happened to them. You want to take that pain away from them and show them you'll always be there for them!The money raised over the course of this challenge will go  towards cancer research at Curtin University so i know that all the money that is donated will go directly into the hands of the people trying to fight this disease.The challenge will also be helping me to get over to do the Kokoda track in PNG. Kokoda is something that my dad had always wanted to do but is unable to do so now  (although he would tell you he's fine and could do it anyway ). The full track is 96KM of grueling mountain ranges and dense jungle and is a major part of Australia's WW2 history in the defense against the advancing Japanese army in 1942. The physical and mental nature of the track will be a massively grueling challenge but something i look forward to.Any donations you guys make will be greatly appreciated and i would really appreciate anything you can help with.",75503c462eef285e2b54bb20ed872010,14,0.095,120.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Doctors diagnosed his condition as inflammation of the hip socket, and prescribed a regimen of exercises to improve his condition. However, Jason’s pain escalated through July, leading to an MRI (at his request). On August 3, Jason and Stephanie received the startling MRI results: a large, 10cm x 10cm x 9cm tumor resided in the left side of Jason’s pelvis. This discovery launched several weeks of tests to determine the exact nature of the tumor. Those weeks were a whirlwind of activity, even as Jason’s pain began to spike to excruciating and debilitating levels. There were Emergency Room visits, doctor appointments, and more tests. While Jason suffered, Stephanie was due to give birth to their third child on August 13 via C-section! Despite his pain and difficulty walking, Jason was determined to accompany Stephanie to the hospital to witness the birth of baby Jude. On the morning of the C-Section, as Stephanie and Jason sat in the prep room, Jason’s pain spiked to an extreme level, forcing them to make a truly gut-wrenching decision: Jason was not fit to be in the operating room with Stephanie and their new son. Instead, hospital personnel rushed him on a gurney to the Emergency Room to receive several rounds of IV pain-killers to bring him out of agony. Both Stephanie and Jason mourn the fact that he spent the birth of their third son alone in the ER.The “C” WordOn Monday, August 20 (one week after Jude’s birth), the Le Shana family received more devastating news: Jason’s tumor was a rare and aggressive form of cancer, called sarcoma. Only about 1% of all cancer cases are classified as sarcomas, and there are dozens of sub-types. Moreover, the large tumor presented significant, life-altering consequences if simply removed through surgery.  An aggressive treatment program of chemotherapy and radiation, both to shrink the tumor and to address any other malignancies in the body, would be critical for Jason’s quality of life. Following consultations with some of the most highly respected sarcoma doctors and centers in the nation, Jason and Stephanie have identified the Houston, Texas-based cancer hospital MD Anderson as their preferred hospital for treatment. MD Anderson features a prominent and comprehensive sarcoma treatment center with experienced specialists and, most significantly, a proven track record of success in treating sarcoma.Next Steps: A Major MoveThe road ahead will be difficult. The current plan is for Jason to receive approximately six intense rounds of chemotherapy over the course of four months, followed by five weeks of radiation treatment. Approximately one month after the conclusion of radiation, the doctors expect to attempt to remove the tumor (which we earnestly pray will be much smaller by that time!).The treatments (chemotherapy and radiation) will be lengthy, intense, and challenging. In addition, significant financial, emotional, and spiritual costs loom on the horizon. At this time, the Le Shanas plan to temporarily relocate their entire family to Houston while Jason receives chemotherapy and radiation (i.e., about 5-6 months), leaving a significant emotional and spiritual support system behind in Southern California. Although some extended family members live in the Houston area, the financial costs associated with pursuing this treatment are daunting.We need YOU to continue to support Jason, Stephanie, Elijah, Micah, and baby Jude through prayer and giving financially as you are able!  Thank you!This GoFundMe account has been created to ask for your support in as few as one, and as many as three ways:1. Pray: This battle is spiritual as much as it is physical. We invite you to commit to praying for the Le Shana family in this season. Specific request for the boys are for their overall adjustment to the move and for good school options for Elijah (Kindergarten) and Micah (Pre-K). Jason and Stephanie request prayer for peace and trust in God in this season of the unknown, for strength physically, emotionally, and spiritually during Jason’s treatments, and that Jason will be HEALED!2. Give: Jason’s cancer diagnosis has led to significant, unplanned expenses. Money donated to them through this site will help to offset these costs, including but not limited to the following: increased health insurance premiums, medical costs (specialist appointments, scans/tests, prescriptions, chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, etc), housing costs in Houston, travel to and from treatment (both car and airfare), and to supplement lower than usual income.3. Share with your networks: We won’t be able to reach these goals without the help of a large village. Please consider sharing this with your friends and family, either via social networks, email, or word of mouth.Note from the campaign organizer: Angela Rickey is the cousin of Jason Le Shana. She has partnered with Alison Westerlind (also cousin of Jason Le Shana) as the campaign team from Arizona representing all Family Members supporting The Le Shanas. Due to the overwhelming response to this site, a withdrawl plan has been established for Jason Le Shana as the beneficiary of all donations.

He has a tumour on his brain stem. Anything helps! A donation, telling your friends and family, sharing on social media, and of course your prayers.I will tell u more info below My older brother Brett, my mother Carmen, and my Stepdad Vingo are asking for your help!   Sheklun is a great brother with an amazing heart. He is loving and caring. He always makes sure you are good before he is! He has such a kind soul and is very down to earth. He is always looking out for his family and friends. Always asks me to take pictures and capture the good times! He deserves a better life!  On Jan 2, Sheklun passed out at home and was rushed via ambulance to the Stollery Children’s Hospital. We thought nothing of it and just thought he passed out from choking on a smoothie he was drinking. It turns out he passed out from a hypoxic event (shortage of oxygen). During our visit to the ER on January 2nd our world was turned upside down. We found out he had a tumour on his brain stem. Near the end of October 2018 Sheklun’s symptoms began; he had minor balance issues and slurred speech. We thought nothing of it. Surgery was planned for January 9th to allow him to be stabilized. We were fortunate enough to have the best neurosurgeon in Canada, Dr. V. Mehta. Also fortunate for his team and neurosurgery nurse practitioner Wendy.   On January 9th the exophytic (outside) part of the tumour was removed. However his brain stem is still infilterated with the tumour. The tumour is glioblastoma grade IV, aka GBM. The location of the tumour and the type of the tumour with the mutations is very very rare. The tumour was affecting his auto drive to breathe. Due to the removal of the exophytic part of the tumour, the pressure on his brain went down. His breathing and voice improved.   On January 11 Sheklun was extubated and it was successful. Sheklun began walking again on January 13 around the hospital and even to the healing garden. He did these walks from the 13th-18th. Things were looking really good! Then on January 19th we noticed he had a weaker voice and couldn’t stand. On January 23 things got really scary as his Co2 levels greatly elevated. He was placed on a ventilator. January 24th his Co2 levels elevated even more. On January 25th Sheklun was intubated and radiation treatments began in hopes to slow down the growth of the tumour. We are 3 radiation treatments down and things are looking good.  We are buying Sheklun more time so he can leave Canada and get the treatments he needs to defeat this rare tumour!Anything helps right now! Please share, donate and of course pray for Sheklun! If if you would like to make it easier to share, please check out my post, stories and tweet regarding Sheklun on Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat.

As a young and healthy man at the age of 37, this came as quite a shock to everyone. He is a son to Janis and Gary, brother to Jennifer and Jonathan, husband to Stella, a father to his son Dylan, and a relative and friend to countless others. His daughter is due to be born in December. Brian recently started a new job in the Bay Area, and the medical insurance for him between his jobs puts him in a precarious position. As such, the insurance and medical bills are expected to be very expensive as he begins treatment.We are setting this GoFundMe page up to help with the costs of his treatment. The road ahead is scary, but we all remain hopeful that Brian will succeed in beating this awful disease. Any donation amount is appreciated and tax deductible, and we highly encourage everyone to please share this page with your friends and family. Brian is committed to his family, community, and country. He proudly served in the United States Marine Corps for 5 years. He went on to earn a Master of Arts in Nonproliferation and Terrorism Studies from the Middlebury Institute for International Studies at Monterey. Your donation will go a long way to help ensure Brian lives a long life where he can continue to contribute his love to his family. We thank you so much for your support in this difficult time.A message from Stella, Brian's wife:Brian is a loving husband and father that always puts his family first. No matter how long his work day he makes quality time for me and our baby everyday. Brian is a big animal lover especially to our dogs, one who has passed and one who is still with us and does her happy dance every time he comes home. This diagnosis came as a shock to everyone as he is one of the healthiest people we know. He eats healthy and exercises and encourages the same for his loved ones. As a busy mom it was very hard for me to eat healthy at times as I would just grab what was fast and easy and not always healthy. He would take the time everyday to cook for me and make sure I’m eating healthy. He would always come home from a long day at work and cook, clean, and take care of our baby to help me get a break. On weekends he did yard work among other things that needed to be done. He always had so much energy and drive and it is very difficult for me to see him so weak. He has some very bad symptoms from the cancer which has affected his stomach and liver. His energy levels are so low. It is very hard on him as well, feeling that he can’t do all the things he use to. We have just moved back to the Bay Area which has been a difficult transition and we are grateful for the help we received during this difficult time. We are excited for our daughter to arrive who is due in December. We are looking forward to starting his chemo and recovery. We are very grateful for your help and donation during this difficult time.

The road ahead requires much more extensive medical care with numerous doctors and continuous monitoring.  We all know someone who has been affected by this horrendous disease and how it takes an emotional toll on the patient. We all hope and pray for her full recovery. Michele’s friends and family can provide emotional support and get her to doctor appointments, but we desperately need financial help.  Michele needs all her energy focused on healing rather than worrying.  Being that she lives alone and is the sole income provider, the mounting medical bills and basic living expenses are overwhelming in the face of everything else.  Helping Michele now is a minor way in which we all can assist in alleviating the burden that this devastating medical diagnosis bears on her shoulders.

It was 10:30pm and I received a call from my daughter, Cynthia’s boyfriend that she was having trouble speaking coherently and was disoriented. He told me he wanted to take her to the emergency room in Fayetteville, AR, where she attends college. I agreed and told him I would meet him at the hospital but we live in Tulsa, OK which is two hours away. On the drive to Fayetteville, we received another phone call telling us that the CT scan showed a mass on Cynthia’s brain. By the time we reached the hospital our worst fears were confirmed. Cynthia had a tumor in her brain the size of the surgeon’s fist and would require surgery. On January 25, Cynthia underwent a craniotomy to remove the tumor. The pathology report confirmed our next greatest fear. The tumor was a grade 4 glioblastoma, the most aggressive cancer that begins in the brain. Cynthia’s surgery went very well and the surgeon was confident he removed most all of the tumor that he could safely remove. The speed of Cynthia’s recovery from surgery amazed everyone who worked with her, from the nurses and doctors at the hospital and then at the rehabilitation hospital. Cynthia still has a long way to go. She will begin a regiment of radiation and chemotherapy at the same time followed by more chemotherapy after a resting period and possibly other procedures after that. Many people who have been praying for my daughter don’t even really know her and don’t even realize that while yes, it was a significant event because she was a loved daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece, cousin, roommate, friend, etc... there was much more to her story. I wanted to take an opportunity to tell you about her and tell you why what she is going through is so significant and at the same time amazing. Cynthia is 20 years old and a Junior at the University of Arkansas. My daughter is smart. I mean SCARY smart. In Kindergarten her teacher held a competition to see which student could read the most books by the end of the school year. To add to her motivation, I told her that I would pay her $1 for every book she read. She won the competition and it cost me over $50. I have often said that $50 was the best investment I have EVER made. Her love for reading continued to bloom and her thirst for knowledge grew along with it. She was pretty much a straight A student. Her teachers will tell you she was the kind of student that would be upset with herself if an assignment received lower than an A. In 7th grade, her state testing scores qualified her to be invited to participate in the Duke TIP program that allowed her to take the ACT college readiness exam. Her score was high enough that the test indicated she was ready for college as a 7th grader!! When it came time to take the test in high school, she scored a 31 which is outstanding but she wasn’t satisfied with that and took the test again. This time she made a 34!!! That score along with an outstanding interview lead her to not only be offered a scholarship to the University of Arkansas, but one step higher. She would become a fellow, earning a Fellowship to attend the U of A in their Honors College. She entered college already having 29 college credits because of AP high school courses and concurrent college classes while still in high school. While growing up she had one career goal that never wavered since the 3rd grade. She wanted to be a pediatrician. She is a DOUBLE major of Pre-med Biology AND Psychology, but she wasn’t satisfied with just those two hard majors, she also is obtaining a minor in French! This is all incredible when you recognize this all had been accomplished while unknown to any of us there was this growing tumor in her brain. Only FIVE days earlier before she entered the hospital, this incredible young woman completed the MCAT (medical school entrance exam)!And then..... 5 days later that incredible future seemed to now be in question. I don’t know what exactly will happen. I know one thing and it is the most important thing..... my daughter is alive!! She has survived a 4 hour long surgery to remove the huge tumor and is getting stronger and better everyday since that surgery. College for now is on hold. We contacted the university and found out the procedure for withdrawing for this semester. We hope that she will only be out one semester and then be right back on track to return to college this coming fall. I know my daughter, she is stubborn and strong. If anyone can do this it is her! So, this is for who you are praying. Praying that not only does God heal her body but that He also keeps the world from being robbed of an incredible doctor that one day will have an impact on hundreds and thousands of lives. As always, my family cherishes your prayers and support and we love each and every one of you!",2ffae84e34303ddb0256bd2c7f80a087,49,0.1402,17.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

FROM THE BEGINNINGWhen you are a young adult attending college, working full time, and chasing your rambunctious but highly intelligent son through a bedtime routine, the last thing you expect is to end up in the ER in terrible pain. You especially do not expect to hear that the pain isn’t something simple to remedy, but in fact, is a softball sized tumor growing on your ribs. That’s exactly the challenge life served Bonnie.So, the mass was removed in one of the most painful surgeries a person can undergo. The Dr. sat across from Bonnie’s mother and partner with news to deliver that makes time stand still and your breath stop. “It’s definitely CANCER.”  Soon thereafter Bonnie began a rigorous regimen of inpatient chemotherapy which included a 5 day hospital stay (due to the intensity of the chemo) every 4th week. Between her inpatient chemotherapy visits, she was also receiving outpatient infusions every other week. Throw in another rib resection surgery mid-year and several hospital admissions for neutropenic shock, and Bonnie spent more of 2017 in the hospital than she spent time at home with her family.Happy news came early 2018. She had finally completed her year of chemo treatments and was given the ""all clear"" when her scans came back free of any indication of cancer. Bonnie could finally move forward with plans they had to relocate to Oregon, continue school and work, meet new people and enjoy time with family. DISCOURAGING NEWSWhen Bonnie went to the oncologist this September for her first routine 6 month follow up, the CT scans showed spots on lungs that were not there in February. After a biopsy a week later, it was confirmed that her cancer has returned. The new prognosis was originally presented as a pretty bleak scenario. Bonnie was offered limited treatment options that typically only show benefit in 30%- 50% of patients treated. Bonnie's oncologist was optimistic that if they could find the right treatment it could possibly stop the cell regeneration and maybe even send the cancer into remission. This suggestion offered her hope, until it was coupled with the phrases ”to hope for 10 years would be optimistic"" and that anything currently available would still result in ""just biding time"". We felt defeated, but did not give up. A SECOND OPINIONThis is where we would appreciate your help!We reached out to Cancer Treatment Center of America for a second opinion and their attitude from the very beginning was one of optimism. They assessed the situation and believe that all treatment should be designed to cure and not just bide time. They are ready to review her individual diagnosis and create a treatment plan tailored to her specific cancer. Although Bonnie's insurance does cover some of the costs of treatment, she is seeking funding  to compensate for loss of income she will suffer while unable to work, loss of income her loved ones and support team may experience when helping her to treatments, reoccurring insurance premiums to maintain her health care coverage, insurance co-pays, deductibles, travel expenses to the out-of-state treatment facilities, additional childcare costs for her 7 year old son so he can attend daycare while she receives treatments, and any of the many other unforeseeable costs associated with such a diagnosis.As with any cancer diagnosis, time is of the essence. Initial funding will be put to use as early as this week when Bonnie heads to her first consultation with Cancer Treatment Center of America. The need for funding will be a continuous one as we learned in 2017, and every cent or every ""share"" of this GoFundMe link,  and Bonnie's story, is appreciated more than you can imagine.We understand not everyone will be able to donate, and that is okay! If you are unable to donate, but would still like to help, here's some suggestions:- Spread the word!

In 2010, I was given a specific amount of time to live (less than a year), due to being diagnosed with various disorders; one being Congested Heart Failure with an ejection fraction of 5%. Based on the diagnosis of one of my ailments, my heart at the time was not able to continue pumping the blood around my body. This caused kidney failure, edema, and my organs were starting to shut down. My body started to retain fluid and swell, which caused a huge amount to remain in my lungs. It was so bad at the time, my doctors wanted to amputate one of my legs due to a hole that was created from the lack of proper blood flow down to my bone. I went through additional testing because my doctors believed that I had Lupus; which is rare in men. I found out in December 2013 that I don't have Lupus and my heart is better; however, I am not completely healed yet.  I am still having various issues with my heart and my Doctors want to perform other invasive surgeries on me.  After more testing, I have been diagnosed with a Rare Blood Cancer Called MGUS/Multiple Myeloma.  I am doing all that I can to learn about this disease that I am facing.  In addition, I am maintaining my doctor visits to a Bone Marrow clinic for my diagnosis. It has been a journey, and the healing process isn't over yet, but through faith, I am Claiming it in the name of Jesus. I can remember not being about to even walk 1/4 of a mile to take my dog out of my home. With the help of my amazing Team At Duke HealthCare (My PCP, Nutritionist, Cardiologist, and the Holy Spirit for guiding these wonderful people along with a few others that helped) I am able to get around a little better. I share this message to encouage someone not to give up. God isn't done writing your story. As long as I am alive, on this side of the world, I will share with as many as I can what HE HAS DONE FOR ME!! I am 170 pounds down and well on my way to recovery!! I still have more surgeries and continued treatment to undergo. I am reaching out asking many of you to sow a seed to help with my treatments, medicines/prescriptions, expensive medical copays, travel expenses to and from doctor visits that are sometimes out of state; and various other expenses that have been generated. I wanted to reach out to a few of my friends to see if you could donate. I am trying to raise as much money that I can before my next couple of surgeries.  If you desire to give, feel free to donate here on GofundMe.

However, that isn’t the case anymore and that is why we are asking for anyone to help. Evan will continue to stay at the Edmonton hospital for a month but will need to stay in Edmonton for a YEAR!

Also, at that point he doesn’t have to have radiation. Only the chemo. Since he will be very susceptible to getting sick, they need him to stay close by. He has also been told he won’t be working for the next two years. Now, as you can imagine this situation would be very hard for anyone. His girlfriend, Cori, is put in a rather awful position as well because they have now been torn apart, she lives in GP where she has her job and her loved one will be 5 hours away in Edmonton.  This is going to cause a lot of financial stress, which is why we are hoping to raise something to help them out for the next year or two. Here is a ink to what he has been diagnosed with:     http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-type/non-hodgkin-lymphoma/non-hodgkin-lymphoma/more-types-of-nhl/lymphoblastic-lymphoma/?region=onI thank you in advance for any donations as well as simply sharing this page with everyone you know.  This is an extremely hard time for our family.",949d0fcaae3646af888ffb935691b244,17,100.5,12.0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Ashley is a 26-year-old single mother of a beautiful one-year-old girl, Natalie Ann. Shortly after Natalie's first birthday, Ashley suffered a seizure which led to the discovery of a tumor in the frontal lobe of her brain. Within a few days, Ashley underwent surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. Due to the location of the tumor, only about 70% was successfully able to be removed. Shortly thereafter, a biopsy revealed a devastating diagnosis. The tumor was determined to be a Stage IV Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive type of cancer that can begin within the brain. There is no cure for GBM. In order to slow the growth of the tumor and maximize Ashley's time with her daughter, she is set to begin chemo and radiation this week.Ashley has always given of herself, family being her number one priority since childhood. Recently, she set aside her career to help care for her mother who suffers from a form of muscular dystrophy.  Having Natalie has brought a light to their lives that had been missing for so long. Everyone who knows Ashley knew that she would be a great mother, but since the day Natalie Ann was born, there has been a light in Ashley's eyes that I've never seen before.  She was  meant to be this little girls mommy and all Ashley wants to do right now is spend as much time as possible with her baby girl.I'm asking anyone and everyone to please consider donating whatever you can to help this family focus on what's most important, not wondering how they're going to afford the next medical bill that comes their way.

I want to share a story with you about how our world has been turned upside down. In late June of 2018, while running on the treadmill, my dad noticed an uncoordinated feeling on his left side, particularly his arm and leg, of which he described as a flopping sensation. Later that day while loading his pickup truck, he stepped off a platform and fell between the bushes in the yard. A quick call to his dad (a former Vietnam corpsman) resulted in an urgent plea to go directly to the emergency room to check for signs of a stroke. After an initial exam and 15 minutes in an MRI tube, the emergency room doctor delivered the alarming news. He explained that sitting directly over the control center of his left arm and leg was a 2-centimeter tumor. The next few days were full of distraction and uncertainty. From running his business to preparing the lakehouse for his niece’s wedding reception, my dad exuded immense positivity and determination. Then on July 6th just one day after his 1 year wedding anniversary to his best friend, and, self-described angel Karen, my dad began phase two which included the 5-hour brain surgery to biopsy the tumor. The surgeons removed as much of the tumor as possible--any more would have left him with a significant loss of function. And, before I knew it he called me shortly after the procedure to reassure me that he was okay and to sprinkle some of his optimism on my worried heart. Two days later he was released home for rest and rehab. Several weeks past before doctors discovered precisely what he was up against. The results were what we feared the most. The big C word. Cancer. Stage 4 (inoperable) Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). It is terminal with a prognosis of 14-16 months with treatment. This 57-year-old father, newlywed, son, brother, friend, business owner, 3-mile runner, boat driver, motorcycle rider, guitar player and the king of positivity and happiness has been humbled beyond comprehension. The months following the prognosis have included chemotherapy, radiation, occupational and physical therapy 4x/week, nurses visits, as well as wearing his Optune (a device creating wavelike electric fields to slow or stop GBM cells from dividing) for 18-24 hours a day. Despite the fact that these treatments have taken a toll on his mobility they are providing my dad with a priceless treasure and that is time. Spending time with family, friends, and his fur babies watching movies, laughing, convalescing by the lake, and reminiscing is immensely important at this stage. I have created this GoFundMe page with the intention of easing their financial challenges but most of all to provide my dad with the important medical devices he needs such as a wheelchair ramp and 24-hour in-home care to ensure that he is safe and comfortable. Please reach out to him via Facebook or DM me for his direct contact information. He would love calls, messages, letters, and visitors. The more the merrier!

It affected my breathing my oxygen level and had me in bed for around 6 weeks. I developed pneumonia from it and saw a noticeable marked difference before and after the flu with my breathing. With no Health Insurance I did what many Moms do…put ourselves on the least priority list. I honestly thought I would just get better. My Dr. thought I had some damage to my lungs due to the pneumonia but it was manageable. I had a chronic cough but it really did not impact nor affect my daily life. I was told I had mild asthma and allergies which made sense. I used an inhaler when I had flare ups and everyone around me became numb to my cough. I am not a smoker nor ever have been. people who are smokers smoke outside when I am near by and my home is 100% smoke free. I cared for animals, lifted heavy bags of feed, exercised and despite coughing spells and frequent bronchitis I was impacted very minimally. It became my normal. In July during one of my coughing spells I started coughing up blood. Even us tried and true Martyr Moms know this is the time to get to a Dr. We recently acquired a high deductible Health Insurance policy so decided to use it. My Dr thought I had a sinus infection she decided to do a sinus ct scan and add on a chest ct in case. At the hospital the techs broke character and shockingly asked me if I worked at an asbestos factory. I knew the scan was abnormal but was not ready to hear that I had Chronic Interstitial Lung Disease with Pulmonary Fibrosis. My Pulmonary Dr. assured me while it is labeled as incurable many treatments including lung transplant can greatly increase quality of life and life span. We were devastated to hear this. 5 years? How is this possible for a nonsmoking very active female? This is something 90-year-old men get after heavy smoking for years, right? Upon further scans Dr's became concerned with a dark mass on my lower left lung. Upon several attempts at biopsy and a very painful open lung biopsy, I was told that the tumor is Non-small cell adenocarcinoma lung cancer.  A further Pet Scan found another active spot on my upper right lobe that is the same cancer type. Apparently, the bad condition of my lungs makes my cells reproduce as cancer cells instead of healthy cells. At my most recent visit Hopkins Dr's told me that due to my Lung Disease they cannot aggressively treat the cancer and due to the cancer, they cannot properly treat my Lung disease. They labeled me as incurable and said on average people in my situation live about 1 year. They are offering Chemotherapy to see if they can slow the progression of cancer growth and prolong my life. My first treatment was on November 28th. Thus far my body is handling the chemo well. I have faith and hope. I am also trying Chinese medicine and some alternative therapies. Now adding insult to injury when people like myself hear devastating news like this, many things happen. You see the sadness and horror in your friends and family’s eyes. You realize that all your plans for Grandkids, growing old with your kids and spouse and friends are all in jeopardy. You watch as income dwindles and expenses rise and see the immense impact your illness has on those you love. Agencies that are supposed to be your safety net treat you like you are trying to pull one over on them. So instead of enjoying every minute with your family you are visiting lawyers, getting loans on your house and signing papers to try to extend your life. It is devastating. My goal in life is and has always been to help others. My prayer is that if even 1 person goes to see their Dr for an annoying cough and gets early treatment and saves them and their families from going through what we are then it will be worth being open about our current struggles.",fb8a0b46e2daa570f25bb3a69871ce26,54,0.3,24.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

We were seeing her with a fever, she was very lethargic to the point where she was peeing the bed 3-4 times a night opposed to her usual, once maybe twice a week. We ended up  keeping her from school Tuesday and Wednesday Franka received a phone call from Isabella’s school because she hadn’t stopped crying. So when Franka picked her up from school, Isabella’s grand mother, Jen had pointed out that Isabella’s skin was extremely yellow and that we should bring her to her pediatrician.Franka brought her to her pediatrician and got blood work done. Not even 10 minutes after they left, Franka received a phone call from the office and we were told that we had to bring her to Tufts floating hospital in Boston, but we decided to go to Children’s hospital instead. When we got to the ER, they immediately got us into a private room, took her blood, and had some pretty accurate answers within hours. They prepared us for what had looked like leukemia. In which after more blood work, they confirmed that Isabella had been diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. (A.L.L.). This news has been hands down the worst news we’ve  ever received. But the children’s hospital staff has not only been extremely informative, but amazing with how they treat our daughter. They let us know that even though some children do pass away from her version of leukemia ( A.L.L.; higher risk due to a genetic mutation) the majority of children can be cured.  Being affiliated with Dana Farber, having our family and friends as our support system, and by faith in God,  she is in the best hands in the country to treat this. Which has made us very confident in the fact that our daughter WILL beat this and will kick cancers butt.The unfortunate side to this, is that she still has to undergo 25 months of chemotherapy. This has been taking a huge toll on us already. We are currently living in children’s hospital. We please ask that you keep us in your thoughts and prayers and we will keep you posted on her updates. With Franka and I being out of work now, we are asking that you could please help us out by donating in order to reach our financial goal, so that we can accomplish our main goal, and that’s to be there for our daughter at every moment for the next 25 months without having to worry about any finances.

The contributions you give will help pay the medical expenses while in the hospital. Witnessing her journey throughout these years has been nothing but miraculous. She had defeated cancer once before and was on her way to significant life changing accomplishments. Since battling this horrific and challenging disease, she has had to step back and humble herself by asking for any help. She is getting physically weaker and currently undergoes blood and platelet transfusions weekly. Susan’s driving force through this ordeal is her 3 children, husband, and sisters and are the backbone of organizing all the efforts towards her recovery. Her family will need OUR support through this time while continuing to taking care of normal life’s expenses.

His parents, Carlos and Ruby Muñoz, are hardworking and responsible people who have always provided for their family. It’s hard for them to admit they need this kind of help, but they need our help as they tenaciously fight for Ramses’s life. Please read on to learn about his fight and about how you can help out.￼￼Ramses (far right) with his family last year￼￼Last year in a congregation clean-upRamses’s SituationOn December 20, 2018, he was diagnosed with a deadly and rare blood cancer- Early T-Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ETP ALL).  For a month after diagnosis, Ramses stayed in the hospital to receive chemo treatments followed by a second bone marrow biopsy. Unfortunately, the results of the biopsy revealed that the treatments had not reduced the Leukemia cells as expected. This means a new course of treatment – a more aggressive form of chemo and a transplant.  The rare nature of his Leukemia makes treatment difficult. In addition, the treatment and the disease itself bring on complications like low hemoglobin, which only makes the situation more dire.Pretty much every day since his diagnosis, Ramses has been hospitalized.  While Carlos continues to work, Ruby stays with Ramses 24/7 at the hospital.  This means she hasn’t been able to report to work this entire time. Carlos and their other two sons make the 40-mile, one-way drive to the hospital to provide support.  This is all very demanding on the whole family physically, mentally and financially.How You Can HelpFinancially- All of the funds raised will go towards medical bills, uncovered medical expenses- (such as supplements helping Ramses during chemo), family bills, and costs related to their needs while staying at the hospital. Ruby and Carlos will be the only ones authorized to withdraw any funds. ANY amount will help!   Recommendations- If you know anyone who has fought this disease or know any information about doctors who treat it, please email us that information.  Ruby and Carlos continue to search for the best treatment options possible. Getting the word out- Please share this link and Ramses’s story with others (ex. social media, email, fliers, word-of-mouth). This will allow others the opportunity to help out as well and will make this campaign more successful! Last, but most importantly, we ask that you, please, keep Ramses and his family in your prayers.  Psalms 46:1 says, “God is our refuge and strength, a help that is readily found in times of distress”.  We’re confident He will be refuge and strength to them throughout this fight!   Thank you in advance for your loving support!  -Natalie Crumpler (family friend)¡AYUDEMOS A RAMSÉS Y A SU FAMILIA A COMBATIR SU LEUCEMIA!Ramsés es un joven de 13 años con hermosas cualidades- amoroso y bien espiritual.  Sus padres, Carlos y Ruby Muñoz, son personas responsables que siempre han cuidado y provisto para su familia. Es difícil para ellos admitir/aceptar este tipo de ayuda, pero definitivamente necesitan nuestra ayuda mientras batallan tenazmente por la vida de Ramsés.  Por favor lea a continuación para aprender sobre su situación y como podemos ayudar.LA SITUACION DE RAMSÉSEl 20 de diciembre del 2018 a Ramsés se le diagnosticó un tipo de leucemia que es raro y bien difícil de tratar- en inglés esta se llama Early T-Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ETP ALL).  Durante un mes después de su diagnostico, Ramsés estuvo hospitalizado recibiendo tratamientos de quimioterapia seguidos por una segunda biopsia de medula.  Lamentablemente, los resultados de la biopsia revelaron que el tratamiento no había reducido las células de leucemia suficientemente. Esto significa que un nuevo tratamiento es necesario.  Este consiste en una quimioterapia mas agresiva seguido por un trasplante.  Adicionalmente, tanto la leucemia en sí, como el tratamiento tienen efectos secundarios peligrosos como baja hemoglobina. Esto pone a Ramsés en mas peligro.   Prácticamente casi todos los días desde su diagnostico, Ramsés ha estado hospitalizado.  Mientras Carlos continua su trabajo seglar, Ruby se queda en el hospital con Ramsés día y noche.  Esto significa que ella no ha podido reportarse a su trabajo todo este tiempo.  Carlos y sus dos hijos viajan seguido unas 40 millas hasta el hospital para ayudar.  Todo esto exige mucho de la familia entera en sentido físico, emocional y financiero.COMO PODEMOS AYUDAREconómicamente- Todo fondo recibido será destinado a pagar cuentas medicas, gastos médicos no cubiertos por seguro medico (ej. suplementos que le ayudan a Ramsés a tolerar el quimio), cuentas del hogar, y gastos relacionados con su estadía en el hospital (gas, alimentos, etc). Ruby y Carlos son los únicos autorizados para sacar fondos de esta cuenta. ¡CUALQUIER cantidad puede ayudar y es apreciada!Recomendaciones- Si usted conoce a alguien que tiene experiencia con esta enfermedad o conoce de algún medico que atienda pacientes con la misma, por favor envíenos un mensaje.  Ruby y Carlos continúan buscando el mejor tratamiento para Ramsés. Anunciando esta campaña- Por favor comparta la historia de Ramsés con otros (ej. Anuncios impresos, correo electrónico, cuentas sociales como Facebook y WhatsApp, etc).  ¡Esto contribuirá al éxito de la campaña!Finalmente- pero lo mas importante- suplicamos que mantengan a Ramsés y su familia en sus oraciones.  Salmos 46:1 dice, “Dios es para nosotros un refugio y fuerza, una ayuda que puede hallarse prontamente durante angustias.” ¡Estamos seguros de que El será tal refugio y fuerza para ellos mientras luchan!¡Gracias por su atención y amorosa ayuda!",ce0051643dec85bf92c5e13088aa42b1,47,0.756,12.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Sean is one of the most vivacious, hilarious, strong, resilient, FUN, and full of life people that you will ever meet. He is one of those people that you want to be best friends with – or at least be close to as soon as you meet him.  Always there to pick you up when you are down, always the first to be on your side and make you feel special… this is why he is so loved by many.He was just starting a new chapter in his life when he received this diagnosis. He was only in his second week of classes in the Arboriculture program at Humber College when he started feeling excruciating pain in his body.  On the advice of his parents he went to Michael Garron Hospital.

We have been very private about his cancer as a whole.  Trying to deal with his treatments, and the business by ourselves while battling this debilitating disease.  If there is anything that I am learning from this is that you can not do it all by yourself. Its not physically or mentally possible.  

Our friends suggested we start a gofundme page to help with our accumulating financial responsibilties during this difficult time.   This past spring my husband Aaron and I had decided to take our business to the next level by Aaron quitting his full time job to persue our dream of building Tiny Homes for others.  Our business was taking off and we were so excited to see it our efforts coming to life. 

Then on May 3, 2018 we went to the hospital for what we thought to be a stroke or other health issue due to Aaron not feeling well.  After a CT Scan we were told that he had a very large mass in his chest.   This mass was biopsied and on May 7, 2018, we were then admitted to U of M Hospital and Aaron was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive leukemia called Acute T-cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia.  

Aaron is fighting hard to beat this cancer but as of late all the chemotherapy and prescription are getting the best of him. He was just readmitted for a short time at U of M for a blood clot in his lung. He is suffering daily from nausea and dizzy spells.  It's hard to see your loved one who was once so strong be debilitated by this decease.  He is currently in round two of his treatment and we are starting the process of preparing for a bone marrow transplant.

The expenses are getting beyond our means and are asking for help to cover our transportation, living expenses, and general needs during this time.

And imagine you have a gorgeous and happy 9 year old daughter. One day she gets sick, doctors inform you that your little girl is seriously sick and that she has - Acute Myeloid Leukemia. How would you feel, what would you do... And that is exactly what happened to our little Teodora. By the April 2016, Teodora was a healthy child, who spent time playing with her school friends and her little brother Djordje. But slowly she start becoming too tired and the pain in her legs were enabling her to play or attend school. She began to fade, the disease was taking over…And then the first analysis were completed, it was Acute Myeloid Leukemia. AML is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that build up in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. Since May 2016, Teodora`s parents and doctors at the Institute ""Dr Vukan Cupic"" in Belgrade began the relentless battle for Teodora`s life. She is just a little girl with the severe disease that has undergone exhausting aggressive therapy - five cycles of chemotherapy, where many complications prevented the desired results.This type of cancer is difficult to cure and the only way Teodora could be saved is a Bone Marrow Transplantation. The only hospital that can complete this procedure, to replace damaged or destroyed bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells is the Children’s Hospital in Frankfurt, Germany. The cost for this procedure is 350,000 euros.Teodora`s dad, Bogdan, says: ""My wife and I work in the media and we wouldn`t be able to earn this amount of money if we were to live our three lives! That much money, we simply don`t have, not even close to that. But we have no rights to give up the fight for the life of our Teodora, as she struggles to win this battle like the greatest warrior. The boundless love for our child we have, as any other parent in this world, gives us the strength to push, hope and believe that with the help of good people, institutions, agencies, companies - we will be able to collect the necessary 350,000 euros” Teodora`s situation is getting worse every day.

In just a matter of weeks our sweet, energetic, smiley young baby boy could barely walk or sit up for very long and had begun to look very sick and very sad. Our daughter Zoe, age 3, didn’t understand why her brother wouldn’t play anymore.We were immediately being sent to the local ER for testing. They said something was very wrong with his blood, his hemoglobin was 2.5, the doctor said he had never seen any person that low, he was barely alive. He began transfusions immediately while waiting for transport to the nearest children’s hospital and a hematologist/oncologist who would meet us in the Pediatric ICU where Dakota would have to remain until stable.We were transferred to the PICU at Palm Beach Children’s Hospital where we remained for 4 days. By the end of our stay in PICU, he had received 6 blood transfusions, 2 platelet transfusions, had a bone marrow biopsy, 2 lumbar punctures and a port had to be surgically implanted in chest wall. Dakota was diagnosed that Thursday with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).  They said his bone marrow was 75% leukemia cells and that the pressure they cause on his bones from the inside out meant our little boy had been in unbearable pain.  He began receiving chemo and we remained in the hospital for the next two weeks.Our Doctors have told us that his treatment will be at least a three year full time treatment plan that will include chemotherapy at home and in clinic, inpatient hospital stays and a lot of changes to our home and to Dakota and our family’s every day lives.  While we are hoping that our  insurance will cover a good portion of Dakota’s medical expenses, the reality is we aren't sure how much will be covered and the bills are already starting to pile up less than a month into his treatment.  There are other uncovered costs like his daily medications, special dietary changes, and changes we have to make in our home during his three year long treatment.  As his main care provider I will also not be able to return to work. We love our son very much and just want him to get better and will do whatever it takes to make that happen.

Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow that causes the bone marrow to create too many immature lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell.  In a healthy child, the bone marrow creates immature cells (blood stem cells) that mature over time and can become one of two types of mature cell.  The first is a myeloid cell: red blood cells, platelets, or white blood cells, or the second is a lymphoid stem cell: natural killer cells, or lymphocytes that help fight infection.  As a child with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Jared’s body is producing too many stem cells that become lymphoblasts and lymphocytes but they do not work like normal cells as they struggle to fight infection.  These cells are called leukemia cells.  As the leukemia cells increase in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room available for healthy white blood cells, platelets and red blood cells resulting in increases chance of infection (National Cancer Institute, 2017). Jared will be enduring a three year long treatment at the University of Kentucky Medical Center, with the most intense treatment occurring during the first 6 months. The chemotherapy and other medications he will endure are going to make him an extremely sick kid. But in the long run will help his body fight this cancer and get back to living his normal life that every child deserves! We will be standing behind Jared and our family throughout this entire process, as we are sure so many of you will be too. We hope that you will consider donating to help an amazing boy and an even more amazing family during this challenging time.  No donation is too small and we are extremely grateful for your support during this time.

The doctors came back with test result showing she had Leukemia. April has been through chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant spending months in the hospital. Unfortunately her health had a major setback the past few months. Her parents have done as much as transferring her from Oklahoma to Tennessee, and contacting St. Jude Hospital in Texas for a second opinion.

Raquel, her mom has stayed strong at their side while taking care of Jeremy, Jonny and Audrey. This family is in dire need of help.

On Monday, October 29th, Madi’s 5th birthday, Ashley received the call from the doctors confirming what she feared most.  Madison’s second bone marrow biopsy was positive for Leukemia.The type of cancer Madi has is called Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).  It's an aggressive blood cancer. It is fast spreading and represents about twenty percent of all childhood forms of leukemia.  Madi's doctors have told Ashley and Chris that the five year prognosis is 50/50. A few children do not survive the treatment because of how stressful it is on their cardiovascular system and immune system.   They are asking for your thoughts and your prayers. Please do not feel sorry for them. Feel positive and optimistic that Madi makes it through this with as little difficulty as possible. Hug your kids, go donate blood, be kind to strangers in Madi’s honor.  Live your life fully and know in your hearts that Madi will be a part of our lives for a long time to come! Family and Friends, It is time to rally for Madi and Ashley!Ashley will be unable to work full time in her profession as a realtor because Madi's treatment requires that she be hospitalized for the better part of six to nine months.  Ashley will be in the hospital right beside her. Madi's doctors have said she can expect a short break away from the hospital every couple months but during these breaks, she will need to limit her exposure to other people including family members.  Madison will be severely neutropenic as a result of her extremely compromised immune system.   As Ashely and her  family live approximately 35 miles away from the hospital, Ashley will rent an apartment next to the hospital.   This will serve as a safe home space for Madi during her short breaks from treatment as well as respite for Ashley when she gets a break from fighting alongside Madi.  While we hope that most of the medical expenses will be covered by insurance, any procedures that are not covered will translate into greater financial burden since Ashely will be unable to work during Madi's treatment.   Our wish is to ease that hardship with any donations that we receive so that Ashley  may focus all of her energy and spirit towards Madi's healing.  We are dedicating this page to fund ongoing medical costs and everyday expenses for Madi’s treatment.  We are grateful for each contribution, as this page is not solely intended for financial reasons, but also to serve as support for Ashley and Chris while they navigate this difficult life challenge.  Share your stories of hope and words of encouragement as often as you feel moved to do so! Please continue to keep Madi and family in your prayers.

She was recently diagnosed with Acute Leukemia.  She has been receiving treatment at Northside Hospital in Atlanta since February 6th but recently found out her insurance isn't accepted by the Hospital. She has since switched providers but the new coverage doesn't begin until the 1st of March. This means she will be absorbing the costs for the first month of cancer treatment which is likely going to be substantial. The overall cost is unknown but given the biopsies, drugs, pathology, chemotherapy,  and overnight stays, it could easily surpass $500,000 in just a few weeks.  Karina works as a Realtor with her husband Kevin who is now tasked with taking care of the kids and working as much as he can to support the family himself.  I have known Karina for only one year but already know she is a wonderful giving person who has had a positive effect on the lives of many others. I know from experience that suffering from Leukemia is a monumental challenge for any family. She will be bedridden for many months and likely unable to work for the rest of the year.This fund is being set up to help her family manage the financial costs it will be faced with once she overcomes this terrible disease.  If you or anyone you know has been blessed by knowing someone like Karina, please donate what you can and let's send Karina a message of appreciation and let her know that we all love her and appreciate the sweet spirit that she truly is.

I was diagnosed with Inborn Acute Lymphatic Leukemia. I want to live and I fight for my life very hard. Treatment in Ukraine had failed. At the moment my parents are searching for help from clinics abroad but the amount of money needed is enormous! To start we need about $50,000 for the tests and to put my condition into remission. I can't make it myself and asking for your kindness and help. If you want to donate any amount to give a chance to win this battle, you will find all information on this page or ask admin for assistance.Історія наша розпочалась з того, коли 9.03.2018р ми приїхали до лікарні ДМКЛ та Артемчика поклали до реанімації. Він був в тяжкому стані. На той момент було 99% ракових клітин в його крові... Було тяжко, страшно. Була паніка. Коли нам оголосили діагноз: ""Вроджений Гострий Лімфобластний Лейкоз"", світ рухнув з під ніг. Ми не знали що робити. Лікарі хорошого нічого не говорили. Але його витягли з реанімації та перевели до онкогематологічного відділення, де ми пролікувалися 4,5 місяці. За цей час ми пройшли Protokoll l, блок HR3, на фоні якого стався РЕЦИДИВ. Страшне слово... З 6,7% бластні клітини зросли до 72%. Реанжировка МLL гена в 80% нуклеїнових клітин. В Києві ми були 3 місяці, де пройшли блоки R2, R1 (Protokoll ALL-REZ BFM 2002); інтенсифікація терапії, блок MARMA ( Protokoll Interfant 2006). Після всього нас Київ направив на Полтаву на відновлення, обіцяючи взяти назад після результатів пункції. Та результати виявились невтішними. Київ вирішив, що ми безнадійні та відправив нас на паліативну хіміотерапію... Це означає, що поки Артем буде отримувати хімію, здержуються ракові клітини. Але наступає такий момент, що організм перестає реагувати на хімію, і все... Дитина помирає від раку. Дуже боляче. Я не можу передати, що коїться в мене в душі... Це жах... Знати, що твоя дитина невиліковно хвора і що в Україні ніхто її не вилікує. Є шанс тільки за кордоном. І, як не жахливо звучить, шанси мінімальні. Але поки є хоч один шанс, ми будемо боротися. Зараз для нас ціль - це РЕМІСІЯ. Вона необхідна для того, щоб зробити ТРАНСПЛАНТАЦІЮ КІСТКОВОГО МОЗКУ. Лікарня в Ізраїлі погодилась нас прийняти, на новітне лікування але воно дуже дороге. Рахунок на лікування ьа ткм біля 300 000$. В нас немає таких захмарних коштів. Тому звертаємося до всіх. ДОПОМОЖІТЬ ВРЯТУВАТИ СИНА!!! Ми не здамося!!!

She is a Loved Mother, Wife, Daughter, Grandmother, Mother in Law, Sister, Aunt, and Friend. 


She Loves God with All Her Heart! She is Young and Has the"" Fight in Her"" to Live! ( Her 55th Birthday is on May 31st) 


Everyone Who has Encountered My Mom, has been Blessed because She Loves with All She Has! 


My Mom has had a difficult 2 years fighting against Leukemia with numerous treatments of Chemotherapy, Blood Tranfusions, Medications, Bone Marrow Transplant , Tcell Infusion, and Sadly they have not been successful. The Drs have unfortunately run out of options and we are now relying solely on Faith. Per the Drs, Maria was given a few months of life here on earth. . . 


My Prayer is for her Total Complete Healing , but if the Good Lord decides to receive my ""Earthly Angel"" in His Arms, then My heart is to give her the Best Quality of Life, just by simply being By Her Side during the most difficult part of her life, by Loving her, Caring for Her, and spending as much time helping her through this process being that I am her only daughter and Our Bond is Unbreakable! (My younger Brother tragically passed away 6 years ago. Another difficult time in my mom's life. The beautiful part is that he left us with a Beautiful Boy who was 3 months in his wife's womb at the time, who is a Light of My Mom's Life. And Gives Her Another Reason To Live. You can find a Picture of Juniel attached) 


The reason I am doing this is because I Love My Mom! 


The situation is that I have been out on FMLA for 3 weeks since my mom was recently hospitalized and then sent home with No Hope from the Drs on her getting better. (We are Hoping/Praying for a Miracle)
So, recently I have completely run out of PTO due to caring for my mom. Travel expenses, medical bills and other expenses related to her care have increased. For a time, I've attempted other methods of income such as selling food but it is very time consuming and takes away time from my mom. 


Normally I Would NEVER Ask for financial assistance, yet due to My Desire to be there for My Mom, I have to Step Out in Faith, Humble Myself and make My Heart's desire known. 


The Lord says Ask and You Shall Receive, Knock and The Door Shall Open. . . So I Am Kindly and Humbly Knocking on Some Hearts in Hopes That God Would Opened Doors for My Mom to have me by her side. (Which I know is also her desire) 


❤ Please Pray With Me 
for Maria's Miracle!❤

Tiene apenas seis años. Es inteligente, tenaz y aguerrido en lo que se propone y para él  ha sido un don natural  “enamorar” a cuantos le conocen. El jueves 17 de Enero de 2019, se llevó a chequeo médico por una fiebre asintomática y el diagnóstico fue: Leucemia Linfoblástica aguda. Está hospitalizado en el Hospital de Clínicas Caracas, donde ayer, 22 de Enero comenzó a recibir quimioterapia.Luis Eduardo, es el sol que nutre a su madre Vanessa y a toda nuestra familia en Venezuela. Ahora yo tengo la oportunidad de ayudar a mi familia atravesar este camino doloroso. Nuestras familias se conocen desde los años 40, cuando mi abuela fue a Venezuela por primera vez. Desde entonces todas las generaciones siguientes han estado juntas de alguna manera u otra, especialmente en el amor que compartirmos hacia nuestro Dios y Salvador. Le doy gracias a Dios, que me ha permitido hacer posible esta campaña, porque Luis Eduardo, ya 5ta generación es como mi nieto, y tiene hermosos sueños, ilusiones y sobre todo, porque posee  un corazón que le hará convertirse en un maravilloso ser humano,  único y excepcional, como ha sido durante su corta niñez.  Pero para que su vida continúe y él pueda seguir iluminando nuestras vidas, necesita de tu ayuda, de la ayuda de todos, ya que su tratamiento implica una primera fase de quimioterapia diaria por un mes, durante el cual estará hospitalizado  y luego debe estar por 24 meses en un tratamiento ininterrumpido a fin de que la enfermedad desaparezca por completo. En Venezuela, el sistema de salud está completamente colapsado y los gastos clínicos y de medicamentos son muy costosos y difíciles de encontrar. En vista de que Luis Eduardo no cuenta con ningún seguro médico, todos los fondos recaudados con esta campaña serán usados en su totalidad para cubrir tanto los honorarios de la Clínica, que son muy elevados, como para la compra de los medicamentos que se requieren a fin de completar su tratamiento. Siendo aproximadamente $4000 para la fase inicial, del tratamiento, que incluye hospitalización y quimioterapia diaria por 1 mes, y luego $2000 mensuales durante 24 meses, que sería hospitalización por 1 semana y tramineto, dando un total aproximado de 52000 Dólares. Quisiera agregar que los fondos serán depositados o transferidos a la cuenta que el Hospital Clinicas Caracas tiene.en dólares igual que al médico tratantePor eso, mientras Luis Eduardo pelea la batalla por su vida, nosotros, junto a ustedes, quienes a partir de ahora, serán parte de nuestra familia, estaremos peleando la batalla económica que nos permita afrontar todo lo que viene por delante. Ayúdanos para que Luis Eduardo pueda levantar sus manos en agradecimiento a Dios por haberle enviado muchísimos ángeles, que como tú, se sumen a esta noble causa. Muchísimas gracias.Luis Eduardo…a little child with a big soul, he is a beautiful gift of life. He is only six years old. He is intelligent, tenacious and brave in what he sets his mind to do and for him is a natural gift to make all those who get to know him ""fall in love"" with him. On Thursday, January 17, 2019, he underwent a medical checkup for asymptomatic fever and the diagnosis was: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He is hospitalized at Hospital de Clinicas Caracas, where yesterday, January 22, he began receiving chemotherapy.Luis Eduardo, is the sun that nourishes his mother Vanessa and our whole family in Venezuela. And now I have the opportunity to help my family make it through this difficult and painful path. My name is Karen and I thank God he has allowed me to make this campaign possible. Our families have known each other ever since my grandmother went to Venezuela during the 40's.  Five generations of families together helping each other and know Luis Eduardo, Vanessa's son, I feel he is like my own grandson, I have to see him grow because Luis Eduardo has beautiful dreams, illusions and above all, because he has a heart that will make him become a wonderful human being, unique and exceptional, as he has been during his short childhood.But for his life to continue, and he can continue illuminating our lives, he needs your help, the help of all, because his treatment involves a first phase of daily chemotherapy for a month  in which he will be hospitalized, and then he must be in an uninterrupted treatment for 24 months in order for the disease to disappear completely. I must ad the funds will be deposited or transferred to the hospital account in Commerce Bank in dollars and also to the.doctor's account.In Venezuela, the health system has completely collapsed, and medical and drug costs are very expensive and difficult to find. Given that Luis Eduardo does not have any medical insurance, all the funds raised with this campaign will be used in full to cover the Clinic's fees, which are very high, as well as for the purchase of the drugs for the treatment, food and other supplies needed for his recovery. So for the first month  the doctor said  the initial phase of the treatment is US$ 4000 and then US$ 2000 monthly for 24 months, giving a total of approximately $ 52,000. These numbers  seems so unreachable and the only way we can even get started is through this way of raising funds because the amount seems out of this world That is why, while Luis Eduardo fights the battle for his life, we, together with you, who from now on, will be part of our family, will be fighting the economic battle and many difficulties we may have to face from now on. Help us so that Luis Eduardo can raise his hands in gratitude to God for having sent him so many angels, who like you, will join this noble cause.Thank you so much!",a325b637478942d56b97a13679e2fede,29,0.07407692307692308,18.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

If all goes well, Angelina can come home after one month and will visit the hospital once a week for additional chemo treatments. This is what they refer to as the 'consolidation phase', and usually lasts 4-6 months. Finally,  if all continues to go well, she will proceed into the maintenance phase of chemo treatments for an additional 2-3 years. I am asking for your help so that Michael and Mayra can take time from their jobs and be by Angelina's side at the hospital during this initial phase, as you can imagine how frightened she is. Mike and Mayra will be struggling enough emotionally, if I can help ease their financial struggles, I know it will help them a lot to focus on what's most important! It is my hope and prayer that through family and friends, we can help them navigate through this difficult time so they can be there for Angelina. Her first words to her Dad upon hearing her diagnosis were, ""Am I going to die?"" I can't imagine what it felt like to hear their little girl say those words! Please keep Angelina in your prayers! She is one tenacious little girl and I know through our prayers and her resilience, she is going to fight this!   Love and blessings to all!The Domenici Family",217a2f905453b62086520016de4f793e,18,3.721,570.0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Each time, he has been successfully treated and put in to remission, however, the treatment options are dwindling. His father is also a member and is a Captain with our department. Last year, Bo received a bone marrow transplant and was well on his way to recovery. In October 2015, while on a Father-Son ""dream trip"" to the Yukon, Bo received the bad news from the doctors that the ALL had returned for a 3rd time. The doctors say that if even only one of the leukemia cells didn't die after his last chemo, radiation and marrow transplant, it could have grown and multiplied and only become detectable now. Apparently, the bone marrow donor cells are supposed to fight off any remaining leukemia cells, but it's possible the donor cells weren't strong enough either. As the leukemia cells grow, they can block out the healthy donor cells as in any other patient. Bo is now in Calgary, and is undergoing treatment with an experimental drug called Blinatumomab. The Tom Baker Cancer Clinic needed to get special approval to use this drug. The hope was that the drug would put Bo into full remission in about 24-50 days, and then he could possibly have another bone marrow transplant from a different donor. Now, the doctors are reccomending preparation for travel to one of 3 potential locations in the USA to undergo treatment with more promissing experimental Car T Cell drugs.  The family needs to quickly come up with atleast $500 000.00 to recieve the treatment.  They are trying liquidate any assets, but the process is slow.   The doctors are being frank and honest at this point, they really do not know what his chances are. He has had his lifetime dose of Chemotherapy, so treatment options are becoming slim. Bo will remain in Calgary, until he is able to travel for  treatment. He exhausted his financial support to stay at the housing unit for the Tom Baker Cancer Clinic during his last treatment phase, so the cost of accommodation, transportation, etc are up to him. We are fundraising at the local level as well, but a greater influx of support would be more helpful. At this point and time, any financial support from the public would be greatly appreciated. Bo and his family are not people who have ever asked for support, and are deeply appreciative of the possible benefit of this campaign.  Bo is just 26 years old and newly married.  He worked as a volunteeer Fire Fighter until he was hired by the Fort McMurray Fire Department in 2009.  Please consider assisting this family in need.  We thank you in advance for your kindness.",9d43deda605b496d31ecc1f4b9d569f4,25,0.617398,1170.0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Было много разных вариантов, которые исключались по мере сдачи того или иного анализа.Что же со мной всё таки не так, при том что чувствую я себя достаточно неплохо. И так проследовав всю пирамиду медицинской иерархии, я добрался на приём к врачу-гематологу, за пару дней до Нового Года. Показываю ему это «ожерелье» на шее,а он в ответ: «На 95% уверен что всё впорядке, это может быть реакция на инфекцию,давай для полной уверенности сделаем несколько анализов - маркеров определенных заболеваний». Я конечно хотел было согласиться с его 95 процентной частью, но внутренний голос давал понять что эта 5ка не даст мне спать спокойно.Да и узлы как были так и оставались. Так как врач этот был работником одной из частных клиник,да и позиция у него не самая популярная в том заведении,он принимает раз в неделю, плюс наложились на это ещё и новогодние дни, а там сразу посленовогодний проект. Вообщем не с пустыми же руками к нему было возвращаться, нужны доп обследования,требующие времени на сдачу. Прикинув перспективы по занятости, записался к нему на приём, через 10 дней. Стали эти дни тянуться страшно долго, так как ожидание моё было непередаваемым, очень хотелось поскорее исключить все предположения и наконец расслабиться,тем временем перебирая шею в поисках узлов каждый день по 100 раз, как охотник за золотом мутную глину в реке, только моя ежедневная цель была обратной, не найти их. И вот финишная прямая, забираю последние результаты обследований и направляюсь на встречу к врачу. Приехал на место немного заранее, примерно за час, ну чтобы не опоздать.Отсидел это время частично в машине, частично в дороговалютном коридоре, обрамлённом лепниной и картинами в позолоченных рамках. Зовут, захожу, выкладываю свои «карты» на стол, предварительно расположив их в нужном порядке. Он смотрит, один-второй лист, вот думаю сейчас скажет иди уже отсюда и не придумывай, больше спи, здоровее ешь и радуйся. В ответ на моё ожидание вопрос: «У тебя регистрация киевская?». Киваю, что да (про это отдельный разговор).И получаю напутствие на дообследование уже в специализированном гос учреждении, с комментарием,что есть патология костного мозга, делай пункцию, они точно скажут какая, намекая на то,что лекарства через гос учреждение дешевле.Загудело в ушах, киваю, спрашиваю насколько это страшно, понятное дело не получаю ответов, так как на то оно и дообследование.Вот ещё одна надежда на сбой в иммунитете (как решил мой внутренний врач) рухнула. Выхожу из клиники,не снимая бахил, иду к машине, набирая при этом Дашу, которая как и я все эти недели волнуется вместе со мной.На следующее утро, едем уже вдвоём в городскую поликлинику. Захожу в ещё один кабинет, получаю направление в гематологическое отделение больницы, со словами: «проблема серьёзная хлопчик». Следующий шаг - больница, показываю результаты, направление, слышу всё те же подозрения только с ещё более подробными деталями и в конце: «надо дообследоваться, ложись на стационар, как только будет свободное место, набери через пару часов, может освободится». Этот день была пятница, жаль что не 13го, потому как 13е моё счастливое число. Спустя несколько часов в трубке телефона говорят,что в понедельник в 8:30 меня ждут с вещами на заселение. Ну я же неплохо себя чувствую, что они говорят? - думаю я.И ещё миллион мыслей,от которых всё плывёт вокруг.Но отказать врачам в их рекомендациях не получается.И вот понедельник, мы с Дашей, в руках мои пожитки для больницы, кладу вещи в палату, жду каких то конкретных, точных действий, наступает ожидание, но уже больничное, начало знакомства с госпитальным бытом, зрачки расширяются.Делают пункцию, ощущение как будто шприцом тянут из груди душу, кто делал поймёт.Несёмся чтобы успеть до закрытия сдать полученный образец в 2 разных лаборатории, которые этим дерьмом занимаются на клеточном уровне. Денёк ещё тот, один из тех в конце которого хочется выпить.Но был и позитивный момент дня, что мне не надо возвращаться ночевать в больнице. Следующие 5ть дней были как это называется в режиме дневного стационара, в режиме спокойного обследования-наблюдения. Всю неделю продолжаю трогать эти узлы, в надежде изменений. И действительно они стали немного меньше, а моя вера в хороший результат пункции больше.Мыслей такое количество, что они не дают мне спать, поневоле прорабатываю все возможные сценарии развития, от которых бросает в пот-холод-пот-холод. Спустя несколько дней, на подсознании я готов ко всему, но волнуюсь за тех кто рядом, оно есть. В конце рабочей недели, по дороге из больницы домой, звонок на телефон: «результат готов, куда отправлять, кто ваш врач?». В режиме левитации направляюсь домой. С этого момента становится темно...Итак, перед Вами человек со сбоем работы формулы крови, который врачи называют лейкемия. Человек, который готов и морально и физически бороться и побеждать. Но я знаю точно, этот путь можно преодолеть только командой при правильной стратегии.Приняли решение не откладывать и ложиться как можно раньше на стационар для начала химиотерапии. Сейчас много всего сложного нового сыпется, и к сожалению не только на меня, а и на моих близких, они те, кому сейчас нужна моральная поддержка больше чем мне.Уверен многие из вас откликнутся помочь и это действительно понадобится совсем скоро. Первое скорее всего что будет нужно, это люди с 2+ кровью для сдачи. (Второй положительной). Пожалуйста пишите в личку кто не против поделиться.P.S. На фото я, после знакомства с первой химией. Познакомились,немного мутило, но ничего криминального.Будем обнулять систему и дальше.#bloodyresort////////////////////This day is the day when the new stage of my life and life of my close people starts.Last 1,5 months I’ve spent in between appointments with different doctors in searching answer for questions: why lymph nodes on my neck showed up? Full blood count said that there are some indexes out of normal. It was many different presumtions on this case which were excluded with different tests. So what is wrong with me? Btw I fell myself pretty normal. Just before the New Year after I’ve made a way trough a whole medical hierarchy I finally got an appointment with a doctor who’s named Hematologist. So I’m at his office showing him my “necklace” made of lymph nodes. He responds to this with words: “I’m 95% sure that this not a problem,it can be reaction onto some infection. But to be on 100% let’s do some more tests - markers to exclude anything completely”.I’ve almost agreed with his 95% presumption but this shitty 5% will not keep me calm. And lymph nodes still here I can feel them.As this doctor was from a private clinic and his position not really popular over there possibility for the next appointment was in a week but because of the New Years holidays and music video project that I had it wasn’t enough time for me to manage new tests before I met him again. So I decided to come back to him in 10 days.That were loooong days of waiting.I was dreaming about to finish this asap and relax meanwhile I’ve been checking bulbs on my neck as golddiger checking myddy water but my goal was an opposite just not to find them. Days were lasting and here is the finishing line comes closer.I take my latest results and take off to the clinic. Got there 1 hour before slightly earlier not to be late. Half of this time I spent in a car and the other half at the extremely poshy clinic’s lobby with the pictures in golden frames. I’m hearing my name, entering door and putting my cards on doctors table. Still believe that he is going to tell me that everything is fine just normalize your daily routine. In answer to my waiting I got question: “Do you have Kyiv registration or the other one?”My nod in respond which means yes.And following: “you need to pass some extra tests it can be some pathology of bone marrow, punction needed, better to go to govermental clinic it will be cheaper and they have some support there”.So my feeling about some immune disease broke apart ( that was diagnose from my inner doctor, i’m sure everyone has his own). I’m getting out from clinic in surgery boots heading to the car on a way calling to Dasha she has been living trough this with me.Next morning together with her going to city clinic. Entering office, receiving medical refer from doctor with words: “problem is serious boy”.Next step hospital, showing my results, same suspicions that I’ve heard before already but with more details and in the end: “ you need to stay stationary at the hospital for extra tests, call us in few hours maybe we will have bed for you”.But I feel myself ok, why hospital?That was a Friday, unfortunately not 13th because 13 is my lucky number.Later trough the cellphone I hear: “come in on Monday and we will start - that was a doctor.”Next Monday we getting back with Dasha to the hospital with all stuff that you possibly could need, first introduction with hospital’s life.Long waiting, then sternal punction, this feeling when someone trying to suck your soul out of the chest.Flying with material to 2 different laboratories for more tests, they make this shit on cellular level.That was a day one of these when in the end of it you want to drink some strong alcohol.Next 5 days in observing mode at the hospital, one good thing that you don’t need to do is to stay there overnight.Keep touching my nodes in hope. And they really became smaller and with this my expectations for punction results bigger.Many thoughts in my head: what? if?how? where? and etc. Can’t sleep at night keep thinking about possible future scenarios. In few days I’ve managed myself to be ready to face to any results but still thinking about people around me.To strong.In the end of the week I recieved a call: “your results ready, where i need to send it, who is your doctor?”In result after 1,5 months of research guy in front of you diagnosed with a bug of the blood’s system formula which doctors call leukemia.This guy physically and mentally ready for fight and win.But I know for sure you can made this way only with a strong team and a right strategy. We decided not to delay and start chemotherapy on the next day. Doctors said they knew diagnosis week ago so they ready to provide me with a program.Right now many things falling on top of the head, unfortunately not only mine’s head but my relatives also. They are the ones who need support more then me right now.I’m sure many of you ready to help and it’s definitely will be needed very soon. First what I would ask you, probably soon I will need 2+ blood for blood transfusion (Second Positive).Write me down in dm who are ready to share some (if you are in Kyiv).P.S. Here is me on photo after first meeting with chemistry. Feels good by now.

He is currently at UC San Diego Health Jacobs Medical Center in La Jolla and will be there for 3-4 weeks undergoing initial chemotherapy treatment. After this a bone marrow transplant or stem cell transplant may be required. His full treatment plan is not yet determined.Matt’s illness evaded doctors for the past 8-months as his energy was drained, he experienced out-of-control weight loss and faced excruciating pain in his bones & joints. While not the diagnosis we were all hoping for it does answer the mystery and allows him, his family and his doctors to build and execute a plan fight-through and beat this cancer.Matt’s wife Candace and their two boys Max & Gray could use some help from the village. While Matt is tied-up let’s pitch-in to help with the incremental costs they will have like hotel bills for the family to be near the hospital, extra take-out food expenses, babysitting as everything falls onto Candace’s shoulders, fund the inevitable home emergency that Matt would normally handle, get a maid to help with laundry & cleaning, you get the idea- the extra costs they will experience and offer some support so Matt’s family can be there for him.Feel free to spread the word to other’s who may want to help.Update 1/12 from Matt-I got the full diagnoses.

A good friend of mine Shawn Symington and her family are going through that one thing that we all fear, being told that someone that means the world to you may die much sooner than you thought due to CANCER. Many of you may know or recognize Shawn from being a long time resident of Plaquemine Parish and has been  working at Balestra's  for the past 11 years. Her husband James has worked as a diesel mechanic for quite some time now and has always been very good at what he does, even though work kept him away from home quite a bit he did what he had to do for his family. When James was home he would spend as much time with his wife and two young sons, Jaison 11, who attends Belle Chasse middle and Tristan 10, who attends Belle Chasse Primary, as possible. His boys are always so happy to see their daddy and both look up to him tremendously. James has always been a kind man doing what he can for anyone that is in need, family, friend or even a stranger. That’s why when he fell ill it was so hard on everyone that knows him. Initially James went to the Doctor to have his knee checked for unbearable pain, first he was told it was stemming from his back. Then came all the testing! Scans and poking and prodding and they found nothing. His Doctor decided to do a bone density scan on him, which required labs and basic surgery prep. Still waiting for the approval for the scan , one morning James woke up to his wife asking him if he maybe fell out of the bed or smacked his head during the night because he had a pretty big gash on his head and was bleeding. James didn’t recall falling or hurting himself, so it was assumed he just did it in his sleep. Well the days following James developed several more of these mysterious spots on his body which were painful and bleeding. Assuming it was a case of the shingles he headed to his Doctor to have it checked out. THAT DAY THEIR LIFE CHANGED! Once they arrived at the office the Doctor informed them that his bloodwork came back with some scary results and his white blood count was triple what it should be and that could only mean one thing, Leukemia. James was admitted that day into Tulane and put into isolation because at this point they were not sure what type of leukemia it was and if he did in fact have shingles or if it was a result of the cancer. It took about a week of being in the hospital before they knew for sur what type of Leukemia he has which is CML (Chronic myeloid leukemia), on a grading scale it’s one of the worst kind, not that any are a good kind but it’s a very rare and aggressive type of Leukemia. He was in what they call blast phase which is extremely bad, come to find out that sores he has all over his body were NOT shingles but a result of the leukemia. It was basically causing his blood platelets to burst which was causing bruising and sores all over his body. They instantly started Chemo and he had to say in the hospital for 37 days, which of course led to several more long stays. Time away from his children and work and Time his wife had to take off of work. Since being diagnosed James has tried his best to continue to work, be it from home or just lite duty in the office but now that is no longer an option. Starting in October he will no longer have his job and will lose his benefits as well as his insurance. He’s been in and out of the hospital so much I’ve lost count. Every time he’s gotten a chemo treatment he ends up in the hospital for one reason or another due to his depleted nonexistent immune system. His last treatment he ended up catching a nasty intestinal infection and that was yet another week in the hospital for antibiotics. He will be needing to go through a stem cell transplant very soon and when that happens his wife will need to be with him as much as possible. He will not be allowed to be around pets or children under the age of 14, which means he will not see his boys for 100 days if everything goes well. The little income Shawn will be bringing in will barley be enough to feed them let alone pay the bills to keep their home and vehicle.  This is a very humble family and I have seen both Shawn and James go above and beyond to help others in need and now it’s their turn to be the ones in need.  This has been a very rough year for this family with Shawn suddenly losing her brother T.J. last month and literally fighting for James’s life, trying to keep it together and raising 2 young boys I’m just not sure how she does it. I know that if we can ban together and give them one less thing to worry about, one less heart ache, make things go just a little bit smoother it may be just a little donation out of your pocket but it would make the world of difference for them.BELOW IS A LINK WITH A VIDEO, it explains they type of cancer they are dealing with http://www.cancercenter.com/leukemia/types/tab/chronic-myeloid-leukemia/",727ef8fd86383962b1948de65653cae3,35,0.06652,840.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I was first diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia 2 years ago in September 2015. A chemotherapy option was presented to me in pill form but would compromise my ability to ever have children naturally while on it. In order to get the leukemia in remission, I would have to take the pill for the rest of my life. Once off of it, the leukemia returns.  It is a very serious blood cancer that without treatment, expectancy for survival is 2 years after diagnosis. Although I've lived longer than expected without treatment, the time has come where it is necessary for survival. I went as long as I could without taking the pill.  I tried it on my own with organic food options but with medical bills of recurring blood tests, that's not always affordable option as a single woman that supports herself.  My blood test results a few weeks ago just past the 2 year mark, showed a dramatic rise in my white blood cell count into dangerous levels where I was hospitalized last week to start the chemotherapy treatment as an emergency to save my life.  I am right on the cusp of the only cure known in the states covered by insurance being a bone marrow donor along with aggressive chemotherapy that comes with many complications.  Hopefully, the chemotherapy treatment I am currently on will be effective. But even at it's most effective, is still NOT A CURE. The leukemia had hijacked my system so much that I needed a blood transfusion to bring up my red blood cell count while in the hospital.The way it's been explained to me is that once your body's immune system has been compromised for a period of time, it is very hard to recover. It's like a bear has been chasing you for a really long time and the body is tired and worn out. The toll cancer takes on you emotionally and physically is almost too much to bare sometimes. There is a known cure for my type of leukemia in Arizona at New Hope Unlimited where they use all natural procedures to clean the blood with ultraviolet rays and bring your body back to balance with your own T-cells to fight the disease without chemotherapy which causes further damage over time. It is a 12 day procedure with only a 4 month follow up locally where I live in South Florida. It is the CURE, not a band aid.  It has a very high success rate.The procedure is not covered by insurance and costs 28,000.  That along with flights, other travel expenses, time taken off work without pay and other medical bills- I'm looking to raise 35,000 as my goal.  I may not hit that, but any amount counts.  The longer I wait, the more damage is being done to my body in the long run.  Any amount that exceeds that, I would like to pay forward to another cause close to my heart on Gofundme. Although I have cancer, I refuse to be defined by it.  I am not Jennifer who has cancer.  I am Jennifer.  I have dreams, hopes, and desires that I refuse to let cancer have. I've been lucky to work with Carnival Cruise Line for the past 2 years and happy to share in the experiences of booking cruises for everything from Honeymoons to Anniversaries, Graduations and for many other cancer fighters and SURVIVORS celebrating their lives and I desire the same for my own life.  I would love the opportunity to be married and have my own children still even though some say it's getting harder to do at my age. It's my dream to sing one day also and although I'm doing that now, I want to do it CANCER FREE and with a testimony in my heart to sing about forever!  With a story to tell my children, that there are still wonderful people in this world who love. I also want to give others hope that have been fighting all kinds of cancers themselves, that they are not alone in the journey and that there are other options out there.  I want to take you along the journey and document the progress. I want to be the example of someone who has SURVIVED!I am asking that you join this fight with me.  With the strength of God, I wish you to help me in taking back my life…with a view to a wonderful future.""",5dd55d271fd54456a367211acbe5493c,37,0.19,420.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

The doctors have shared that A.L.L. is extremely rare in adults (this is usually only seen in young children) and especially rare in those who are 28 years old and in top physical condition.  Andrew always stays in great shape so the diagnosis is even surprising to the doctors. The good news here, however, is that B cell - A.L.L. is supposed to be curable; so that’s our new goal.The plan of attack going forward makes a lot of sense: · Andrew’s bone marrow biopsy came back negative for the Philadelphia mutation. The doctors say that with the Philadelphia chromosome not being present Andrew may not need a stem cell transplant. Still too early to know for sure because we have to see how Andrew responds to the IV chemo. · Since Thursday (1/18/18) Andrew has been taking oral chemo and steroids. These medications have really been effective. His white blood cell count has dropped from 424,000 (normal is <10,000) to about 1 as of yesterday morning.  Again, this is a very good sign. His red blood cells and his platelets and many, many other tests are coming back strong.  More good signs.This past Tuesday, Andrew started with a spinal tap & direct chemotherapy treatment in his spinal cord. This is day one of what we are calling the 28-day war.· For the next ~28 days Andrew will be undergoing very aggressive chemotherapy treatments. This is our aggressive attack on his cancer cells using IV chemotherapy. The intent here is to kill off all cancerous white blood cells, red blood cells, stem cells and everything and anything in his body related to cancer. The end goal of this attack is 100% complete remission.· After we successfully achieve full remission, we enter into another phase whereby we want to maintain that full remission over time. Yes, this means more chemo, but perhaps we can get Andrew home during this ~9-week phase. Massachusetts General Hospital works right alongside the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit.  Andrew’s doctors are starting to arrange treatments for him at Karmanos so he can come home for a while. Nothing like mom’s homemade cookies, Belgian sausage and cheesy potatoes to help him feel better! We’ll see if/when we can swing getting him home.· During that 9-week phase there will be some days where Andrew feels great and other days when Andrew feels very sick. We will play it day-to-day, keep asking God for His grace & blessings and thank Him for all we’ve already achieved.· Should we successfully achieve 9 weeks of maintained remission, then we enter the next, more prolonged phase. This is when Andrew should be able to get back to work while still maintaining a rather less taxing chemo treatment schedule.  Nothing 100% guaranteed but step by step. ·Andrew will be undergoing chemotherapy for the next 2.5 years. He will lose his hair. He will be physically and emotionally challenged by his cancer and the life-saving treatments he has ahead of him. It will not be easy. Although his insurance will help him cover a lot of the medical expenses (estimated to be around 1 million dollars in cost), the co-pay over the next 2.5 years is nearly $25,000 out of pocket. Unfortunately, Andrew will not be able to work until further notice making it difficult to cover these costs. Please help us help Andrew during this difficult time. We appreciate all the love and support. Andrew is strong and he will get through this, but he won't be able to do it without the support of his family, friends and God.  He will fight this fight, come out strong & beat this cancer. ""Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.""",837e9f7a287f955e3069b6dafa1919a8,38,1.1044,360.0,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

This was the first indication that her situation was not going to be simple.Sylvia is the 4-year-old daughter of Maxine, who has been preparing to enter nursing school, and Charles, a disabled war veteran of both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army. Last November, Sylvia had to be taken to multiple doctors for issues resembling different infections, and then finally anemia. A week and a half before Christmas 2018, she was diagnosed with Acute L Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and emergency transported from St. Francis Hospital in Tulsa, OK to St. Jude Medical Research Hospital in Memphis, TN to begin chemotherapy and other treatments. Both parents have had to completely put their careers on hold to be with their daughter in Memphis, leaving their family with no income, in order to insure that she has 24/7 care and attention. Sylvia’s older two siblings have had to move in with their grandmother in Oklahoma to continue school throughout this processThe St. Jude staff is amazing, and constantly saying that they are in love with Sylvia’s positive and playful attitude. Treatment has been rough on Sylvia due to the fact that her blood has a specific antibody that makes finding supplemental red cells harder, as well as discovering allergies to certain chemotherapy medications.It is nearly impossible to map out what lies ahead. Charles and Maxine were informed they will have to heavily modify the house, that they currently have on a rent to own contract, in order to keep infections and germs away, or forfeit everything that they have invested to relocate. They will have to maintain a near sterile environment, while attempting to accommodate a childhood that is as normal as possible.All donations received will be used as follows:1. Cover any medical situation or supplies outside of the scope of what’s covered by St. Jude.2. Either effect modifications and improvements to their current house, or relocate to a house where no modifications are necessary.3. Dependable transportation enabling Sylvia’s movement between their home, the Saint Francis Hospital in Tulsa where will be doing her chemo and regular checkups, and St. Jude in Memphis where she will be required to go monthly to assess herprogress over the next three years.4.

As a healthy, active person my entire life, it was a shocking diagnosis but through multiple rounds of chemo and surgeries, my breast cancer successfully went into remission. You can read more about that here . In June 2018,  however, my body began to feel strange. My bones ached and walking on my right leg became difficult. They told me I had a pulled muscle - I like to run miles, go on rigorous hikes in the Columbia River Gorge, climb mountains. But I pushed for more tests and my oncologist advocated for them, pressing for answers because very quickly it became apparent that it wasn't just an athletic injury. The tests were fine at first but then...they weren’t. Then I was diagnosed with something crushing. Leukemia feels like a loaded word. I can’t quite wrap my head around it. I think about all of the other ways I wanted life to look like and couldn’t have imagined this in a million years. They tell me it's incredibly rare, less than 1% of cases, but that it happens and that it's a direct result of the chemo they gave me for breast cancer and that there's nothing I could have done to prevent it. UPDATE 1: I was immediately admitted to the hospital following my diagnosis and in-patient for 4-6 weeks for 7 days of continuous chemo while we wait for the results of my bone marrow biopsy to find out if I'll need a bone marrow transplant. In the past ten years, I've been busy building my career by going to grad school and working full-time in advertising and social media. I'm also an artist . However, in light of this ongoing, rigorous treatment for leukemia I've chosen to pause work for the moment and most likely won't resume for at least a year. UPDATE 2: Maintenance chemo took me back into the hospital but we're still in remission! UPDATE 3: The support has been absolutely overwhelming and I can't thank everyone enough for your generosity! We have a fundraiser coming up later this year, but in the meantime, it looks like I'm most likely need to have a bone marrow transplant. If you're curious, here are links to the national bone marrow database below. Consider signing up for the registry and donating today!  https://bethematch.org  https://bethematch.org/patients-and-families/about-transplant/what-is-a-bone-marrow-transplant UPDATE 4 (12/15): I'm successfully out of my bone marrow transplant! My Day Zero, my new Re-brthday!, happened the day before Thanksgiving and I spent about three and a half weeks total but am home now. Day +24! We're keeping an eye out for any complications but so far so good - I'm up and about walking every day, staying active, visiting with friends here at my house, and making art. Next big milestones: Get to Day 100 without major incident (that's a super crucial window right after a transplant), celebrate my birthday on February 14 and one year anniversary with my love, and a California road trip in April. Until then, it's one day at a time, eyes on the prize. The funds I raise here will help cover my medical bills that could eventually be more than $100k along with the $15k I still have from my breast cancer treatment. They'll help cover my living expenses and bills while I'm out of work with the most immediate needs covering housing, medical bills, and my car. This was not planned and it hurts my heart in so many ways to go through it again, but I've fought like hell before to heal and I'll do it again. I want this to mean something not only to me but to inspire everyone that's on this journey with me. Thank you for everything!

The team of doctors at Northside Cancer institute is confident that if Skip goes through the transplant procedure in the next few weeks he has 60-70% chance of being cured within a year- if he doesn't the prognosis is that his blood cells will continue to mutate untill he reaches a blast phase when nothing can be done to prevent the cancer from taking his life. Fortinately for Skip, his son Tate is a match and is willing to become a donor. Unfortunatelly, the recovery from such a complicated procedure is 6-12 months. Even if everything goes well, Skip will not be able to work or be in public for at least 6 months because he will have no immune system to protect him. He will need a 24 hour care giver to take him daily to the hospital for blood transfussions for a period of at least 3 months. His wife Deni will have to care for him and their 4 year old son, while trying to work and pay all the bills- a task almost impossible without some help from family and friends. We are asking you kindly to help this family financially survive this hard period in their lives. Let us take part of the burden they are facing and let us give them the piece of mind that at the end of the day they will have a roof over their heads and their utility bills will be paid so they can focus on getting Skip better and winning the fight against cancer!

Aiden was just getting ready to celebrate his 14th birthday August 11th and starting his first day of high school the 14th. 


Aiden is a charming, affectionate, creative, and a loving brother to his 3 siblings. Aiden was always seen participating in choir, school plays, and getting great grades. He already misses home, and has been positive so far with this diagnosis. He says everyday that ""God is with me, and will heal me from this disease."" We’re hoping to raise funds that can go towards Aiden's medical expenses, and his needs during this journey. As it's only just beginning, our family needs all the support we can get. Any donation will help our family out, including your prayers.

After numerous tests, and several days in the hospital, on March 13th, 2018 our baby boy Bryce was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL). Initially, it was devastating. Mind crippling. We could not fathom that our boy, our son, was diagnosed with such a thing at the age of 3yrs old.  Its something no parent ever wants to hear. But as Isaiah 53:5 says, ""But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed."". And I believe with all my heart he will be healed. In Jesus Name. As a result, Bryce has began chemotherapy treatments to treat the Leukemia and is scheduled to continue them for several months going forward. This diagnosis came 2 days before we were scheduled to relocate to the DMV area as his parents had accepted positions in Washington, DC. Of course this has put a hold on the move, as well as I, his mother, will be no longer able to work. I will be the primary caregiver for my son during this time. We have been contacted by several friends and family members wanting to help, so we have created this GoFundMe to help with expenses associated with his future care, as well as his transfer to the Washington National Children's Hospital in a couple weeks.

Acute Myeloid Leukemia is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in the bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cells. Symptoms may include feeling tired, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. AML progresses rapidly very rapidly. If it was not for an infection that brought him to the emergency room at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida we would have never known. There is no genetic trend for Hunter's diagnosis, it was completely random. His first day being admitted he was having an internal breathing problem and was immediately put on oxygen. As of October 17, 2018 he was clear and was no longer dependent from an oxygen tank. He will be hospitalized for a month while starting chemotherapy which he is reacting well to. The treatment plan he is on is 7+3.  He will be receiving chemotherapy for seven days and the +3 is two rounds of chemotherapy for the first three days which leads to the four days of standard chemotherapy. The chemotherapy is continuous, twenty-four hours for the entire week. He was accepted in a clinical trial which is allowing him to receive the highest dose of stem cells starting October  23, 2018. After Hunter gets into remission he will be having to follow up monthly with chemotherapy. We would appreciate any donation to help assist the family with the financial burden.

I was immediately admitted into the hospital, it was a Friday. My world began to fall apart as they poked and proded. My body was suffocating and doctors didn't expect me to live through the night. The over population of white blood cells was preventing red blood cells from delivering oxygen to my organs so my body was shutting down. I didn't look ill and the only symptoms were like the flu or bronchitis until I was passing out and lethargic. The reality was the capillaries in my lungs were bleeding, I have damage to a valve in my heart from it overworking, my kidneys were shutting down and my spleen was enlarged. I lost my job and lost my home due to no longer being able to work. I stay with my young adult sons who struggle to make the ends meet. I've spent the last 8 months in and out of the hospital having high dose chemo, fighting fevers and infections from being neutropenic and fighting to live. I have good and bad days and I try to smile through the pain, nausea, fear and recently I began having tremors in my hands. I tire easily when out and about and it reminds me I'm not well when I try to forget. I need help since I've been unable to work it's not something I can manage alone. My best chance is a bone marrow transplant and there will be post operative living expenses to be able to stay near hospital.I lost my husband to a heart attack last year and my mom after 3 days in ICU so I have no outside financial support.

Maybe even to the point where we stop appreciating the seconds, minutes and hours that we are all afforded. Time gives us the ability to compile handfuls of instances over a lifetime that we are fortunate to reflect on. These memories sometimes bring smiles, some anger and some tears. We reflect on these memories and they help develop a timeline which we eventually call a life. Occasionally things happen that we cannot explain or justify and they tend to leave a lasting impression. We write to you with an appeal, an appeal for a little girl named Delaney Fate DeVerna born April 24, 2014. Those of you that are parents, grandparents and family members, can attest that the birth of a child is a moment in time, an instance, a memory that is everlasting. The anticipation of the many years that will follow can be nerve racking, challenging, but most of all rewarding. We all know that life can also bring the unexpected. On October 7, 2015 the unexpected happened, Delaney was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia. During that year she went through multiple rounds of chemo and was flown to Denver Children's Hospital for a bone marrow transplant. Delaney is a fighter, Delaney never lost her smile, and nearly 10 months later Delaney was put into remission and was allowed to come home. On November 11, 2016 we found out that Delaney's Leukemia had returned. Since then Delaney was flown back to Denver Children's Hospital in hopes to get a 2nd bone marrow transplant. On March 23rd we received the most difficult news, the leukemia was no longer responding to treatment and under the advisement of her doctors, it was recommended that Delaney be allowed to return home. Our only goal now…. to provide Delaney with every smile, every hug, every kiss and as many precious memories that this little angel deserves. Life changes when time is no longer infinite, and as we begin to prepare we ask for your support. The upcoming expenses will be difficult, not only emotionally but financially and we ask that you please consider a donation. All donations will go directly to Delaney’s immediate care and eventually for her services. If you are not in a position to donate financially we only ask that you continue your prayers, continue your kindness, and continue your outpouring of love for this little girl!!",5f591b3ae6deeeecad93ee25a98d0e1c,23,0.18333333333333332,660.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Typically we would let the fever play out over a few days with Tylenol and Motrin but this time Landon wasn't complaining of anything hurting or upsetting him. We took him to the Pediatricians office that afternoon and they ordered an Ultrasound which we completed on Tuesday and a Blood Test which was completed on Wednesday. The Pediatrician predicted that he had Mono (the kissing disease) which would cause his spleen and liver to be enlarged and cause him to spike a fever since his body was fighting a virus.After the blood work on Wednesday (January 18th), We received a call from the doctors office at 4:30PM saying his white blood cell count was a little high and his hemoglobin count was a little low which could indicate that he could be ""anemic"" but unfortunately we would need to go straight to the hospital as they were admitting him that night and a room would be waiting for us when we got there.As we sat in his hospital room waiting, it was becoming more and more clear that the staff around us knew more than we did. Landon was hooked up to IV’s and he would say repeatedly that he just wanted to go home but we could not confidently tell our son to not worry or that everything was going to be okay. As we sat there, the doctor came in and we could tell by the way that she was easing into the conversation that what we were about to hear was going to change our lives forever. That moment our entire world turned upside, medical words had no meaning to us, and we had to come to terms with the ""C"" word for our one and only 4 year old son.Landon had no idea that this meant no more school, hanging out with friends every weekend, sporadic Disney trips, or even trips to Target or Publix on a normal basis. He had no idea that every night or day was going to be a surprise and every moment after that would follow an on going doctors appointment which could be daily, weekly, or monthly, hospital trips at any moment, and chemo treatments frequently. How exactly do you tell a 4 year old this kind of news?The oncologist came in shortly after to confirm the diagnosis of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Landon's white cell count was as high as 71,000 (average children who get diagnosed are at 51,000) which made Landon in the high risk range. The following day we completed the port surgery, bone marrow, and our first spinal tap to start treatment. After constant prayer, we did hear a gleam on good news which was that there were no signs of Leukemia in his spinal fluid or organs. However, we will still face an going treatment plan for the next 3.5 years until we are in the maintenance zone.This was an unexpected shock for our Family and something that we will have to cope with on a daily basis. However we have to try our best to deal with what has been presented to us, God doesn't give you anything that he doesn't think you can handle. In only the short amount of days we have found out this tragic news, we can not express to you how many heart broken nights of trying to make sense of all this, or count how many buckets of tears that we have shed. We are done asking “why” or “how” we are now determined and focused on “when”. “When” he beats this and ""When” he will look back and know that he made it through this. On that note, we want to make sure Landon does not go with out and to do whatever we can make sure this never comes back. This means on going medical bills, medications, time off work, or any other essentials that our Family may need to help Landon. Our insurance indicates that we will have to pay $10,000 for our out of pocket maximum annually which I am sure we met on our first night of 10 days at the hospital. (one of many trips to come, I am sure). Although we are prepared to face this we also know there will be many unknowns and more battles than there are victories. Landon is also not the only kid having to battle this disease and our goal is not to just fight for Landon but to also raise awareness and give whatever we can to also help others just like him. We truly believe that there was a reason that this happened and it’s god’s will to use Landon as a vehicle to create a community for families just like ours and to put a smile on every kids face as they battle this disease. We would like to thank all of our family, friends, co-workers, and strangers that have showed us such tremendous love and support through this entire process. It would be an understatement if we said that we were surprised by the amount of love that has been shown for Landon and for our family. Thank everyone for there prayers and whatever act kindness that can be done for our sweet boy. We expect to do another bone marrow test at the end of our first 29 day introduction phase to see what the next course of action may be.We will update everyone as we know more through our journey. #teamlandon",b8dc37c5b37ce4bc69441edb9d956e49,29,1.1536333333333333,720.0,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

He loves being at the beach and when he isn’t in school or working his part time job, he enjoys playing on intramural sports teams at school and hanging out with friends. In July, Kevin noticed some strange symptoms in his body. He had lip/jaw numbness, muscle pain in his arms and legs, heart palpitations, swollen lymph nodes and shortness of breath…. to name a few.He went to his primary care doctor, immediate care, an ENT, cardiologist, oral surgeon, and a neurosurgeon. No doctor could diagnose his symptoms. Each doctor had a different answer, and all seemed to think it was of little concern.Each sleepless night of worry and pain led him to continue in his pursuit for answers. As we prayed fervently for answers and healing, God stepped in right on time.Kevin would have been in Wilmington had the hurricane not evacuated his home and school. Thankfully, he was home on Monday, September 17, when he began hurting in his chest and was unable to catch his breath while lying on his right side. He and his parents went to the emergency room in Wilson to get help. FINALLY, a PA there found a mass near his lungs and noticed that his right lung was partially collapsed. He was immediately transferred to Wake Med. Many tests including a biopsy, CT scan, and extensive MRI were done. The results of these tests were alarming, and he was transferred to Chapel Hill to the NC Cancer Hospital. Based on a PET scan, bone marrow biopsy and lumbar puncture, he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).As you can imagine, for any 20-year-old and his family, the news seemed unreal and devastating. He’s not suppose to have cancer, he’s suppose to be planning and preparing for the rest of his life--NOT fighting for it. Kevin began chemotherapy on Saturday September 26, his first round of many. He’ll be in the hospital for the next 4 weeks undergoing grueling treatments, as they aggressively try to cure him of this disease.

I first met Sharon through our former pastor while Johnny was towards the end of his 1st battle with Leukemia. Sharon and I became  fast friends and since then, I have grown extremely close to the entire family.   I have written the story below as I have experienced this long journey to cure Johnny alongside the Van Kemp's. By starting this GoFundMe campaign...it is just one of the many ways that I can help my friends by donating myself and asking those with giving hearts to donate as well.  Please consider donating as you read Johnny's journey. Johnny’s cancer is back” are the words that  I truly did not expect to hear only just six months after Johnny completed his second fight for his life to beat ALL - Type B Leukemia.                                           Johnny was first diagnosed with leukemia in April of 2012. He ended treatment after  3+ years in June of 2015 and fought with such determination and faith. The Ironman of Summerfield knocked out Leukemia! Johnny’s parents, Sharon & John, could breath again. They all enjoyed 10 months of “normal life” before their lives came crashing down on them once again. In April of 2016 they received news that the cancer had relapsed and Johnny was thrown back into the fight for his life. After two years of harsh treatments, Johnny showed all who know him what a strong & faithful young man he was. By May of 2018, the Ironman of Summerfield's record was now 2-0 against his tough opponent & the Van Kemp’s were on top of the world. John & Sharon planned a summer of fun for Johnny who had spent the better of six years  in and out of Brenner’s Children Hospital. They wanted Johnny to enjoy every minute he could before he became a High School freshman in the fall and they succeeded - big time.  Refreshed and renewed - Johnny became a proud Northern High School NightHawk.  He completed the 1st portion of drivers training and enjoyed his first Homecoming.  Johnny became a ""young man"" before we knew it. His eyes were bright, his smile infectious, his faith even stronger.  Monthly check-ups are the norm for someone who completes cancer treatment...and appointment after appointment.  Johnny and his parents were told that his body was getting stronger and stronger.  During his 6th month check-up, October 23, 2018  - Johnny heard the news he never, ever, ever thought he would hear again. “The cancer is back.” Shock. Horror. Disbelief. Tears. Every emotion overtook Johnny and his parents. Their lives shattered in a million pieces...again. AGAIN! For the third time in Johnny’s short 14 years, they met devastation face to face. Pure devastation. From the outside, it may look to you like the VK’s have the best in life. Yet, if you were able to peek through a window of their life, you would see how broken beyond belief they are. John & Sharon have watched their only son, who began life on this earth fighting for his life as he was born pre-mature, endure once again intense harsh treatments - trying to kill the bad while not destroying all that is good inside of him. They have watched their son sit on the sidelines of life as others his age experienced the fullness of childhood & become teenagers. They have watched their son sit in the barbers chair to have his head shaved twice already and see Johnny’s self esteem fall on the floor along with locks of his hair. They have held Johnny’s head while sickness overcomes him and run to the “chemo closet” in their home to clean up the mess in the dead of night. They have seen their son look them in the eye and cry out to them - “I just want to survive” & “Save me.”  To say these past 6+ years have been magical - the farthest thing from it.  This new fight, his third, is going to be Johnny’s toughest yet. Your prayers along with words of hope & encouragement would be greatly appreciated as we walk along side Johnny.  Pray that God will give him the strength he will need to get through this next year(s)in order to reach the goal of healing. Pray that God will cradle Sharon & John with love and guide them as they make the best decisions for Johnny... as well as staying faithful as they endure the pain of witnessing their son fight through this battle once again.  As I mentioned, this is going to be the toughest of fights that Johnny & his parents have had to face. It is going to take all of their family, friends and community’s support to keep them lifted up.  The day he learned that his cancer had returned, October 23rd of this year (2018), he and his parents were told to go home immediately, pack some things and return to be admitted to the hospital. They were told that he would have to remain in the hospital for the next 26 days in which Johnny would receive his 3rd chest port in order to begin harsh chemotherapy. Johnny completed those 26 days but not easily. He experienced the expected side effects along with losing over 20 pounds, became extremely weak and frail, and lost a good amount of his hair. He contracted some type of infection in his sinus area which gave him extreme pain in the right side of his face. After many tests and medications, the infection subsided and non to soon. The day we brought him home, he could barely walk. Since he returned home he has begun to regain the weight he lost and is slowly building his strength. Of course his mother Sharon and father John are doing whatever they need to do to get him as strong as possible for the next phase of treatment. While in the hospital, the Van Kemp's learned that Johnny could be a candidate for  CAR - T Immunotherapy which would take place in Philadelphia. After many discussions and the meeting of certain requirements, Johnny was accepted at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).  Thank You God!!!  On December 3rd, Johnny and his parents will travel to CHOP for the beginning phases of this new type of treatment for Johnny.  The entire treatment period will be separated into two sections. The first, Johnny will need to be in Philly for almost a week to extract his T-Cells. The cells will be sent away to be ""harvested"" and will take about 4-8 weeks to do so in which Johnny will continue with maintenance chemo at home while waiting to return back to CHOP for the actual treatment. Once back at CHOP, Johnny and his parents could possibly be required to stay there for 6-8weeks. As thankful as Johnny and his parents are for this amazing opportunity for a forever cure, the financial burden will be extreme. Hotel costs, meals, rental car, etc. will all be a factor during this process not to mention the stresses associated with the upcoming medical bills, the current medical bills still arriving from Johnny's 2nd battle with cancer. Your funds, so graciously donated to Johnny’s Leukemia Fund, will help ease this financial burden.   Showering them in love... especially in prayers and your funds, so graciously donated to Johnny's Leukemia Fund,  will help remove the added stress so that John & Sharon can focus soley on Johnny and winning this fight for his life.  If you would like to stay up-to-date on Johnny’s progress, you may join the “Prayers for Johnny Van Kemp” on Facebook or Johnny’s Caringbridge page at:   https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/johnnyvankemp. If you donate to Johnny’s Leukemia Fund on GoFundMe, you will receive regular updates directly as they are submitted.  Johnny’s Faith is strong and he knows God will see him through this.  In gratitude and love, Cathy SatchellFriend of Johnny, Sharon & John Van Kemp",443ad0b5bc9c1f21cb5f42a35dbf34bc,72,0.625,90.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

She immediately began treatment at Providence Hospital in Anchorage. Her parents are my brother Darryl and sister-in-law Laurie, and they have lived in Barrow, AK for 13 years. Darryl is the pastor of Calvary Bible Baptist Church and volunteers as coach, equipment and ice rink manager for the youth hockey team, the Barrow Blizzard. Laurie is the city's go-to cake decorator, day-care provider, and is always right beside Darryl helping with church ministries, hockey, and being a huge positive energy in the community. They homeschool their children Micah (16), Jeremiah (15) Joshua (13) and Bella. Bella has undergone treatment that included chemotherapy and steroids. The first chemo treatment had the goal of getting her white blood cell count to drop from 800,000 to 50,000. This happened so much faster than anticipated that the doctors were shocked and said they had never seen a child respond so quickly! But ever since we first heard Bella was sick we reached out for prayer, and received a huge outpouring of love and support in return as Bella was lifted up in prayer by so many of you. Bella and the family are now headed to OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland, Oregon for a bone marrow transplant, donated by her oldest brother Micah. They will stay about 3 months after the procedure so Bella can be watched closely for side effects from the transplant. Medicaid has covered the majority of medical expenses and they will be able to stay at a Ronald McDonald House in Portland, but there are many additional expenses that will occur in moving, feeding and caring for the entire family as well as little Bella. If you would consider donating any amount to help with the costs of travel, food, and the many other needs that will pop up throughout Bella's time in the hospital, it would be so greatly appreciated!

General Hospital twice a week over the next 5 weeks as part of her plan.    We are hopeful and optimistic that this trial treatment will kick her Leukemia back into remission.  From what I have been told, these drugs have a 30% success rate.  This number may not sound as high as we would like but we have all witnessed Missy tackle tougher statistics then this!  Right now we are looking to raise some additional funds to offer financial support to Missy and her family during treatment and recovery.  Once again, Missy will be facing added expenses and a prolonged loss of income.  The amount of support we were able to provide thorough this campaign last year was instrumental in relieving some of the extra stress in her life.  I can only hope this small gesture can provide the same level of relief this time around, so her family can focus on the emotional and physical support Missy needs as they face tough times ahead.  Any amount of help is greatly appreciated no matter how small.  We are also looking for volunteers that can assist with bringing Missy to her appointments at Mass General in Boston, and/or anyone that can stay with her three children while Jose brings her.  Most importantly, please continue to send Missy encouragement and positive energy!            I will update again as I get more information Original Message:Melissa Smith is a funny, kind-hearted and loyal friend/sister/daughter/mother.  If you know Missy you would have to agree that she has a true passion for making everyone around her laugh.  She has devoted her time to caring for others and is the first one to help a person in need.  Unfortunately we received some unimaginable news yesterday.  Missy has been diagnosed with a cancer of the blood and bone marrow called Acute Myeloid Leukemia.  She began Chemotherapy this morning and will have a bone marrow biopsy to determine the exact type, etc.     We don't know much at this point, but we do know that Missy has a long journey in front of her.  Many of you have asked how you can help through this difficult time.  We have set up this GoFundMe account to help her and her family while she undergoes treatment.  Your kind donations will provide support with the care of her three small children, unexpected medical bills and lost wages so that Missy can receive the best possible treatments without worrying about the financial burdens. The love and support behind Missy is very strong.   Continue to keep her in your thoughts and prayers.  Keep sending her your love and positive energy.  Thank you so much for your generous donations.  Each little bit helps.  Together we can help her beat this.  #MissyStrong!",07d3db71e39068c9122ea88239986aeb,31,0.528,1050.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

He turned 2 years old 9 days ago and today was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and it has spread throughout his entire body so he is now fighting for his life. Yesterday he had a bone marrow biopsy and a platelet transfusion. Today he was diagnosed and had an echocardiogram done to see if his heart is strong enough to withstand the intense chemo treatments that he will need. Tomorrow he is having a port placed and a lumbar puncture so they can inject chemo into his spinal column. He then has to start daily chemo into his port which is going to make him very ill and he will likely be unable to eat and need a feeding tube. He will be in the hospital for 9 months in a private room where the air is filtered to hopefully prevent him from catching any illnesses as the chemo destroys his immune system, leaving him unable to fight off any illnesses. That is a lot for a 2 year old to have to endure so he will need his parents at his bedside to help him recover. In addition to all of those things, he will be needing many more tests, blood transfusions, procedures, etc. His parents, Jake and April, will be out of work for that time to care for him and in addition to a very large hospital bill they still have all of their expenses at home, gas money, food, etc. I ask that you please not contact them directly at this time as this is an extremely difficult time for them and they are needing to spend all of their time with Miles.

My family and I’s life was recently turned upside down when we found out my nephew Logan, who is only 3 years old, was diagnosed with leukemia. It all started with an ER visit for a headache and stomach ache in the middle of the night. We were thinking Logan would be given medicine and be on his way home. If only it had been so simple. The doctors noticed bruises covering Logan’s legs and decided to do precautionary blood tests. The tests showed Logan’s blood was in bad shape. Never once did our family wake up thinking we would hear the awful words “Logan has leukemia” but unfortunately, that is our new reality. Hearing this news shattered our hearts in ways we could have never imagined. We were broken. Logan is the most kind hearted, easy going, lovable child I know and he is my life, as well as my family’s. All he needs is a mud puddle and his day is made. Unfortunately, the life he once knew of mud puddles, ATV riding, and monster truck jams will look more like hospital visits, chemo treatments, and not feeling well for at least the next few years. Logan is our new Iron Man because of the port they placed in his chest.

Our 13 month old babygirl was diagnosed with highrisk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. When Lauren was first diagnosed we spent 40 days in the hospital recieving multiple blood and platelet transfusions also recieving her first INTENSE round of chemotherapy. Little did we know know our journey. with cancer had just began, as Lauren had 2.5 years of chemotherapy ahead of her. Which includes 1 year of INTENSE chemotherapy. This is all still so new to us, as we are young parents just trying to start our lives. I am trying to raise money to help out with the extra costs we are now facing as we are no longer able to work while Lauren is on treatment. With Laurens immune system being suppressed, she is not able to be around many people who may be sick, even something as little as a runny nose. Extra costs are food while we are at the hospital, gas to and from the hospital for frequent and some unexpected appointments, some medications, pharmacy fees, even some bills. If you are able to help even a little bit , that would mean the world to us. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Even if you cant donate please just say a prayer for our babygirl to stay in remission! Thank you so much.   EDIT : On May 10th, 2017 our worlds crashed down on us for a second time.  We were told that Laurens leukemia had relapsed and lauren was now going to be going through 3 cycles of even more intense chemotherapy, radiation and would be heading to sick kids hospital in Toronto for a bone marrow transplant. We couldnt believe what we were hearing. Lauren had only been in remission for 22 months and was still on active chemotherapy.   Lauren is now admitted into hospital for the next 3 rounds of chemo (30 day cycles) as we need to get her cancer back into remission. After that we will be looking for a match for her bone marrow transplant.  Once we find one we will be off to toronto where lauren will have 4 days of full body radiation and then will undergo a bone marrow  transplant. Then we will be staying in toronto for minimum 6 months. EDIT AS OF OCTOBER 13th 2017: Right now we are in Toronto sick kids hospital as Lauren had a bone marrow transplant october 12th 2017. Lauren is in very strict isolation.  Our stay in Toronto is currently unknown, depends how Lauren does. It is still very early to tell! We now have extra costs with staying in Toronto.  Costs like the charges to stay at the ronald mcdonald house which is $15 a day. Costs for food , parking & transportation costs & medical supplies.  We still have a long road. UPDATE ; APRIL 11TH 2018On April 8th Laurens leukemia relapsed 5 months after her bone marrow transplant. . Laurens leukemia not only came back, but came back more aggresive this time... she now has a mass in her brain.  Laurens new treatment plan is CAR T therapy. Lauren was not eligable for the trial at sick kids in toronto. So our family will be heading to Philadelphia in the USA for CAR T therapy.  In the next couple weeks we will be heading to sick kids for harvesting of her T Cells and then off to Philadelphia for a consulation. About 4 weeks after that we will head back to Philadelphia where we will stay 6 weeks minimum. We have a lot of unexpected costs coming up. Flights, hotels, medications, passports, food, taxis, accomadations etc.... which alot of our costs are required upfront! Again, thank you so much for all your donations. thank you for taking the time to read this. & even if you cant donate, please keep Lauren in your prayers.

The Craven's will have many deductibles, and other medical expenses associated with Wyatt's care and treatment. 2.

Some funds will be used for fuel. 3. An RN will be required to visit Wyatt at home for lab draws, if he is allowed to return home for the few days each month between his rounds of chemo. Wyatt will require medical supplies for home care such as dressing changes, and line supplies. We appreciate all who are able to donate, but most importantly we’d appreciate your prayers on behalf of Wyatt, his parents and siblings.Thank you.

The Powers family will need all of our prayers and positive energy through this difficult time. As we all may know, this will be hard for Greg and Libby to work.

On Monday, February 5th, he went to the Emergency Room. He was given blood thinners to ensure the clot would break up and was sent home. Two days later, on February 7th, his leg had gotten worse. He returned to the ER. At that time they ordered blood tests to be ran and a CT to be done. It was at that time they discovered Mike had leukemia. He was transferred from Lafayette to Indianapolis for immediate care and a full work up to see what the next steps were. The following day Mike underwent a bone morrow biopsy and a PICC line was inserted. They began administering chemotherapy nearly immediately. After the biopsy results returned it was found that Mike has Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia- Type B. This is very aggressive form of cancer. In the first four days of hospitalization Mike endured NINE chemo therapy treatments. He is expected to remain in the hospital for at least a month. After he is released he will have to go back every month and remain in the hospital for a week. For those of you who don't know the Law's family...There are several of them. =) Mike and Melissa have been together since they were teenagers. They have six children ranging in ages 17 to 7. If you have ever been to a North Montgomery School Corporation sports function, choir concert or musical you have probably been able to see them. Melissa can often be found taking pictures on the sidelines or sitting in the front row of any performance. Mike is a devoted father who works hard for his family. He travels out of the state a majority of the time for work but still finds time to take the kids to school on the first day every year, help lead Boys Scouts when his boys were involved and attend their school events. Currently Melissa is driving down to Indianapolis every morning after she drops the kids off at school. She then returns home every evening to finish homework with the kids, make sure they have made it to practices, and kiss them goodnight. Hopefully, by taking some of the financial burden off of them it will make things a little easier.

First of all, thank you for taking the time to read her story.  Kara has been fighting Leukemia for over 2 years and currently in remission. We just found out September 19th, that she has GVHD in her lungs. This has to be treated  because this can be mild, moderate, severe, or even life threatening. She's had a chronic cough for 3 months, trouble breathing and she is only 37 years old on oxygen 24/7 along with other medications. Her insurance company denied a prescription after the doctor tried to appeal it 2 times. Her only option is to fly out to Washington D.C. in mid October to enroll in a clinical study and start a trial medication that is similar to the one originally recommended. Due to the importance and severity of her health, I am sharing her story in hopes to help with all of the unknown expenses to make this happen because this was a last minute plan of action ordered by her Oncologist. I would love for Kara to be able to go and get the medical treatment that she needs so she can enjoy life again and be with her 2 children that need her. I met Kara Crawford in 8th grade, she says 7th! We have been best friends for 20+ years so I call her my sister. I remember when she came over to my house and told me she was moving to Newnan to be with Stevie, her current husband. For selfish reasons, I was devastated because we had so much fun together and we were together all the time, living the carefree days. GOOD TIMES! GREAT MEMORIES! She moved out of Gwinnett when she was 22 and started her new chapter in life. We spoke off and on throughout the years but LIFE gets busy, the years flew by, and we grew apart but spoke very sporadic.Kara is 37 years old and has been married to Stevie for about 15 years. They have two children who are so sweet, smart and super precious. Their daughter is Lexi who is 13, and their son Kevin who is 9. Kara is also a stepmom of three who are Steven, Brook, and Molly. She entered their lives when they were younger. She has always loved and cared for them just as much as her own. Beautiful family all together. Kara is one strong lady but her Faith in GOD has truly helped her stay strong and focused on the having positive thoughts. On March 26, 2014, I got a call from Kara with the most unexpected news that was not the news anyone would want to hear. She was very calm but she said,  I have Cancer...Leukemia which is Acute Myelogneous Leukemia. It is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow with excess immature white blood cells. I think I was in shock when I found out, I never expected to hear anything like that. My first thought was I would not wish this on anyone but I certainly didn't wish it on ""Carebear."" I drove to Emory University Hospital that day to see her. She started Chemotherapy right away along with a trial chemo medication. She was started on new medications that would help with prevention of any infection because of her immune system. She was so strong every single day. She's always smiling, maintaining a positive mindset, and she has truly been a fighter. Around flu season of 2014, she did stay at Emory for a period of time to avoid any risks of infection during treatment. I would come down for days and we would have slumber parties in her room there and we reminised on our past, talked for hours sharing stories about our cheerleading days, spring break trips, old boyfriends, shopping every Saturday for a new outfit for Saturday night, our club scene night and so much more. GOOD TIMES!!!Kara had her first relapse in January, 2015. She went through the process of  getting set up her first stem cell transplant. This was done on April 21, 2015. Her sister Amy was her donor. It was such a blessing that Amy was a match and was able to go through the process to help her little sis out in such a HUGE way. They both did great after the procedure. Later in the year, Kara had another setback in September, 2015. She started chemo treatments again from Sept-Jan. She was back in remission on January 4th, 2016 which was on her brother and maternal grandfathers birthday. She just kept going strong. She had a second mini transplant (little boost of her sisters cells) known as DLI in Febuary, 2016. Kara has had some side effects to the chemotherapy, medications, and infusions. If you saw her, you would not know that she has been fighting Leukemia for over two years because she is going at 110 mph every day UNLESS she was in the hospital. She wakes up early every morning and has her routine. She gets her two children ready for school, packs their lunches, drives them to school, does the shopping, laundry, cooking, helps with homework, brings them to their sporting events, church, birthday parties etc. She takes care of the household while Stevie is at work. She has tackled all of that and so much more while going to her doctor appointments and trying to stay well. It is absolutely ADMIRABLE and UNBELIEVABLE how much she does daily, considering what this illness and the treatments can do to the human body. She is an amazing mom and wife. Luckily her mom, Cathy has been able to fill in when Kara has been in the hospital for long periods of time, to help Stevie out at home.Kara has had GVHD known as Graft-versus-host disease which is commonly associated with bone marrow and stem cell transplants. It started off on her skin in random areas of the body. This past spring/summer, she thought she had conjuntivitis or allergies because her eyes were irritated and her vision was getting worse that she basically could not see. She did see an Opthlamologist and found out it was the GVHD in her eyes and there was a problem with the cornea and had tubes put in her eyes. She was told she would never be able to see again at 100 % without a particular type of contacts. She was referred out, saw a specialist that had the contacts for this condition that will help her see at 20/20 vision again. The contacts costs around $3,000.00 and her insurance denied it. Luckily the office had supporting documents and was able to get the contacts approved and she will be getting those on Friday. Dr. Khoury is her oncologist and he is just phenomincal. He was recently out of the country for about three months and has returned to the states a few weeks ago. She was seeing a different doctor while he was out of the country.  About three months ago, Kara got sick and was diagnosed with Parainfluenza. Since then, she has been on contineuos antibiotics, steroids, inhalers etc. She was not getting better at all. On Sunday evening, September 11th, she went to the ER for the chronic cough x three months and was severely short of breath. She was then admitted for observation and was there for one week. They were treating her for possible Pneumonia or GVHD but did not have a clear diagnosis. They had her on oxygen around the clock and breathing treatments every four hours along with other maintanance medications and new ones. I visited with her a couple of days/nights. One day, the doctor doing rounds came in to check on her. Since they thought the GVHD was in her lungs, he had discussed a plan of trying her on a new medication. We found out that this drug was DEA approved but had not gone through the complete process with the agency, so her insurance company denied the medication. The doctor stated they tried to appeal it at least two times but they still denied the medication. She was released on Sunday, September 18th. She is still on Oxygen 24/7 and is unable to talk much less be active without getting short of breath and a cough that won't stop. With Dr. Khoury being back and seeing his patients, he was on board with Kara's recent findings and plan of action. He had viewed the last two CT scans and he said it was 100 % the GVHD in both lungs. Dr. Khory's office notified her of this on Monday, September 19th. We were at Emory while she was getting her five hour infusion. She saw him today for her follow up and he is referring her to Washington D.C. in mid October for her to be in a clinical trial study for a ""sister"" drug to the one that was originally recommended but denied. Kara is still on the oxygen all day and night along with numerous medications. She is not getting any better.  She is short of breath and has severe coughing with talking, laughing or just a few steps. I have spent a lot of time with her at her home this past week, trying to help out because I was able to and I wanted to. She is having to rest as much as possible. but they do want her to walk around some. She can not take care of her kids or things around the house because she is very sick. She is not supposed to leave her house unless it is for an appointment. I left her house last night and she was exhausted because she is not getting adaquate sleep because of the constant cough and having to take prescriptions at certain times along with the breathing treatments every four hours. Her chest hurts and her body is tired, that is not to mention the side effects to her body from the previous chemo treatments. This girl DOES NOT complain about anything such as pain, side effects from the chemo, infections, or the fact that she has been sick for three months straight and has not got better. She just kept being the great MOM that she is until this last visit in the hospital. I can only imagine how difficult all of this is, the every day stressors, not only feeling good, but it is hard for her for her kids to see her like this.  She has got to out to Washington D.C. in hopes that this trial will be successful. I would love more than anything in this world for anyone out there to just send positive vibes, prayers if you believe, and if you can donate anything to this family in need. This would help tremendously with her expenses for travel, lodging, and food while out there. The study is done in two week cycles up to 8, including follow up visits every six months up to two years. This donation is so important because of the unknown and her being out of state and her husband going when he can, this could help out with their regular bills, her insurance, necessities for her children and misc. I would love to see Kara back home sooner than later by the success of this trial drug working and Kara feeling at 100 % again. I don't want her to stress about anything and I want her to feel better so that she can enjoy her life again and be active with her family.  ***This seems to be the next and possibly only option to treat this. GVHD can be fatal to patients when it gets into the lungs and goes untreated.

Everyone that meets Ever loves her radiant smile, winning personality and non-convincing shyness. She's warm, funny, energetic and she's just beginning to explore her skills as a painter, and her role as a big sister.  On March 17th, 2018 Ever's life was changed forever, and our family's life was turned upside down as she was diagnosed with Leukemia (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-ALL). Needless to say we were utterly devistated upon hearing this diagnosis, but there was a bit of good news in the prognosis--ALL is curable. We now consider ourselves extremely fortunate, blessed, and luckly. We have something to hold onto. We have a hope. We have a (very) good chance to save our baby's life. That right, Ever can be cured and go on the live a close to normal life, but the ride will be long and extremely hard. Indeed, the road ahead is very difficult for Ever (and her family). She will face challenges that 3 year old children should never have face, including an infusion of chemotherapy for the next 26 months, high-frequency visits to the hospital, no exposure to large gatherings of people (public transportation, airplanes, movies, etc), a plethora of chemical cocktails and pills that would scare any sane person, a restricted diet, limited and/or no schooling, and most importantly limited access to friends, family and loved ones (to ensure she is not exposed to infectious diseases, viruses, and bacteria). Still, given the encouraging odds of her survival, we are holding our breaths, crossing our fingers and saying our prayers. That said, there is still a lot we just don't know? There are a lot of expenses that our family will incur that we will likely be unable to cover. We are investing a serious amount of time into understanding this disease, its associated costs, and the best tools for fighting it. Moreover, we are looking at ways to ensure Ever can remain a positive, creative and engaged as a toddler.  Honestly, we (Ever, Mom, Dad, and Shiloh) know its a lot, but we will get it done with the support of our friends, family and loved ones.  We want to thank you in advance for any generosity you can spare for this cause. We have outlined how funds will be used below and we will be upding this page and our facebook page over the next 2 years to keep everyone updated on Ever's progress.Again, we sincerely thank you for your time and generosity.

This extremely close and loving family have always found a way to get by. Unfortunately it's a heartbreaking reality that sometimes things don't go as planned. For the last few months Steve hasn't been feeling well. After a couple of weeks of feeling this way, Erica and Steve decided it would be best if they went to the Doctor to get Steve checked out. After a few tests, results pointed to what could  be Leukemia. Steve was admitted to BMH and underwent a bone biopsy, and more labs were drawn. The results confirmed our worst nightmare, and their young family has been thrown into complete and utter disarray.While Steve does have insurance, illnesses such as this tend to be alot more trying and expensive than just medical expenses. Because of an immune system that will be compromised, Steve's time with his son Nixon will be limited, atleast for the forseeable future. This wonderful family has a very tough time coming their way,  and we as a family feel that when they get any chance at normalcy that cancer tends to strip away,  they deserve to spend that time concentrated on healing, and quality time together; not worried about work, or expenses that this will surely bring. We are in strong need for as many people as we can get to pray on their behalf. We know that God has a plan, and he is listening. . .

The days that followed this devastating news have barely given his family the time to process the magnitude of what this diagnosis would mean for Easten and their lives. He immediately underwent a Spinal Tap, bone marrow tests and had a picc line inserted into his chest to deliver the chemotherapy. Jen and Peter dropped everything in their lives and moved full time into the hospital to care for Easten. The aggressive nature of this cancer was already becoming apparent as his organs began to visibly swell and a mass appeared on his neck. AML is a fast-growing cancer and needs to be treated quickly. Easten is currently receiving his care at Saint Justine hospital in Montreal. The doctor’s plan to treat his Leukemia begins with getting rid of the cancerous cells in his spinal fluid by injecting it with chemotherapy. Three negative tests will be required for this area to be considered cancer free. The second part will be to get rid of the leukemia in the blood by doing IV chemotherapy through his veins. Each cycle will entail two chemo treatments per day for 10 days straight. This whole process will hopefully take not more than 5-6 months. At the end of each month they will analyze his blood to see how many leukemia cells are left.As you can imagine, these next few months will be unimaginably difficult for Easten and his family. To help Easten fight this long battle, Jen & Peter need to be by his side and still have to care for their 21 month old son Ellis at the same time. This campaign was created on their behalf to help them get through this tragic time. The timing could not be worse for their family, as Peter was just beginning a new career in real-estate, which will now be on hold. Donations will help relieve the financial burdens of things like the cost of transportation, hospital residence & parking, help paying for their mortgage and much more. Anything that you can contribute to this amazing family will be immensely appreciated. Words cannot describe how thankful we are to those that have already shown so much support. We want to send a huge thanks and to let you know It is greatly appreciated!This news is heart-wrenching and devastating, but everyone is staying strong and giving Easten the strength to fight. Prayer, positive vibes, and  encouragement are greatly appreciated and also needed.

I spend most of my days in the hospital or stuck at home, as should a sixteen year old should be in school worrying about their grades, or at least be able to enjoy time with friends and family. My family has been doing everything for me, and I can’t appreciate them enough for what they do, they have tried to keep a smile on my face since the moment I was told I had cancer, but I really know they are suffering themselves as well. Every day I see my parents wake up at five in the morning to go work at their demanding jobs, and get home late, just enough time to give me my medication. I hate to have to see them get home from breaking their back all day to have to get home just to see their son in pain, and I try to hide my pain from them in effort to make their day a little better. They show me smiles but I know they shed Their tears behind my back. I love my family so much and I am just now realizing how much I should have been appreciating them, all my brothers and sister have supported me day and night through all the pain and I really thank those people who visited me through some of my toughest times and cheered me up. Everyday I see these children battling with cancer at the hospital, but never in my mind did I think I was going to end up in their shoes. Nobody deserves to have to go through So much deep pain, much less a child who has just started to live their life.

I was finally making my own money, I had just bought my truck, school was going to start up, and I was finally beginning to feel the independence of being a teenager  when all of a sudden it was all torn away from me. The independence and freedom that most teenagers have was taken from me in the blink of an eye, and i could do nothing about it. I thank god that I have so much support in my life from loved ones and I have no way of showing it to them. My wish is to help my parents through this point in our life because I know they are not only stressed about me, but also for putting food on the table and keeping the electricity and water running. I wish I could just get a job to help relieve some of their stress but i know I can’t. I never was the type of person to ask for help, nor never wanted to be, but if I could help what so ever, even if it is just enough to put a meal on the table, It would mean the world to me to be able to help my parents.

Emily and Jon met while in school at Appalachian State University and worked side-by-side on the student newspaper.Whether it was writing articles for the student newspaper or instructing an eager classroom, Emily has always poured her heart into the task at hand. This amazing work ethic and caring personality have been pillars for her fight against acute myeloid leukemia.Throughout the month of October 2015, Emily was feeling under the weather. She went to the doctors on three separate occasions before her husband took her to the emergency room on Nov. 6. The first diagnosis in early October was a cold, the second a sinus infection and the third visit the doctors suspected it was meningitis.This diagnosis was scary, but Emily and Jon were not shaken by it as they headed to the emergency room.While in the emergency room, the doctors took blood and ran tests to determine the cause of this month-long, cold-like disease. The doctor walked in and said, “The tests have returned, and it appears that you have leukemia.”The emergency room doctor really couldn’t answer any of the hundreds of questions that dominated their thoughts, but the doctor was confident the facility in Charlotte, N.C. would be able to help.After traveling to Charlotte via ambulance, the doctors began treating Emily immediately. They conducted a bone marrow biopsy and instructed Emily and Jon that they would know more about the disease soon.The very next day, Saturday, Nov. 7, 2015, the doctor informed Emily that she has acute myeloid leukemia. The medical staff began a 10-day chemotherapy treatment immediately.After 41 days in the hospital, Emily was able to go home for Christmas. The first round of chemotherapy resulted in a decrease of cancerous cells from 81 percent to 1.2 percent.Now, Emily is scheduled for a bone marrow transplant toward the end of January. The doctors said the transplant is a “very good chance for a cure.”Emily and Jon have never asked for anything, but the family wants to share this story and help raise funds for medical bills, food and travel necessary because of Emily’s treatment.Our hearts reach out to this young family, and we want to help them with the financial strain that has become a burden.

I am humbly asking for additional support by raising funds for the continuation of treatment.

In September of 2018, he got the wonderful news that his Leukemia was in remission! Praise the Lord for he is the great divine healer!  Since then, they have to travel every month into Fort Worth for lab work as the plan is to monitor his blood levels monthly to ensure it stays in remission. During his January 2019 lab work, his levels were beginning to come down some and he had to make several trips back in for rechecks. The doctor was concerned so a scheduled Bone Marrow test came last week. The results reflected his Leukemia has returned. We are all saddened by this news. We don’t understand but we know God is in control and we have to put our trust in HIM.  Psalms 46:10 Be Still and know that I am GOD!  This is their verse as most of you know. We have to stop and be still, listen to GOD and let him lead.  We want to move that mountain, but GOD wants us to climb it again. I’ve told my wonderful sister, we climbed it last year, now we’ll climb it again together!  We know that GOD is greater than any physician here on earth! Only GOD knows the plan for all our lives. He will begin Chemo pills and shots daily for 2 months straight, then we pray that puts it in remission for preparation of Bone Marrow transplant. There’s a long, hard road ahead with many trips into Fort Worth. We all know how expensive things can be. They travel into Fort Worth from Graham constantly.

He is currently undergoing chemotherapy and going through a lot of pain, which is really hard for his parents to watch. For Stojan to survive and win the battle of his life, he needs to have a bone marrow transplant surgery. This is something that's not done in Serbia, so he will have to go to Germany to have this surgery done. Happiness in the misfortune is that his younger brother is an adequate bone marrow donor. This little boy doesn't want his brother to die, he is constantly asking God not to take his brother away.  The cost of this surgery is about €300 000, way more than any family can bare. It is especially financially difficult for Stojan's family who  lost everything in the war in 1995, when they were exhiled from their native country and fled to Serbia as refugees.

Beau’s one-year old sister, Selah, will not be able to attend the frequent hospital visits, adding the need for childcare to Josh and Betsy’s logistical list. So many friends of the Larrabees have been asking what they can do to help.   While we can’t take away the heavy burden of what this disease is and will be adding to their lives, we can lighten the load of the day-to-day with our financial support.  An answer to our “we love you, how can we help?!?!” cries.  A tangible and direct way to offer our love and support of this amazing family.  Funding will help support:·   the extreme cost of treatment that is estimated to exceed their    insurance’s cap·   tutoring for Beaudin to remain at grade level while unable to attend    school consistently·   house cleaning services (to help maintain the nearly-sterile    environment Beau will need to stay strong, postured to fight)·   childcare for Selah during Beau’s ongoing chemotherapy treatments    & hospital visits·   toll road fees from Longmont to Aurora multiple times/week    (doctors explained how shocked most parents are at this amount) Let’s shower them with our love in the form of financial support, in hopes of making this journey a little more bearable.  Thank you a million times over for your prayers and loving presence during this difficult road.  Each is strongly felt and cherished by this grateful crew of Larrabees. If you aren’t yet receiving updates and would like to, please visit Beau’s Caringbridge site at  https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/beaudinlarrabee.  You can also follow Betsy’s blog (less medical speak, more heart speak) at  www.summerofsilence.com.￼",35673298a19f07fea109019a3e9758e5,24,0.18745,19.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

My daughter Kirsten was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia on Sept 14th.  We are currently at the UNC Hospital Oncology facility in Chapel Hill where Kirsten is undergoing treatment.


We do have great Insurance with Aetna, but there are many many costs outside of the medical costs that are acruing.  


The treatment is long term, and Kirsten will be in the hospital for 4 - 6 weeks and then ongoing trips until full remission.


Everyone has been really amazing in their support.  What we aren't sure of at this time, are the overall costs that insurance doesn't cover.


Some of these things are Kirstens bills - rent, utilities while she is unable to work, living expenses at the hospital and the big unknown - what does insurance not cover.


While we are doing well now, we would appreciate any small help that you could provide.  All of the money (100%) will go towards Kirstens recovery, deductibles, and things that insurance does not cover and then to help her once she completes her hospital stay with living expenses until she can get her life back to normal.

At the age of 21, Ali Jafri had the highest of ambitions and the brightest of futures ahead of him. A joy for his friends and family, and a strong man of faith, Ali Jafri was bound to elevate those around him...until that fateful night. A car crash left him in a severe coma with minimal brain activity. A few days later, he succumbed to diffuse organ failure and was laid to rest. He was survived by his doting mother and father, Syed Jafri and Samina Jafri, and his younger siblings, Hasan and Zainab, who had never known a world without him.As the long days passed, the Jafri family held strong and endured the storm bravely. Zainab, now a junior in high school, knew her Ali Bhai would want nothing more than to see his sister achieve her dreams and continue to be the ace student that she was. She continued to excel in her classes with eyes set on the best colleges in the nation, all the while placating her healing family. In early June, just a few months after Ali’s passing, Zainab contracted the flu, except this was a flu like she had never had before. It lasted for days. Weeks. Zainab did not think much of it and continued to work towards excelling at her rigorous coursework. Her parents, however, decided it would be best to take her to the doctor. A day before she saw the doctor, Zainab became a finalist in a prestigious scholarship for her future college education.At the doctor’s office, Zainab and her family were greeted with looks of concern. They were told that there were some serious abnormalities within the lab work and that they would need to go downtown for further check up. On an ambulance, Zainab was taken immediately to Texas Children’s Hospital.There, she was taken to a very specialized ward, a ward for patients with leukemia. Zainab’s lab abnormalities were concerning for leukemia.After a prolonged hospitalization that required lumbar punctures and bone marrow biopsies, Zainab was officially diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Thankfully, while being one of the forms of leukemia with the best long-term prognosis, it still carries a long treatment regimen and short-term complications. With the devastating events of November 2017, and now this long and arduous battle with cancer, the Jafri family has had no room to think about the rigors of normal life. There hasn’t been much time to leave the hospital, let alone go to work. Zainab has been out of school for the past year, putting her dreams on hold. However, being the fighter and optimist that she is, Zainab sees this experience as one that has given her strength and inspiration. She is now an aspiring oncologist.

She was recently diagnosed with AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) and needs your love and support. With your support and God's grace we will all get through this.A little background story:When Khloe started having pain we (my wife and I) initially thought that they were just your typical teething pains. As time went on (about a month and a half later) ... we started inquiring more about the pain and if it was normal to still have that LEVEL of pain for so long. We sought advice from her primary care physician who advised that we take her to a dentist to get their opinion. We saw two separate dental offices who advised that possibly the tooth was just a bit stubborn and to keep a close watch on it. One night, Khloe's temperature reached 102.7 and we took her to the emergency room to get checked out. It was determined there that she suffered from a UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) and we were prescribed antibiotics. A couple days went by and her symptoms were not improving so we decided to take her in to see her primary care physician. It was at this time that it was recommended that we admit her to the hospital. We still thought we were only dealing with a slight infection as they told us that the initial antibiotic was just not strong enough to treat the infection so they switched to a stronger antibiotic. After several test ... we finally received the news that we most dreaded ... Khloe was diagnosed with AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia). Our hearts dropped in disbelief as we immediately went into prayer. ""This CAN'T be right"" we declared as tears ran down both of our faces. The initial shock of this brought us down to our knees as we just could not understand WHY this was happening. A few days have past, and we are still holding up strong ... but are asking for your support with some of the expenses for our daughter Khloe. We love you and thank you all as we grow stronger during this time.And a side note for anyone else who is going through something ... no matter what you are going through or what you are faced with ... there is absolutely NOTHING that will happen to you today that both you and God cannot handle together.God can work INCREDIBLE GOOD out of unspeakable tragedies ... but that doesn't mean He orchestrates the tragedies.

On April 4th, 2018 my dad (Dennis Walsh) had routine blood work performed, which revealed startling results. After multiple other blood tests, a PET scan, and a bone marrow biopsy, it was revealed that Dennis had a rapid and aggressive form of leukemia known as Acute Myeloid Leukemia, or AML for short. During the interim of tests, he also contracted bilateral pneumonia due to his diminished white blood cell count. He met with the oncologist on April 11th, 2018 who immediately referred Dennis to a hospital 3 hours away at Duke University because they do not treat this specific form of cancer locally. He was advised to travel to Duke ""immediately"" and arrived the night of April 11th. Upon arrival, the first task was to combat the bilateral pneumonia, which took 5 days, prior to initiating a vigorous treatment of Chemotherapy to combat the leukemia.  His oncologist at Duke informed him without treatment, he would be lucky to make it 1 month. With that, Chemotherapy began on April 17, 2018, with all signs pointing to a recovery and remission at this point. Dennis is required to be treated in-patient for the next 30 days, for which his wife, Karin Walsh, is staying by his side through the entirety of. His four kids are helping physically, financially, and emotionally any and all ways they know how. The community support has been tremendous and has greatly helped Dennis keep his morale up. It was recently revealed that Dennis will not be able to work for the next 18-24 months at a minimum per his treating physician.A few years ago, both Dennis and Karin fell on financial hardship that nearly depleted their savings account.  Over the years they have began to replenish their account, however it is not where it needs to be during this hardship.Karin is staying in Durham for the length of inpatient stay with her husband Dennis, and is required to pay for local housing out of pocket. This does not include the bills that are currently piling up at the couples home town in Brunswick County. Dennis was also placed on uncompensated leave for the time being until he is fit and ready to return to work. Karin's current employment is not sufficient income to maintain all bills, and this is prior to receiving medical bills.My dad has been a supportive and prominent member of any area he has lived in. He has worked endless hours in order to support his family the best that he could. He has had hardships that he has overcome more frequently than anyone should ever have to. He has always been one to give, even if he has nothing to give.  Currently both Dennis and Karin are worried about finances when their sole focus should be on kicking leukemia's butt. And their children are trying to help alleviate their burden as much as possible, however we can not do it alone. We are asking for the support needed to help both Dennis and Karin through this hard time to reduce their financial stress.

A member of the National Honors Society, a premier soccer player, a talented artist and photographer, an outdoor enthusiast, and a devoted son and brother. His is a loving and gentle soul that shines through and touches everyone he meets. In April, Jack started experiencing some back pain. It was bothersome, but not enough to be alarming until Jack went away on a fishing trip with his dad. What should have been a weekend of sporting fun ended up being one of continuous discomfort and worsening pain. The pain was excruciating, much different from the usual muscle soreness that comes from participating in competitive sports and outdoor activities. By the end of the trip, Jack knew something was seriously wrong. When he returned home, he asked that his parents take him in to an orthopedic specialist who had treated him in the past. The doctor took some X-rays, which showed a wedge compression in the T12 vertebrae of his spine-a rather unusual finding for a healthy 17 year old boy. Blood tests were performed. Results came back normal to borderline normal. Physical therapy was recommended, along with a follow up bone scan at the end of May. ￼￼￼￼￼￼Jack continued with his life, while his parents counted down the days until May 31st. This was the date for the bone scan, a day they hoped would deliver an answer that would bring an end to the nagging pain Jack was experiencing on a daily basis. Unfortunately, that day delivered more pain, although not of the physical variety. More fractures had developed in Jacks spine, and the scan showed yet another worrisome development, a thinning of the bones in his arms. New blood tests were performed. Bone marrow was extracted. On June 2, a diagnosis was confirmed. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.Jack, in typical Jack fashion, tackled his diagnosis like everything else in his life. First and foremost, was his concern for his family, and how this would affect them. Then he drew upon his strength. His determination. His humor. And he prepared himself for the fight of his life. He will need to hold on to all of those attributes in the long days ahead. Jacks journey on the road to eradicate his cancer has just begun. He has completed the first round of chemotherapy, but that is just a tiny step in the long, painful road to recovery. He will be traveling this highway from hell for at least 3 years. Your generosity will help Jack and his family with his medical costs and other care not covered by insurance, such as transportation to and from the hospital for treatments as well as helping Jack stay as comfortable as possible during this long and difficult journey back to health. Immediate needs are a new mattress with better support for his back. Donations may also be used for unforeseen costs including but not limited to lost wages by the family if and when the demands of caring for Jack make it necessary for one or both parents to take a leave of absence from their jobs.

This round of chemo is in preparation for clinical trials that will combine an umbilical cord-blood transplant (provided by a matched umbilical cord-blood donor) and a subsequent half match transplant donation from Ellen's courageous and generous brother Richie, who matches 7 out of 12 markers. The hope would be to put Ellen in remission so she can enjoy another 15 to 20 years of life. Ellen's resolve is truly awe inspiring. We humbly thank you all for your continued prayers, support and generosity. In December 2014, shortly after her 50th birthday, Ellen Canderozzi was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia. After fighting through three debilitating rounds of chemotherapy, Ellen was ready to receive a bone marrow transplant, however, none of her three siblings were a match for her. So a worldwide search for a bone marrow donor was underway. Luckily, an anonymous and selfless man was a perfect match. Ellen underwent a successful bone marrow transplant on March 18, 2015. After six long months in the hospital, Ellen was released in June 2015 and began to continue her recovery at home. Her prognosis was very good and celebrated her re-birthday on the one year anniversary of her bone marrow transplant in March 2015. Ellen had now reached remission and would just need to do weekly, bi –weekly and monthly follow up visits.In November 2016, during her monthly follow up visit, Ellen received the devastating news that she had relapsed. The Acute Myeloid Leukemia had returned. This came as a shock since her checkup 3 weeks earlier revealed no signs or symptoms of cancer.Ellen has once again began a series of intense chemotherapy treatments to treat her Leukemia. Ellen will also be in need of another bone marrow transplant in the near future. Despite continued support from her family, Ellen’s financial obligations have significantly increased with her relapse. Travel expenses to and from New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York City, along with expensive medical and prescription co-payments, and average costs for food and other household bills have become a significant financial burden for Ellen.Ellen presently requires all of her strength to fight this horrible disease for the second time in less than two years.",f8a524318b464bcaae5aa935792d5f27,18,0.5529,720.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

She has always been well behaved, full of energy, happy, and friendly. She brought so much joy to her family. Vikul has been a little ball of energy since she was a little girl. In May 2016, Vikul started complaining of striking pains in her legs. Our little ball of energy died down as she was constantly weak and tired. Tests were run on Vikul, where she was diagnosed with childrens Leukemia. Vika was immediately admited to the hospital to recieve treatments, and chemotherapy right away as her cancer was aggresive.Currently, Vika is being treated at R. Yolyan Cancer Center, and her condition is worsening. Her only single mother is at Vika's bedside day in and day out subsequently, has unfortunataly left her job to stay and care for her daughter and is now in need of our financial help and support. She needs our financial donations, in order to recieve the best care, medicines and chemo.  The road to recovery will be very long and strenuous, as Vikul will need continuous and extensive care in the months and years to come. A donation in ANY amount will help support Vika's treatment and recovery by covering medical and living expenses. Please help Vikul a chance at a long and healthy life, and give her the hope she needs to gain that fireball personality yet again.

This tiny lady, ""Frankie"", who is not yet big enough to fill out her name, was brought into Urgent Care for cold-like symptoms on Sunday, November 12th. Instead of being sent home with an antibiotic to treat her small cold, Natalie and Frankie were rushed by ambulance to Golisano Children's Hospital, where Baby Frankie was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia  - just four days shy of her 2 Month Birthday.  What does that mean? AML is an aggressive form of cancer that replaces normal bone marrow with leukemic cells - you can learn more from an AML survivor here. The long and the short of it is that this sweet girl will go through more before her 1st Birthday than most do in a lifetime.  What does treatment look like?Over the next four-plus months, Frankie's immediate treatment plan will include a minimum of 7 rounds of chemotherapy to fight the existing cancer, along with extensive care and monitoring of her immune system. Depending on how her body responds to chemo, she may then be in need of a bone marrow transplant. Because she's such a wee little thing and her immune system is so weak, she'll be a permanent resident of Golisano Children's Hospital, to keep her as far from germs and infection as possible. Mom and Dad will be working to find a balance between keeping her big siblings' schedules as normal as possible, while making the 45 minute drive between the hospital and home. She's so little, how's she doing?She is already proving to be extremely strong-willed (she's got the mean-mug toward nurses administering her meds down pat), but she has a lot of fighting left to do. She continues to surprise her doctors with how well she is responding to treatment, and she's quickly stolen the hearts of everyone on the cancer wing (no surprise there, just look at her). The road to remission will be long , but her family is choosing to live every day in love and hope. How can you help?Frankie's family is asking your help to cover the enormous costs of her medical treatment, term of residency at Golisano Children's Hospital, and the sacrifices that Mom and Dad will make for her care and to keep her brother, Jackson, and sister, Brie's lives as normal as possible. Because Natalie will be full-time with Miss Frankie, their family income will effectively be cut in half.  We're asking your help to ease the financial burden that Frankie's diagnosis has and will continue to put on the family, so they can focus on loving their little girl through treatment. The best way you can help is in thoughts, prayers, and monetary donation to Frankie's GoFundMe. She is small, but with your help, we know her fight and triumph will be mighty. Team Frankie!I will be updating this page as Frankie progresses through treatment. Thank you for your generosity, love, and support! #FrankieisaFighter #SmallbutMighty #FrankieStrong #FrankTheTank",3d3315ab8ebca663a903033979f249e7,21,0.233528,450.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

At first the news came like a punch to the stomach, but there is a bright side, it’s not a death sentence. The type of leukemia she has is one of the most common types, and it’s treatable with over a 90% success rate. Over the next two years she will be treated with chemotherapy, and the doctor is very confident that she will make a full recovery. Even though the doctors are confident that the treatment will be successful, it’s going to be hard on her, and she’s not quite three years old yet. It’s going to be hard for our entire family, so we would appreciate your prayers and positive thoughts for our small family and especially for Rivkah Avigayil bat Ahavah. Feel free to add her to any prayer lists you feel appropriate, and I’d like to ask you to give something to charity in her name, even if it’s just a dollar. HaShem has given the doctors the knowledge to know what’s wrong and how to treat it, so we are already part of the way there. Unfortunately, the chemo will have the same side effects for her that it does for everyone else, nausea, vomiting, hair falling out, etc. This is an incredibly difficult road ahead of us, especially for Rivkah, but we caught it early enough to beat it and we know that the Great Doctor is ultimately the One treating her. As I’m sure that you can imagine, this isn’t easy emotionally or financially for us, so if you’d like to help us shoulder the burden that would be great appreciated. Also, I’d like to ask you to share this post to reach more people who may be interested in helping, every share and every dollar helps.",fdedc0829364a12e4665d05e8ed16fb4,12,0.264,11.0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Their sweet 15-month-old Lola was diagnosed with AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia)The back-story: Lola had been sick for the previous 4-5 weeks. Her parents had taken her to the Dr. and the ER a number of times. Lola was treated for bronchitis and an upper respiratory virus but she didn’t improve after antibiotics. On 01/01/18,when Lola was so sick she was not able to sit up, she was rushed to the hospital as she went into respiratory distress. Upon arriving at the ER she was surrounded by a number of determined OHSU staff. After hours of testing her parents learned that Lola's blood count was extremely low, she tested positive for influenza, and she was still suffering from bronchiolitis. Lola had lost all of her color, and all of her energy. It was here that the doctors brought up the likelihood of Leukemia. Baby Lola was immediately admitted Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland Oregon.Fast Forward: In the past week Lola has been recovering from the flu and from bronchitis, has had a bone marrow biopsy, several spinal taps, blood transfusions throughout and she is receiving chemo twice a day.Baby Lola is a fighter and her little body is responding well to the chemo. She is out of bed for the first time and she is enjoying toys and books and offering smiles to anyone that doesn’t look like they are medical personnel. I watched her squeeze her eyes shut when a “masked” nurse approached, peeking only to see if she had gone away. This young family has made sacrifices and worked hard to recently fulfill some big dreams. Sabrina studied and trained to earn a great job in law enforcement. Michael was the primary parent for baby Lola and big brother Lando (almost 4) while Sabrina was away training. They recently purchased their first home. Life was treating them well. A new normal begins. Lola will continue to stay at the hospital for a month receiving chemo. Depending on how her body reacts, she will begin another round of chemo. Both parents have been staying with her around the clock. Doctors have told Sabrina to plan on a year of Family Medical Leave (FMLA) coverage at the minimum.Sabrina has paid family leave for 1-2 months, with some flexibility if needed. Sabrina has insurance. Michael does not. Michael does not have paid leave and he had to return to work today. He will inevitably have to miss work intermittently or for extended periods depending on Lola’s condition.Sabrina and Michael are independent, tough people and they would prefer to handle things on their own. However, they are a two-income family and they have already realized that they can’t get through this on their own financially or emotionally. This is what they are facing:·      Continued chemo for Lola either in the hospital or as an outpatient. Unknown at this time, depending on Lola’s response to chemo.·      Possible bone marrow transplant in the future, again unknown but this would mean an extended hospital stay.·      Treatment for years.·      Prescription medications that will eventually be their responsibility financially.·      Many, many trips to and from Doernbecher.·      Loss of income.·      A new day-to-day routine for Big Brother Lando.·      So many unknowns.How you can help and why:I am starting this campaign for my niece’s family so that they can have one less thing to worry about and focus all of their attention on healing sweet baby Lola while supporting big brother Lando. It is bound to be an overwhelming time for him as well. He is such a sweet big brother and I love him and baby Lola so dearly. Those of you who know me, know that I would trade places with that baby in a second and if I were wealthy I’d write a big fat check to cover everything and more. I can’t do either of those things but what I can do is reach out to you and ask you to donate to this family. If you are not able to donate, your prayers, wishes and good energy would be appreciated.  It would mean the world to me and I know it would mean the world to them.",fd482e65f16fcdfb6a0796b9ea332ef7,35,0.49758,390.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Needless to say this was shocking, life changing news for John and Meghan. In addition to it being very rare for a 28 year old to be diagnosed with AML, he also has a particularly difficult sub-type to treat. His AML has been resistant to all treatment thus far and will ultimately require a bone marrow transplant once he is in remission. John has undergone 2 rounds of chemotherapy at Inova which failed. In April John and Meghan picked up from their home in Virginia to move up to NJ so John could continue treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK). At MSK he has now undergone two more rounds of high intensity chemo therapy inclusive of a clinical trial, which have both failed. During this time, the chemo treatment and 4 months of being in the hospital took it's toll on John and he underwent surgery to deal with complications. As of June, John will now be entering his fifth round of treatment and next steps are becoming more uncertain and they are going ""off script"" to fight the cancer. The ultimate goal is to get him to remission so he can receive a bone marrow transplant which is a year long process of chemo, radiation, transplant, and recovery. But John is more than this, he is a husband, dog parent, son, brother, and friend. He is a strong, positive, silly, light-hearted, stubborn guy who refuses to give up and continues to fight like hell. John is a pre-clinical researcher at MedStar Washington who just wants to get back to his daily commute and have some normalcy. He is a hockey playing, sports enthusiast who can put together a mean fantasy line up. He has remained a steady force to be wreckened with and has never let his faith in his doctors or himself waiver. John's wife and partner in crime Meghan, has been by his side every step of the way. Besides being his caregiver and advocate, her other job is at Vibrent Health where she is a Program Manager working directly on programs for cancer survivorship and precision medicine because she has always envisioned a future where no person or family should ever deal with cancer or the burden of a life-changing disease. To literally be in the same shoes as the patients she works with every day and their families has given her more drive and purpose than ever imaginable and she continues to fight like hell. At this point John and Meghan have been fortunate enough that their insurance has covered a majority of medical costs. And what costs have not been covered and additional burden they have been able to cover with some sacrifices. However, with each treatment failure the next steps become more uncertain, they also become more financially burdensome. Just to give you an example of what they are up against the drug he needs next is $13,000 a cycle (1 month) and they do not know how long he will be on it, it could be months. The cost coverage was denied by their insurance. They did however, receive coverage from the pharmaceutical company for this first round, but again there could be potentially more to come. Also, bone marrow transplants are not typically fully covered by insurance and costs can upwards of $900,000. With unpredictability comes unpredictable costs.Meghan and John want to thank everyone for their generosity and thoughtfulness that you all have shown. I know they are hesitant to ask for help but with John out of work indefinitely, uncertainty of future treatments, current bills, and specifically paying the out of pocket costs for the uncovered treatment and transplant we are hoping to raise funds to support them so they do not have to stress about financials and can solely focus on getting John healthy. Core to who they are, their promise is to ensure any funds not used to support John's treatment, transplant, and care will be directly donated to support other young adults battling cancer.Thank you for your support and generosity,Kirsten (Meghan's sister)If you would like to continue to follow John's story, follow his Caring Bridge site:  https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/johnbauman18",2263ea8c2470e9efc12524c06d075770,28,1.2762857142857142,600.0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

This past November, he became very fatigued. He was low on energy and sleeping so often that his coworker advised him to go home and seek treatment with a doctor. It is because of this advice that Mark and his family soon gained full knowledge of this situation..After going to the Carle emergency room on the sixteenth of November, they were taken by ambulance from Champaign, Illinois to Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. Soon, he was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia or AML. It was then decided to start chemotherapy treatments. Two rounds of chemo later, the leukemia in his bone marrow was still at seventy perent. They then decided to take a more aggressive approach for the third round. It was then noted that Mark's blood count was becoming dangerously low since being admitted to the hospital. With a low blood count, you are at a high risk for infections and other complications. Mark was then believed to have tuberculosis, or TB, and was put into isolation. It was later found that he did not have TB but had pneumonia. Where They Are Now: Mark's devoted wife, Sheila, has been taking the near two hundred mile drive several times in order to try and work some at her in-home daycare and care for their two dogs. While Mark was in isolation, Sheila was not allowed to stay the night in his room. She had been doing this in order to save money, but in the end had to pay hotel expenses on top of everything else. The doctors then discussed the possibility of additional chemo to remove more of the leukemia present in his marrow in order to proceed treatment with a stem-cell transplant. It was found that Mark's leukemia had become so aggressive that a stem-cell transplat was no longer an option. Shortly after learning this information and considering his current health, Mark and his family had decided to return home. They have a hospital bed being delivered and till have home-care nurses for his two intravenous (IV) antibiotics. What They Need:Mark and his family's expenses are adding up at a rapid rate. Between medical, travel, hotel, and other day-to-day expenses are rising with less income coming in. On top of that, they have a ten thousand deductible to pay before insurance even begins to kick in. Please join us in prayer for this loving, wonderful family! No donation is too small.

Known as LAM for short, this disease is characterized by an abnormal growth of smooth muscle cells, especially in the lungs, lymphatic system and kidneys. Unregulated growth of these cells can lead to loss of lung function, accumulation of lymph rich-fluid in the chest and abdomen and growth of tumors in the kidneys. There are two forms of LAM, Sporadic LAM (S-LAM) and Tuberous Sclerosis LAM (TSC-LAM). S-LAM occurs for unknown reasons. LAM also can occur in women who have a rare disease called tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and Kaela also has TSC. TSC is a rare, multi-system genetic disease that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. It usually affects the central nervous system and results in a combination of symptoms including seizures, developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, and kidney disease.  Kaela’s issues with TSC were not that severe manifesting mostly with a skin abnormality and then internally watching lesions especially those on her kidneys.  Three years ago her lungs became compromised and she was diagnosed with TSC-LAM and has championed through 2 lung collapses and 2 lung surgeries to strengthen her lungs and all was going well until Wednesday.  She had a cold and wasn’t feeling too well and had noticed in the past week she was bruising a lot for no real reason.  The pulmonary specialist always does blood work and she showed him the bruising and when he saw her white blood count (WBC) was off the charts he immediately sent her to Loyola University Medical Center where she was diagnosed with AML and starts her chemotherapy treatments today.  She will be in the hospital for the next 4 weeks barring any complications and we are praying for a positive outcome.  She is a vibrant 28 year old who has a whole life ahead of her.  She is a wife to Matthew Aspeel, a daughter to Kathy and John Santillo, a sister to Kerin and Danielle, a granddaughter to Dorothy Wilson, a niece and goddaughter to Maryann Wilson, David LeBlanc and Rev. Edward Wilson, a niece to Tricia and Pat Meade and a cousin to Connor, Shannon and Keegan Meade, a cat “Mom” to Lucas and Jinora (aka Jinny) and a loyal friend and co-worker to so many and is loved by all!  She is an exceptional secondary education teacher and is looking forward to getting back to her students.  We are devastated but live in hope and prayer as she approaches this battle with the strength, courage  and attitude she already has had to muster for all her other health issues over the years.  This will be just one more obstacle that she WILL overcome.  She has a long road ahead of her due to the uncertainty with treatment protocols as a result of her other diseases but we are confident that her team of doctors will get her into remission with no signs of disease so she can get back to her full life.Kaela currently lives in Chicago as her husband recently finished his Master’s program at the University of Chicago and is now applying to PhD programs.  She is teacher at the University of Chicago Charter School and is the only income they have since Matthew was a full time student.  Their whole family lives in Rhode Island so family members will be flying back and forth to Chicago as work allows so Matthew is her constant source of strength and encouragement and for that we are thankful.We are asking for donations with no amount too small because every little bit will help defray the costs for her medical and living expenses.  If you are not in the position to give then we ask for prayers to give her the strength to fight this cancer and of complete healing for Kaela.  With much gratitude and love,The Aspeel, Santillo, Wilson and Meade families",3ff63c96b3bce4c9eb663b809f74976c,27,0.3178,780.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

On July 24th, 2018, three year old Cole Bragg was diagnosed with B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). On this day, the lives of Kelly, Mike, Ella, Cole, and their families were flipped upside down and forever changed in one phone call. Upon receiving that call, Cole was rushed to McMaster University Medical Centre where he was admitted for an initial period of 14 days. This is where Cole’s journey to fight cancer began. Leukemia can be classified as Standard Risk, High Risk, and Very High Risk, with the length and intensity of treatment differing by category. When Cole was originally diagnosed, he was placed in the High Risk category. His initial care began with 29 days of induction treatment in hopes that this would cause him to go into remission. This type of treatment provides high doses of chemotherapy to make subsequent treatments more effective and help the patient go into remission. Unfortunately, at the end of his induction treatment, he was not in remission and was moved to the Very High Risk category. Cole also has a rare genetic mutation of his Leukemia cells, called a PH-like mutation (CRLF2). Because  it is harder to treat, remission is harder to achieve for some children, and treatment becomes longer and more intense. Cole will have intensive chemotherapy for the next 8 months where he will attend clinic for anywhere from 2-5 days per week. He will have scheduled admissions along the way, as well as unscheduled ones for fevers and infection. The doctors have told the family to prepare for many peaks and valleys throughout his journey. As with caring for any sick family member, the emotional and financial burdens are large. The goal of this Go Fund Me page is to help cover some of the many expenses which in turn will help alleviate financial stressors, allowing the family to focus on Cole and his health. Kelly has taken a leave of absence from work for a minimum of 1 year; she will receive only partial income from Employment Insurance for caring for a critically ill child (which will only cover up to 35 weeks in total). Depending on how Cole’s treatment schedule runs, this may need to be extended. Additional costs we hope to cover include: gas, medical supplies, medication and supplements, home schooling costs, lost wages, special dietary feeding costs and countless others. Cole will also be seeing a Naturopathic Oncologist to ensure a well-rounded treatment plan. His family is prepared to throw everything they have into his treatment to help him beat this. The total length of Cole’s treatment is expected to be just over 3 years. Intensive chemotherapy will continue for 8 months, followed by 2.5 years of maintenance therapy and oral chemotherapy, as well as monthly visits to the clinic for I.V. chemotherapy. We will all be with Cole through every step of the way. Cole is our ray of sunshine. We are in awe of the bravery and strength he has shown so far.  When we asked Cole what he wanted to be when he grew up, he responded with “I want to wear an Army uniform and be in the Army just like daddy” or “I’m going to be a Paw Patrol Pup so I can save the day”.  Well Cole, we’re all here for you so one day you can grow up strong and save the day. Thank you in advance to all of our friends and family for the support provided. Your support and generosity mean the world to us all, and will make a massive difference in the success of the next few years.",58a517d53d1f0d3bbc5382015cdbae90,32,1.085,120.0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I have resisted telling it because I don’t want to need help or seem weak, but I do need help and I am physically too weak to keep going for much longer. I don’t even like the word “sick” and I am not a victim. Ultimately I am grateful for all of the pain and illness I have had to live with because now I can look back and know that I am truly not afraid to die. I have lived a good life. I have been kind and I have tried to live every day in gratitude for all the gifts I have been given. I am afraid, however, to keep living in a body that is not nearly as strong as my spirit and to feel like I can no longer contribute to the world in a positive way. The day has come when I am asking for help so I can hopefully have the resources to heal and once again play the piano. My birth made medical history.  October 10th, 1978 at Thomas Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia.  My Mother developed a 13 pound tumor 7 months into her pregnancy that was crushing me and killing us both.  I suppose I came into this world stubborn and fighting to have survived that.  Much later, when I began having mysterious health issues, I would find out that my Mom had been exposed to agent orange while pregnant with me living in the woods in Oregon. It is believed this caused the tumor and some of my subsequent health issues.  When I was 16 I left for college to study music and psychology with a full scholarship.  I hoped to help people someday.  During my first break from College I was a passenger in a car accident where I sustained severe whiplash damage to my jaw, neck, and back as well as a head injury.  Apparently I should have been killed instantly.  I was told I would never play the piano or the clarinet again. I refused to believe these things and went on to finish my degree in music performance, graduating with top music performance honors. During this time however, I was in constant agonizing pain.  I was seeing doctors, physical therapists, massage therapists and whoever else I could. I was doing this alone. I had also lost my visual memory, most of my depth perception and had to relearn how to use my eyes to read music. I could only practice the piano for a few minutes at a time but I didn’t want to tell anyone the real truth. That I couldn’t feel anything because it was too hard to live in my body anymore and I was ashamed. My jaw was operated on twice while I was in school, with the surgeon saying it was “the worst case scenario” and I would likely never get much better.  The doctors turned out to be right about that and I had to give up the clarinet.  I learned during that time to live with pain.  I put my own needs and feelings somewhere far inside and pushed myself until my body literally gave out. Something drove me to continue though.  I think now, it was fear of seeming weak, of needing anyone.  I had to prove I could still be who I thought I was supposed to be. Invincible? Worthy? Lovable? I learned that people are not to be trusted and that they would push me and use my abilities until there was nothing left.  I didn’t know how to say no. I lost myself and my connection to music. I also refused to truly let anyone know how much I was suffering.After a break from playing due to pain and exhaustion I agreed to accompany the choirs in the Coos Bay Schools starting in 2007.   At first I was terrified walking into a classroom, but over time I learned ways to make the pain tolerable and truly came to love working with the students and watching them grow as musicians and people. I believe that the energy I received back from them and the joy of being involved with music again helped keep me alive. I worked there until 2 years ago when I was forced to resign due to my deteriorating health.  During all of these years after college I was without medical insurance and continued to try and heal my body.  I spent every dollar I had searching out new therapies, new doctors, and was then informed about the agent orange exposure and subsequent endocrine issues.  My first surgery on my abdomen was in 2005.  After years of searching, I was finally put on a treatment regimen that helped with the endometriosis and PCOS pain, but I had also been diagnosed years before with Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue, Chronic Pain, Severe TMJ and a Traumatic Brain Injury. I had never fully recovered from the car accident and was living in a body I didn’t trust.  My case was extremely complicated already and I was trying to live as best I could and appreciate each moment.  I spent as much time as possible outside, connecting to nature.  I still had this overwhelming drive to help make the world a little brighter.  To contribute, no matter the cost to myself.  I even went to massage school in Ashland and opened a practice in Bandon so that I could help other people in pain.  I felt like I had first hand knowledge of what it was like to be in pain and wanted to make some kind of difference in the lives of other people in a similar situation.  This further weakened me.  I eventually began having severe exhaustion, even more wide spread pain and gastrointestinal issues.  About 8 years ago I started being unable to eat almost anything and lost weight and rapidly declined in strength and vitality.  Today I weigh about 99 lbs. I’m 5’6”. Prior to this I could tell my body wasn’t functioning properly and had started seeking help.  I had test after test to determine an underlying cause with no real answers. I had no insurance and spent everything I had on medical treatments to improve my condition.  Due to pre-existing conditions I wasn’t able to get insurance until about 5 years ago when I committed to working full time for the school district. This still didn’t cover everything and the bills kept piling up.   In April of 2014 I had part of my small intestine removed and again with an emergency surgery in November of 2014.  The following April I had my gallbladder removed.  Last February, after multiple attempts at putting in a PICC line, using heparin locks and most of my veins being too scarred to use, I had surgery to put a port in my chest so I could receive IV fluids and nutrition. At this point I was not functioning. No one could explain what was going on.  I didn’t have an obvious diagnosis for the gastrointestinal issues.  I was put on disability and basically have been trying to maintain some quality of life since then.  The combination of the car accident, agent orange exposure, and all of the surgeries has taken its toll. I have spent tens of thousands of dollars trying to “get better”. Right now I owe about $8,000 on credit cards from medical bills and $18,000 of medical bills I paid off with a loan against my home.  I can’t make the payments anymore and the bills keep coming in.  I was automatically placed on Medicare because of my disability and just found out I will be losing most of my Medicaid which was paying most of what Medicare does not.  If this continues, I will lose everything. I think, even more than the pain and being nauseous, sick and weak all the time, I miss being able to contribute.  I still try to be strong and don’t often tell people these things, which leaves me isolated and alone.  The truth is I don’t know from one day to the next how I will feel. Will I be up sick all night and not be able to walk? Will my legs be cramping so badly that I can’t even drive to the park?  Do I need to go to the hospital? Again?  If I black out again will I wake up?  Do I need another imaging study? More radiation exposure?  More pain medication? Why can’t I just fix this myself? Why?  Am I too weak? Did I do something to deserve all of this? I need IV’s and help with the pain but I can’t afford it so I suffer in silence.  It’s ugly. Truly ugly.  Constant pain for 20 years changes a person.  All the time I’ve lost in all of the surgeries scares me. I don’t want to have to share this but it is the reality of my physical body. A reality I am having trouble facing. Now, I want to make a distinction.  During all of these years there have been various people who questioned how I was still alive.  I think there is something driving me still which I have to admit has kept me alive but has also kept me from asking for help before now.  I felt like I had to do it alone.  I can’t be weak.  I don’t want to be a burden or really tell people how terrible I feel.   I also feel like there is a deep, eternal part of me that is completely separate from all of this and that is the reason I am still here.  I see so much beauty in the world.  I smile at everyone even when I feel terrible, especially the people who don’t smile back.  I try to be a source of light and kindness in the world.  In every interaction, in everything I do, I try to radiate peace and light.  This is all I am physically capable of for now, but I believe it is actually a huge gift.  I am starting to truly believe that I can be loved and I didn’t deserve this stuff.  Yes, it happened to me, but I am grateful.  I am strong.  A weaker person would not have survived and I know that without a doubt I am meant to share music again with this world.  I am not a sad person and this is not a sad story.  Maybe I’m just so stubborn that it took all of this for me to see how amazing life actually is and that we are ultimately all fighting our own battles but we don’t have to do it alone.Last February, during a stay in the hospital, the surgeon discovered I have an extremely rare condition called celiac artery compression syndrome.  The surgery is risky but I have decided to have it done here in Ashland this Fall.  There is a chance it will not help at all and I will just be weaker coming out the other side.  There could be complications, but I feel like if there is even the slightest possibility I could eat a little more so I could be just a little bit physically stronger, it is worth it.  I don’t even remember what it’s like to be able to meet a friend for lunch or not have to worry if I’ll be able to get home if I go for a walk. After so much pain and so many years of being so sick, even the possibility of improvement is a gift.  I am hopeful that with treatment and once recovery from the next surgery is complete I will be able to regain some physical strength and get back to playing the piano again in some capacity. My spirit and mind are so much stronger than my body has become and I know it will take time, but I have to have hope that some day I will be able to contribute again. I have spent my life in service to others which is what I believe I am meant to do, and have loved doing, but I have never asked for help and have reached a point where I truly am in need of assistance.  I have medical bills from the past 16 years which I am trying to make payments on but with my current inability to work, the stress of making these payments is taking a serious toll on my health and well being and I am unable to seek out treatments I need such as vision therapy, medications, supplements, bodywork, physical therapy, IVs and counseling. I will also be responsible for paying part of the upcoming surgery bill. I am learning that asking for help is not a weakness but it is extremely difficult for me. I’ve been trying to write this for a few years now but felt like I needed to hide my weakness.I dearly hope the ultimate outcome of this is that given time, and rest, and probably a lot of help both financially and emotionally, l will be able to once again play the piano for the schools or at least teach lessons.  Music is a gift that is meant to be shared.  My goal each day that I was working in Coos Bay and with every performance we gave, was that the music would touch the hearts and lives of the students and the audiences.  It was an opportunity to share hope, joy, even sadness, and to genuinely offer these as gifts through music to the world.  I cannot think of any greater gift. Thank you for reading all of this. If you do not have financial resources to be able to contribute, I ask that you please try to appreciate the gifts you have.  Go outside, breathe, feel the wind, really taste your food, smile at people.  Especially the people who don’t smile back.  I have learned finally, through all of this apparent suffering and pain that truly we are all the same.  We are not alone. You are not alone.  I am not alone.",81b6fae2f16dbadfe1108bf9f4d5773b,141,0.92262,840.0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

The last thing he expected was that by 6am he would be admitted and moved to the cancer floor. After a quick diagnosis of a rare blood disease called Acute Monocytic Leukemia, Ryan was transported to UW Medical Center where he will receive some of the top cancer care in the nation. With an 85% solarity level of leukemia in his bone marrow, August 12th, 2018 will begin Day 1 of his highly intensive chemotherapy treatment regime to essentially wipe out his entire system. Ryan faces multiple rounds of chemotherapy, months of blood transfusions on an every-other-day basis, and potentially bone marrow transplant down the road. We are thankful that Ryan was offered a rare opportunity to participate in a clinical study, offering the attention of top notch doctors from around the country. This is going to be the fight of all fights- but we know Ryan has the strength to conquer it. 

￼
Ryan is a career Wildlife Specialist for the USDA and has worked for the WA/AK Program since 2014. Prior to that he worked as a technician for the NWRC in Montana. He is an avid sportsmen and when he isn't working, you can find him in the woods hunting, fishing on the bay, or raising poultry. His passion for wildlife and the outdoors has taken Ryan all over the country, where he has made friends from all walks. 

￼
For all of the wonderful people that are looking for a way to help ease the pain and burden of this nightmare for Ryan, we have created this gofundme account. While we have to say we are SO thankful for the outpouring of love and support from everyone, having in-person visitors is NOT the best thing for Ryan until further notice. Within a few days, Ryan will have virtually NO immune system and will be very susceptible to illness. We cannot run the risk of complications and ask that no one come to the hospital at this time. Ryan will be out of work for an indefinite amount of time and will reside at UWMC in Seattle for at least a month at minimum. As you can imagine, medical bills are only the tip of the iceberg. Ryan will also have ongoing personal bills and expenses, transportation costs, etc. Anything you can contribute to help alleviate that stress is so appreciated!

￼
Even if you cannot make a contribution, we ask that you please take a moment to SHARE this campaign, and PLEASE keep Ryan in your thoughts and prayers. He will need all our love and support while he kicks this things ass!! Thank you all from the bottom of our hearts! (Disclaimer: This campaign names Ryan's amazing aunt Linda Howard as the beneficiary as she will be helping Ryan coordinate and access the funds raised directly.)

If you have ever met Carson you would know how special he really is. He is a brilliant 7 year old boy who has always been bright for his age. He can be a little awnry at times, as can any kid his age, but he is the sweetest child I have ever met. He loves giving hugs and always finds a way to make you smile. He loves his family and God more than anything and lets everyone know how much he loves them. He can be really silly and will often sing little songs he comes up with. He loves the color green and Legos as well as Skylander's, Power Rangers, and other fun things but has plenty of gifts for Christmas. Carson and the rest of his family are OU fans so although the official color for Leukemia is orange, you can call us Team Green. What  Exactly  Does He Have?Although Cancer SUCKS, we are going to do our best to fight it. There are a lot of different types and even more subtypes below those. Initially we found out that Carson has Leukemia, a special type of cancer. If you want to learn more about what Leukemia is, this is a helpful video to understand it in simple terms: Leukemia (Link to a short TED-Talk).  On Monday, December 19th, we found out that Carson has a type of Leukemia called AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia). If you would like to learn more about it here is a useful website: AML.            How Did We Find Out?On Friday, December 16th, Carson was brought to the pediatrician after having had a low-grade fever and leg pain for about a week. We all had been feeling a little sick so we assumed it was just a bug going around or maybe the flu at worst. Since he wasn't feeling better yet we took him to the doctor just to be safe. We never expected this news. The routine bloodwork showed an extremely elevated White Blood Cell (WBC) Count of 129,000/mm3 compared to the normal range of 5,000-10,000/mm3. As soon as he saw the results, the doctor knew it was leukemia and told Kori and Will to take him immediately to OU Children's Hospital. Once there, more tests were done to confirm that he does in fact have Leukemia and he was admited to the Pediatric Oncology Unit here at The Children's Hospital.How Is He Doing Now?We will be posting updates to the GoFundMe page as well as to the Facebook Page, so for the most up to date information on how he is doing check those. As of Tuesday, December 20th, He is still feeling happy and isnt acting or looking sick. However, he started his chemotherapy at 8:00pm Monday, December 19th and will begin to feel progressively sicker as the chemo does its job. Although this will be a difficult process, it is necessary for him to get better.  Already his WBC Count is down from 129,000/mm3 to 51,000/mm3. Because of this treatment, his immune system will be shot so we ask that no one but family comes to visit for now and if anyone is feeling even a little sick to keep their distance for his safety. It is also important to not send flowers. They can harbor fungal spores that can place the patients at risk. Because of how aggressive AML can be and how badly it affects their immune system, Patients often stay in the hospital until treatment is over. This means if things go well he will get out in 6-7months but it could go even longer. How Can You Help?As you know staying in the hospital is very expensive, especially with a case like Carson's where he will be here for months. Insurance can only pay for so much. On top of this, Kori will need to take off work to stay here with him so he is never alone in a hospital and is always taken care of.  That means on top of their added expenses, their income will be effectively cut in half. The BEST way to help is to keep Carson in your thoughts and prayers and to donate to this campaign. All the money from this GoFundMe is set up to go straight to Kori and Will to help make sure they can worry about keeping Carson alive and healthy rather than worry about money. Carson has recieved plenty of donated toys and already has the ones from his family under the tree which we have moved to the hospital. Although it is Christmas time and everyone wants to donate toys, what matters most is making sure they can focus on his health and not bills.",a6c74810517da4f600efd4fc4497c210,39,0.66524,780.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

He started his first session of chemotherapy this week and will be receiving same procedure every week for the next 6-9 months depending on how his body responds. His treatments will continue monthly for the next 2 to 3 years.    This is a long and expensive medical journey but we have faith that Crizan will fight this battle with all his might.  He will have an amazing support team rooting for him the entire way.            Any financial donation you are able to make can help can help alleviate the pressuring expenses our family is facing. We will use it for medical bills, treatments and countless other unknown expenses this road will bring.  It will also allow Francis , Bernadette and Crizan’s brother Angelo to focus all of their energy on Crizan’s health care.          Please donate to support Crizan and share with your friends and family.

For the past severeal years she has been valiantly battling this affliction. During this time she has been unable to work. Imagine yourself being so ill you are simply unable to earn any money to offset the immense expense that comes with having your life upended by an unforseen medical condition and the ongoing treatment that comes with it. This has gone on for years now. She continues to fight. Nancy is an intelligent, kind, caring a very funny woman. I am her friend. I'm setting up this fundraiser to help her cope with this ordeal. I've already asked many people to donate via previous fundrasiers, but I am asking again because I believe it is up to us to help her.  The american social safety net is a farce and a disgrace to humanity itself. Everyone is well aware of the fiscal cruelty that is America's health insurance industry. Imagine yourself or a loved one having to deal with all of this in addition to the pain the illness itself brings. I don't know how Nancy does it, but she does. As does her mother Cheri.   This isn't someone asking for money to make a music video, or purchase studio time to record an album, or fund a vanity project masquearding as a cause. This is my friend's LIFE. Donations will be used to help offset the unavoidable and immense cost of her prolonged treatment. There's hundreds of items insurance will not cover and even with insurance everyone knows additional bills from the medical complex will find their to Nancy and Cheri, increasing the strain and pressure. Forcing their attention away from treatment and recovery. Her illness has put a great financial strain on her family as well. Her mother Cheri has been by her side this entire time. You think you are a good mom? Perhaps you are. Cheri is redefining what it means to be a GREAT mother. She has left her home and life behind to care for Nancy. In my imagination, I wish a person or persons with exhorbitant wealth would just appear and cut Nancy a giant check to put her and Cheri's mind at ease for the duration of her treatment and recovery, but I know this is unlikely to happen. We cannot wait for such a miarcle.It's up to us to raise these funds. Her friends. Our friends. The friends of our friends. Perhaps even strangers who don't even know Nancy and Cheri but are simply moved by their situation to create a kindness in a world that, these days, seems more unkind than ever.  Please help us raise this money for these two amazing human beings. Spread the word. Cajole your friends, colleagues, teammates, enemies, neighbors, family members etc. If it is one I've learned from doing the previous fundraiser for Nancy, it takes more than simply posting this to your Facebook page. It takes more than prayers and positive vibes. We have to WANT it. We have to WORK it. Work it people. Work it.  Thank you.Randy",d2017707e3df166a5322bee06db792af,42,0.63,840.0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Except for the fact that you’re three weeks away from giving birth to your second child, and your 17-month-old child has an eye infection that isn’t clearing up with antibiotics, everything else seemed like usual. 


But today July 20th, 2017 isn’t an ordinary day. It's the one year anniversary of your move from Australia to Ireland but that fact fades into insignificance in a few short hours.


Today, your sick child’s mood seems to change and all they want to do is endlessly sleep. They’re no longer eating and playing and the eye infection seems to have taken its toll.


You call around to the pharmacist and GP, thinking they’ll prescribe some stronger antibiotics, you’ll go home and ride out a few more days of nursing a sick child until they are back to normal health.


But the GP is not happy and instead of heading home, sends Clodagh straight to the local hospital.  This is where they runs some extra blood tests and the results come back erratic and inexplicable, and instead of heading home, you are rushed to the Our Lady's National Children’s Hospital in Crumlin, Dublin with your heart sunken.


You start to realise nothing is going to return to normality any time soon, as a nurse escorts you to a special room where the doctors , three nurses and a counsellor gather around you to share news that you never want to hear.


Your child doesn’t just have an eye infection… they have leukaemia (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia).


It’s a parents’ worst nightmare that could hit any of us at any moment in time.


And it happened to 17-month-old girl, Clodagh.


Within 18 hours of her diagnosis, Clodagh had her first operation and chemotherapy treatment, and has had many more chemotherapy sessions since then, with weekly lumber puncture operations and more chemo sessions to come.


In the next two weeks, Clodagh will lose her hair, become incredibly weak and the chemotherapy will destroy her ability to fight infection.


Clodagh and her family will spend the next two years of their lives in and out of hospitals working on a treatment plan. In the first 35 days, the treatment she receives will kill the leukaemia cells and the six months following will be spent making sure they don’t return. After that, Clodagh faces the long road of re-building her immune system.


As Clodagh currently has no immune system to fight anything, the minute she gets ill her parents must rush her to the hospital.


With another baby due any day, Clodagh’s mother Eimear will not be working and home caring for Clodagh and the new baby, and her father Cameron has had to give up work to help. With no wage, unknown and unforseen medical expenses and the need for an additional car to ensure they can rush Clodagh to hospital whenever needed, the family face a very long road ahead and they need our help.


Myself and the rest of Eimear's mothers group here in Australia, have put together a Go Fund Me Project to help the parents’ purchase a second car and put money toward any future medical costs to help alleviate any financial duress in this already stressful time.


This fund me account is totally controlled by Cameron and Eimear to help little Clodagh with all the medical expences she will need to help her fight ALL. The family will unfortunately have no income for the immediate furure with Cameron being Clodagh's full time carerand Eimear looking after the new addition, so every little bit will help.


We would like to thank you in advance for your love, thoughts and generosity!
Every little bit helps in giving little Clodagh the best chance at the full and happy life she deserves.

In January I had a follow up appointment with my hematologist, my blood work had dropped to a dangerous level and she ordered a bone marrow biopsy to see what was going on, well the sample was not a good one but pointed to AML Leukemia and she referred me back to Stanford Cancer Center to follow up. Two days after the first bone marrow biopsy my blood levels dropped even more and I needed two units of blood just to stay alive till I could get to Stanford Cancer Center. That was March 15, 2017. On March 16th another Bone marrow biopsy was done and confirmed it was indeed AML leukemia on March 17th. I was already admitted to the hospital and they started chemo at 11:15 pm March 17. So far so good, but I'm concerned about the bills I'll be getting in the future to pay for my 6 weeks or more in the hospital, I've got Social Security Medicare right now and don't qualify for Medical.

Anyone who has had the pleasure of meeting Emma has had their life forever changed by her kind heart and beautiful smile. It is with heavy hearts that we write this… Yesterday our sweet Emma was diagnosed with Leukemia. Over the last few days Emma has been in pain. Everything from fevers, joint pain to severe stomach pain. She went into Urgent Care who gave her a strep culture and sent her home. The next morning she woke up because of severe pain in her abdomen and went to the ER. Upon much more examination and testing she was told she had Leukemia. From the ER, she was loaded into an ambulance and transported to a Cancer Treatment Center down south to start treatment immediately. This morning Emma had her first bone marrow test to determine the type and severity of her Leukemia. Her current treatment plan will have her receiving treatment at the Cancer Treatment Center for the next 3 to 4 weeks. The funds raised through this page will help Emma and Eddie cover many of the unfortunate and unexpected expenses they encounter.

However, this all led to additional costs, amounting to $45,000 above what has originally been collected. We are grateful to the many that have already contributed, but are, once again, asking for help and generosity of those and others to help raise $45,000 needed for additional treatment that will cure Miljana. On behalf of Miljana, Vukasin, and Marko Stankovic, thank you for your continued help and support! Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers.Darko Stankovic, Vukasin's uncle.We are initiating this $45,000 campaign through GoFundMe platform, since YouCaring is integrating with GoFundMe and will not accept donations after May 2018 for PayPal accounts originating in Serbia.Nasa borba je pocela u martu prosle godine kada je Miljani Ristic, mladoj mami sedamnaestomesecnog Vukasina, dijagnostikovana akutna mijeloblastna leukemija, izuzetno agresivna i opasna vrsta raka kostane srzi. Zahvaljujuci sugradjanima, prijateljima i svim ljudima dobrog srca, koji su preko noci postali deo nase porodice, prikupljena su novcana sredstva za njeno lecenje u Hammersmith klinici u Londonu. Miljana je sve hemioterapije, kao i samu transplantaciju maticnih celija, podnela hrabro i uz osmeh, i sve je ukazivalo na potpuni oporavak. Nazalost, pre dva meseca njeno stanje se pogorsalo. Lekari su prvo otkrili infekciju na plucima i jetri, da bi ubrzo nakon toga konstatovali povratak bolesti. Posle ovog sokantnog saznanja Miljanina porodica je imala million pitanja za lekare, a Miljana samo jedno: “Kada se vracam kuci mom sinu?” Ova mlada hrabra zena je prosla kroz novi ciklus hemioterapija, i primila dve dodatne doze maticnih celija. Njeno zdravstveno stanje je trenutno stabilno, a lekari su optimisticni i veruju u najbolji moguci ishod lecenja nase Miljane. Medjutim, celokupna situacija dovela je do novih bolnickih troskova u iznosu od 45.000 $, sto prevazilazi prvobitno prikupljenu sumu novca.  Ovim putem vas jos jednom molimo da ponovimo proslogodisnje cudo i da svojim prilogom omogucimo Miljani dalje lecenje u Londonu, te da joj zajedno odgovorimo na pitanje: Uskoro se vracas kuci, tvoj Vule te ceka! Cuvajte Miljanu u svojim mislima i molitvama!Darko Stankovic Napominjemo da smo do sada koristili YouCaring platformu, ali smo prinudjeni da akciju preusmerimo na GoFundMe, buduci da ce sve novcane transakcije preko You Caring fondacije biti nedostupne za PayPall korisnike iz Srbije (od 1.juna 2018).",fa541da832569490a38d64a88d8b257d,19,0.40213333333333334,270.0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

He enjoys hanging out with his older brothers, playing with his toy tractors, and watching tractor trailers on youtube. And like every boy his age, he loves to play rough and occasionally gets the bruises to prove it.But things changed for the worse on July 18th 2018, when his parents Michael and Brandy started to realize that his bruises were not healing. So like any concerned parent, they decided to take Gage into urgent care as a precaution. We are VERY lucky they decided to take him when they did.After waiting to hear something on Gage’s blood results, the doctors were persistent upon receiving the results to do a chest x-ray immediately. What started out as a cautious visit became evident now that this was a more serious issue. Once the results from the x-ray came back, we knew that this was not going to be like any hospital visit any of us have ever experienced.The doctor explained that Gage had a large mass on his chest that is completely covering his heart and lungs. The Doctor then began to explain that there was a medical transport team in route to have Gage immediately transported to Dayton Children's Main Campus Hospital. After hearing this heartbreaking news, it was hard to comprehend much of anything the doctor was saying. But one thing stuck with me, and that is how persistent the doctor was in making sure we understood that the “c” word would be in the conversation over the next few days.After a few days of no sleep at Dayton Children's and multiple tests run on Gage, the results were in and they were not good. Gage was officially diagnosed with “Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia” also know as (ALL). It’s hard to believe that someone so young and innocent could draw such bad cards at no fault of his own, or anyone for that matter.T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia is treatable and has a survival rate of 90% in kids. Though this certainly does not change the severity of the situation nor does it make it less scary for Gage’s parents, family and friends, we are blessed knowing we will get through this with the kind hearts of others.Let’s face it, there is nothing more ugly in life than seeing what cancer can do to those affected by it. And when I say “those affected”, I mean the ones who are burdened with the disease and EVERY loved one around them. But nothing is worse in my opinion than watching a helpless child suffering in a hospital bed, confused, tired, sick & wanting nothing more than to be healthy and normal again.Though I am not a parent myself, I imagine my brother Mikey and his wife Brandy are going through far worse pain than what Gage is experiencing. I know that they would trade places with Gage in a heartbeat, as would I. And as if that heartache and pain wasn’t enough on their plate, they now have to worry about how they are going to pay for what’s needed for Gage to survive. Mikey is the sole income for his family, there is no way he can do this on his own. AND HE WON’T!!!I want Mikey and Brandy to focus on Gage, which is where their attention needs to be. It sounds easier said than done, especially since Gage has at least 3 years of chemo treatment ahead of him. But GOD always provides to his children and he will certainly provide for Gage.All funds raised will go towards medical bills for over the next three years. Gage will have 18+ spinal taps, 3+ years of chemo, blood and platelet transfusions, xrays and the multiple high costing prescriptions each month. And through GOD and prayer, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE! We will get through this and will be stronger in doing so, but I would be lying if I said we could beat this on our own. Michael, Brandy, Gage & our family will need all of the help we can get!Welcome to TEAM GAGE & Thank You For Any & All Efforts!!!Sincerely,Stephen BrownGage's Uncle",cf487326642486078dfb8b693170dbb1,27,0.0754,180.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

After several trips to his Primary Care Physician and a CT scan, he was referred to an ENT. During the ENT exam, the doctor noticed several lumps in Todd's neck which raised more concern then just his sinus issues. On April 21, 2016, Todd underwent surgrey to remove and biopsy a lymph node in his neck. On April 28, 2016, the Biopsy report stated it was Non-Hodgkins B-cell Lymphomia.Todd and Tina made 2 trips to MD Anderson in Houston,TX. Todd was diaignosed with Chronic Lumphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Stage 4 with cancer filled nodules throughout his body .  He also has an enlarged spleen with nodules on both his spleen and lungs that the doctors are  keeping a close eye on. Another complication recectly came up- Todd just learned he has a specific genetic mutation that makes him unresponsive to chemotherapy. Due to this, Todd is planning to participate in a new, 2-year clinical trial where treatment can only be received at MD Anderson in Houston.  Todd has and will continue to undergo many blood test, CT scans, and  bone marrow biopsies.   Althought he is allowed to participate in this clinical trial, Todd & Tina are partically financially responsible for all tests before, during and after the trial and one of the medications during the clinical trial. Todd is a retired Command Sergeants Major with 25 years of service with the Louisiana National Guard.

I'm Magnolia (Nol) Espedido and I created this campaign to raise funds for the medical expenses of Bien Dimalanta who is battling cancer. I have known Bien since Bec Dimalanta (Bien's mother) and I have been friends since we worked together in Ford Motor Company in the Philippines. Now that my family and I are based in Toronto, Canada, we still keep in touch with Bec and the rest of our Ford and ex-Ford friends. From the time that we learned about the latest milestone of Bien's battle, all of us felt the urge to act and do something that will help the family with Bien's rising medical expenses. Since I'm miles away from the rest of our friends, I volunteered to start this gofundme campaign because it's not availabe yet in the Philippines. The rest of our friends in the Philippines are planning other fund-raising activities.All funds collected from this campaign will be initially withdrawn by myself and transferred to my CAD checking account. Once funds are received, I will directly transfer the money to Bec's bank account in the Philippines.Please read the story of Bien below . . . ========================================This is Bien!This is the story of Bien's battle with cancer . . .Bien is a typical kid - jolly and playful. At an early age, he showed interest and passion for sports. Bien knows every NBA player but he cheers for the Cavs especially Lebron.  He also likes to bowl and in fact he bagged the 1st place in one of his games. Bien is into tennis as well with Nadal as his favorite and the list doesn't end there. He keeps himself updated with FIFA cause he's interested with football too. On August 8, 2008 ( Bien was only 3 years old that time ), he started to have on and off fever for a few days. Initially, the family thought it was dengue.  But Bien started to complain of  body aches. They can't even touch Bien because it was so painful. Bien became weak that he can't even stand up.After initial tests were negative, a bone marrow biopsy was performed and it was confirmed that he has Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (also called ALL or acute lymphocytic leukemia) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated.Bien went through a series of chemotheraphy treatment in the Philippines. After 3 years, he was done with the chemo but still had to go for maintenance check-up for the next 2 years to be declared cancer-free. But after 1 year and 7 months the same symptoms occured and the doctor said he had a bone marrow relapse. Now they are back to zero - Bien have to do all the chemotheraphy all over again.On April 2015, the family has to relocate to Bangkok, Thailand because of Marivic's ( Bien's mom ) work.  Bien continued the treatment in Thailand which he completed on June 2016.In Nov 2016, during his scheduled off theraphy visit, Bien was noted to have an enlarged left testis. It was later confirmed, bone marrow and testicular relapsed. He went through radiation and back to chemo sessions. This time, cancer is too strong and his system is no longer cooperating. There were complications that he needed to be in ICU twice.The family has now decided to have a bone marrow transplant but he needs to be in remission (have less cancer throughout your body) to have it. The doctor said that given the resistant behavior of his leukemia cells, his chance to have a remission is very less therefore, the potential curative treatment option is CAR T-cell theraphy. It is a process of re-engineering the Tcell and when administered back to the patient will recognize and kill the cancer cells.This treatment is still on clinical trial stage but the family are lucky enough that Bien's doctor coordinated in the US and referred Bien to a hospital in China who later accepted Bien into the program.The insurance reviewed the case and confirmed that they will not cover the expenses. The estimated cost for the CAR T-cell theraphy is $30,000 and another $30,000 for the bone marrow transplant. This doesn't include travel costs, accommodation and living expenses for the family. IT IS EXPENSIVE!Bien's family needs help! And they need it right away. Bien's life depends on it. Their families and friends have been supporting them the best way they can. And now, Bien needs YOU more than ever.Every single dollar will give Bien a chance at life, a chance he truly deserves.All your prayers, support and donations are very much appreciated by the Dimalanta family.THANK YOU!For donations in the Philippines, you may directly deposit it to their bank account.  Details found below:BPI SavingsAccount Name: Joshua Bien L.

Riley will receive weekly chemotherapy treatments in her new hometown of Kansas City, at Children’s Mercy Hospital. Riley has access to the uppermost quality of care and her team of doctors have the highest hopes that she WILL go in to remission.

It is my hope that we can lighten that burden for them.  Riley is an inspiration to us all. She faces cancer with an intelligent mind, extreme vigor, and natural wit. Anyone who knows Riley knows of her kind soul and her ability to laugh in most uncomfortable situations. She can outthink you before you ever saw it coming. She asks questions that only a PHD student  would think of. I joke that next book in her extensive list should be the Illiad and the Odyssey, but its not really all that far fetched. To hear Riley laugh is to know hapiness, and to see her smile is to know the stuff that only fairytales are made of.Please join me in Raising Riley. Raising funds for her family.

He always displayed a love for life and being active but lately was not being himself, his color was pale and was napping excessively. We had to take him in to see his Doctor, something just wasn’t right . On December 21st, 2017 we go the news that our little boy had to be admitted to the hospital. We got there as quickly as possible, so many questions running through my mind. More blood work and medical jargon. Finally a diagnosis, Acute undifferentiated Leukemia. My 8 year old son, my Bub, would need to start blood transfusions and need a bone marrow transplant. As if that wasn’t enough “he has to start aggressive chemotherapy immediately”. It took all of me to not roll into a ball and give in to the incredible pain and emptiness I felt. His whole life, from the moment I felt his first kick, I kept him safe, I was his shelter, found ways to make him better, but now there is nothing I can do. I am powerless! I can be brave for him and I am trying. I hope he can’t see the worry in my eyes! Hello My name is Tuesday,I am the proud aunt and cousin to these two amazing human beings and I feel lost. You hear about families that have overcame such an illness but you just never think it will happen to you or your family. As a mother myself I can’t imagine this pain and despair. I am sure with everything going on there is no time to think of finances. This is the only way I can think to help, I am not a doctor, I don’t have what Xhavier needs. Doctors are predicting my nephew will have to spend the remainder of 3rd and 4th grade in the hospital. And I too don’t know what else to do, I just have Faith and this request for support !

He is a great person, with a huge heart. Myles and his family are going to need lots of love, support, and prayers to get through this extremely difficult time. Myles is currently at UNMH undergoing chemotherapy and blood transfusions for the next 4-6 weeks.

Myles will also need around the clock care in a sterile setting. He has a long road ahead of him to fight this.The financial burden that a diagnosis like this has on a family is unfathomable. I have seen the power of medical fund contributions before, and am reaching out for any help that we can provide for Myles and his family.

And now, perhaps you know what it is to be heartbroken, to be shaken, to be on your knees in prayer.  On December 20th, after several weeks of a lingering cough and other common symptoms this time of year, Danielle took Quinn to the pediatrician. An exam and initial blood work were performed, which indicated something deeper was going on, beyond a mere cold or the flu. Danielle was advised to head straight to Lutheran General. Over the course of the past 48 hours Quinn has been diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, which is the most common childhood cancer. Due to Quinn's age and blood cell count, she is in the standard range.  At the moment, doctors are working to get a port in and will then start chemo. The goal is for Quinn to be able to go home at some point next week, returning for treatments every Friday for a month. After that month the doctors will assess how the chemo worked by conducting another round of blood and bone marrow tests. Regardless of these results, Quinn is looking at a minimum of two years of treatment and dosages. As daunting as that sounds, the medical team has regularly expressed assurance that Quinn will overcome this and go on to live a healthy life. The future holds many unknowns, but what Joseph and Danielle are confident in is the character of God; that He is who He says He is and will do what He has promised. [Isaiah 43 ] “Fear not, for I have redeemed you;     I have called you by name, you are mine. 2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;     and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned,     and the flame shall not consume you. 3 For I am the Lord your God,     the Holy One of Israel, your Savior... There has already been an outpouring of prayer, encouragement, and inquiry as to how to step in to help during this time. There will be many stages in the course of this journey. Currently Joseph and Danielle are rotating between permanent support at Quinn's bedside and being present and engaged in navigating this experience with the boys. As they continue in the day-to-day needs before them, there are several things you can do that will make a profound impact:1. Pray- Joseph shared the following: ""We fully believe in the incredible power of prayer by God’s people. Please pray for our gentle, sweet, vibrant Quinn, for a path that would lead her to complete healing. Pray for Colt (6) and Kase (2.5), that they would understand what they need to and that the toll of these next months would be minimized for them. Dani and I also need prayer; we desire to make the wisest choices for Quinn’s treatment, and we want to be the best parents to all three of our kids through this. We also need prayer to not live in fear and worry. Please include our doctors in your prayers, as well. God has equipped very smart, compassionate people to help others, and we pray that our doctors and nurses have absolute clarity regarding treatment for Quinn.""2. Persist- There will be moments in the weeks and months to come where the reality of what lies ahead will settle in. Let's resolve to be steadfast in support of this family, to listen to the Spirit's promptings to check-in, to pray, to listen, to speak words of truth. While Joseph and Danielle may not be able to respond to every communication, let's continue to secure and re-affirm our love for and loyalty to them, particularly in the long haul.3. Give- The last thing any parent in this situation should be thinking about is finances. And yet, it is a reality that even the most financially sound individuals will reckon with in time. The initial goal set here is a means to allow Joseph and Danielle the peace of mind to continue prioritizing what matters most during this season- their children. If you are able, a gift of any amount will help fill in the gaps as the bills start to accumulate and will continue to provide them a soft landing place as treatments stretch on.  We can't thank you enough for being the people Joseph and Danielle can lean on. May the echo of the days to come be an exhaustive example of what it means to love and to be loved in return.Warmly,Quinn's Family

I am hoping to raise $5,000 to cover the rising medical expenses that will not be covered by health insurance.  Any donations may also be used for travel expenses as the children's hospital is 200 miles from their home.  In addition, Evan has 2 siblings so there will be child care expenses to cover as well.  Any and all donations are considered to be a true blessing to our family.  They will help to ease the financial strain to provide Evan with these necessary medical treatments in his battle against Leukemia.  Our family will be eternally grateful for any financial support we receive.  Thank you in advance from the bottom of our hearts.  Team Davies",3e87fada17fb2c0da5345f045ae3f3c5,23,1.0402666666666667,570.0,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Let's show her the love and support she has always given to us. Give what you can, if you can.    - Yolanda & Rizza _________________________________________Dear friends and family,Yolanda and Rizza started this fund on behalf of my little brother, Captain Wright.On September 9th, 2017, the day before Hurricane Irma hit Orlando, my 13-year-old brother, Captain Wright Jr. was found by his father, Captain Wright Sr.—yellow and semiconscious in his bedroom. Captain was rushed to the emergency room and immediately started on blood and platelet transfusions. When we got the phone call from his father, exclaiming he was at the hospital receiving blood and platelets, something just didn’t seem to add up. How could a healthy 13-year-old boy need emergency care like this? What had happened between now and the last time I saw him just a few weeks prior?Finally, the doctors sat my mother, Cori Adkins, and I down and old us that Captain has Leukemia. After many tears and demanding answers as to why, the doctor described this type of cancer hits hard and fast with almost no obvious signs. No matter what, no mother wants to hear the words “your son has cancer”. We as a family did not realize how sick my brother was in the few months leading up to his diagnosis. He is a VERY humble child and never complains, but that day he had the strength to tell us that he has been feeling very ill as well as collapsing due to feeling so weak. He was suffering through all of this alone and was extremely private about his symptoms.Throughout this past week, he has ONLY been positive and strong for the entire family. He has done nothing but show respect for his hospital staff, following directions, and listening closely to how he must go about his new life. My brother is an avid skateboarder. He loves outdoor activities—fishing, swimming, and paddle boarding to name a few. But currently, he is very vulnerable to illness and infections, forcing him to press pause on many of his favorite activities. Captain can be around friends if he wears a mask, sits far away, and doesn’t touch anyone; a hard fact for a very social and popular teenager. Everyone in close contact with Captain must have a flu shot and respect the boundaries the doctors set in place for him. Captain will be pulled out of school for the next few months due to the cancer treatments and his immune system. One of Cap’s favorite parts about his life is cooking with my mother and exploring new foods, but he will now have to adhere to a neutropenic diet so long as he is receiving chemotherapy over the next 3 years.Due to his immune system and new lifestyle, my mother must redo and rebuy many items in Captain’s room and throughout the rest of their home together. She must purchase washable covers and furniture that can be wiped down and disinfected daily for Cap. Not to mention purchasing new paint, rugs, mattress covers, better cleaning supplies, storage bins, air filters, toys for him that can be disinfected, new shower curtains, his own personal towels and items to be bleached… the list goes on and on and keeps adding up. My mother must also hire a cleaning service to help her disinfect the house and keep it dusted while she is still working full time. His immune system calls for a special diet where everything must be sterile, unopened, fresh, handled and cooked a certain way. He cannot eat leftovers at all.At minimum, Captain will be enduring a 3-year journey with Leukemia, receiving treatments and hospital visits weekly. Medicaid will only pay for so much during this entire process. Many other catastrophic medical and life-adjustment expenses will be coming out of his parent’s pockets. It does not feel good for our family to ask for financial support, but we cannot ignore the realities attached to my brother’s cancer diagnosis.The support and love from you all has been outstanding and he knows in his heart that he is not alone. Thank you to those who have reached out to us. A big thank you to those who have helped with the hurricane cleanup at my mother’s house, supplies, and food. The more support we receive, whether it is financial, physical, or emotional, the more time my family can spend focusing on getting Captain better. Words cannot describe how appreciative we are for ALL of you. Each doctor, nurse, family member, friend, acquaintance, and stranger has surrounded Captain with such an awesome shield of love and encouragement so powerful, I know for sure he will get through this.Thank you for your donations and taking the time to read our story,Andrea Adkins & Family",33ed68acd660662f39b231a31c458189,34,0.28,510.0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I'm diagnosed with one of the most aggressive blood cancer leukemia, which affects not only the blood but bone marrow as well. Due to my illness I lost my job and now I have already spent all my savings, this is why I desperately need your help. This is my second fight with cancer. About 9 years ago, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer in which I endured 6 cycles of grueling chemo plus 2 surgeries to stop the spread of the malignancy. One of the surgeries was especially complicated because of a very large tumor in my stomach ; my heart even stopped at one point. All in all, it took me roughly 3 years to fully recover. It wasn’t simply a matter of the physical side of the illness, but emotional as well: I was diagnosed with clinical depression. It was a long, difficult road to recovery from all aspects of that cancer, but I finally made it through.Therefore this recurrence of another form of this terrible cancer has hit me especially hard; again, physically and emotionally. In fact, with bad memories of the rough chemo I’d had to endure almost a decade ago, I almost gave up right then and there when I heard the diagnosis. I was thinking that I could not go through that again. But slowly I began to realize: my life is worth living. This fight is worth it, and I want to win. I truly feel that God wouldn’t have brought me this far, only to take my life away. I believe my odds at surviving will be better if I can put every ounce of my strength and energy - physical, spiritual, emotional - into fighting this Cancer. My hope for special treatment is in the USA. Unfortunately at this point there is no other place in the world that will save my life from this blood cancer, only chance i have is the States. I'm labeled by my doctor as terminally ill  and i have been given a limited life. I don't believe in limited live. We all live our lives as long as we want and no one can tell us the end. I'll fight until the edge of the world for my life. Please help me in my fight for life; I deeply appreciated.

On October 24th Pat was diagnosed with Acute myeloid leukemia (a fast moving form of leukemia) after rigorous testing. Then finding out this heartbreaking news the family was determined it would be treatable. A specialist preformed a bone marrow test which was then sent to an Oncologist in Prince George and Vancouver. Pat and Brenda (Pat's wife), were told on October 27th that this form was not treatable by the doctor. The tests determined it was terminal and deamed untreatable. Pat was given three to six months to live. Within the first month of knowing his white blood cells decreased tremendously which left his immune system depleted, leaving him highly vulnerable to infections. He started using natural immunity boosters which on his next blood tests appeared to sustain his white blood cell count. Pat and Brenda were informed of the CIPAG Clinic and of Dr. Castillo in Tijuana Mexico. Following up on this clinic via web, they began emailing back and forth with the clinic.

This is a cancer that spawns within the bone marrow. I was provided a course of treatment which involves taking two pills daily for an undetermined amount of time. I have been told it will more than likely be indefinite. To my understanding one of the pills (Hydroxyurea) is to bring my white count back within a normal range, the other pill (Gleevec) is a chemo pill. I have been able to obtain the Hydroxyurea as the cost is $60 monthly, however I have not been able to obtain the prescription for the Gleevec, as the cost for this is a little over $10k monthly. My oncologists office has applied for assistance with the manufacturer for Gleevec on my behalf, in hopes to aid me in obtaining the medication at a discounted rate. However, we still have not been provided the status on this request. So I have not been able to begin my chemo treatment. I currently do not have insurance that covers prescriptions, as I had to drop my insurance through my employer this past December when their rates increased. Due to having temporary custody of five of my grandchildren I couldn't afford the additional cost. I have obtained insurance through a private company, however this does not cover prescriptions. I am already paying for asthma and other prescribed medications out of pocket.This is a very stressful situation, I do NOT like to ask for help, I am usually the person caring for others.

She was below critically anemic, her white blood cell count was astronomically high, her platelets were dangerously low, and that she likely had lekemia. He insisted that we immediately make the drive to LAMC Kaiser to get her treatment started right away. Once there we were greeted with doctors explaining that she would be getting two blood transfusions and three platelet transfusions overnight and would have a procedure in the morning. The next day Kailyn underwent a bone marrow biopsy, a lumbar puncture, the placement of her PICC line and the first dose of chemo. Kailyn was then formally diagnosed with ""High-Risk B-Cell  Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)."" Soon after the procedure she began her first full chemo treatment. From what doctors and nurses have told us, this looks to be at least a three year journey full of treatment, doctor's appoinments, chemotherapy, and all around changes in Kailyn's everyday life. While we hope that the majority of her medical care should be covered by insurance, we will still have to find a way to pay the pharmacy charges for her daily cocktail of medication, the price of driving to and from Los Angeles at least on a weekly basis (if not more), and also making sure that Kailyn always has access to the freshest food at home (since we won't be able to go in public for a long while).  With these costs already beginning to pile up, we just hope that you understand that any amount given is sooo greatly appreciated on this fight to beat Leukemia!!   We also plan to do some updates through this platform!",9cdc76d602ed810009386c79577faece,13,1.13006,600.0,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

 My daughter is a 1/2 match which actually still works... Those who know me, and my family know that the last 6 years have been pretty eventful from day to day, month to month and year to year! I have a very aggresive form of leukemia that's proven to be pretty resistant to the chemotherapy I've been on all of this time. My white cell count fluctuates between 20-230(when a normal white cell count is 6-11) that's pretty painful and makes me fatigued,  and susceptible to strokes, aneurysms, blood clots, which I've had 6 of and heart attacks .......

Imagine qualifying for the narcotics hydrocodone, and dilaudid which is 8 times stronger than morphine for the past nearly 6 years! My form of leukemia gives you gout as a side effect. Imagine not taking pain medications unless you're in the hospital under the supervision of medical personnel, so that when you're on the streets. You can help support your family, emotionally, spiritually, physically and financially..... Imagine doing everything that you can internally, mentally to not live up to stereotypes.

I'm still a loving, husband, father and God-fearing man. That hasn't changed. I'm still fighting, still surviving, still living for now. I'm thankful for being married to a loving wife, who works her tail off to support our family by working to make sure our kids experience life to the fullest. I don't believe my wife's purchased a new article of clothing since 2013 for her or the kids. And if you pay any attention to me... it's all t-shirts and shorts....lol! Thrifty is our way of life. Why am I asking for help through Group funding? This transplant procedure is not a 1 day procedure.... It's a 4-6 week procedure on the minimum side. 2-6 months is highly probable.  With several months of recovery, coming in my very near future. (When I survive this ordeal). The procedure itself cost $1.6 million! It's 'mostly' covered by insurance, but not completely.  During that time on the transplant floor, my 3 youngest kids will not be permitted to see me in the flesh(because of high risk of infection for myself and the other patients on the floor). We'll be using daycare for my wife to support me in the flesh, overnight for children ages 7, 6 and 5.

Sick again after chemo, I had a blood infection.After four rounds of chemo, with many follow up visits, I had 303 needle sticks, 38 blood transfusions, 13 platelet transfusions, about 57 days in the hospital from 7 hospital stays, 12 biopsies, including 10 of them that were bone biopsies.  I also had an endoscopy where they did a biopsy and a liver biopsy.  I have an enlarged liver and an enlarged spleen.I am now in a trial study called""Phase I Study of an Oncofetal Antigen (""OFA"") Multi-Peptide Immunotherapy (""BB MPI 03"") In Subjects with Hematologic Cancer.  I'm told I was the first human being to receive the vaccine.  Before me it was just the monkey's I'm told.  More than scary, a long list of what might go wrong.  The hope is that the vaccine will work on me and on many, many people that will benefit as a result of my decision and others that followed me into this trial study.  The vaccine they hope will stimulate the growth of ""T Cells"" to fight off cancer.  So far I have received 5 of the 6 injections for the vaccine. Then they will continue to check on me for intervals through the fall of 2016.  The pharmaceutical company backing the study will then decide if they want to extend the study and give me more vaccinations.I need to continue to raise money on an ongoing  basis until I can get caught up on my bills, I've always paid my bills on time my whole life and have no money saved.   Your help will mean the world to me.   I want to be able to function more and more to help my family, my church, my community and to continue to praise God for all he has done.  Through God, I know he will stregthen me to do all things.",792eec823584a7dcc6604d2d3d783e9b,37,0.15157,1080.0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

My name is Pauline and I am starting a gofundme campaign for my youngest sister Charlene. At the age of 25 Charlene was diagnosed with Acute Leukemia. She immediately began chemotherapy and to our pleasant surprise went into remission. Unfortunately our celebrating was short lived. 24 hours after discharge Charlene had 2 brain clots and had a stroke (one of the side effects of chemo is blood clotting). She immediately underwent surgery and was put into an induced coma. The doctors were preparing us for the worse. Thankfully two months into the coma Charlene slowly started waking up. We soon realized that the stroke mostly affected her motor skills. The progress Charlene has made over the months is truly remarkable. After her release from St. Barnabos Hospital she was transferred to Kessler Institute in NJ. At Kessler she was taken off her feeding tube, breathing tube, and began intensive rehab. Kessler’s services were outstanding and helped Charlene regain some arm movement and leg movement. It’s so heartwarming seeing Charlene use her arms. She has learned how to comb her hair, brush her teeth, feed herself, and work her tablet! Her main goal now is to someday walk……….nothing would make our family happier than to see her walk one day. Due to health insurance policies and funding she had to leave Kessler and was transferred to a short term Nursing Home. Due to lack of staff and funding she was not getting the proper physical therapy that she needed to accomplish her goals.We received devastating news on March 29, 2016, that Charlene’s leukemia was progressive again. She was immediately admitted in the hospital and is now undergoing treatment, BLINCYTO. She is also on a waiting list for a bone marrow transplant. It’s been 5 days since she started her second round of treatment and so far her levels are going up, which is positive!Once Charlene is in remission she will again need additional rehab at a short term nursing home. Once treatment is fulfilled she will need proper equipment in order to be released and live with our mom. Currently, Charlene is still not able to walk and subsequently not able to work. She requires full attention as she is not able to properly take care of herself and still requires personal care and is now receiving additional treatment for her leukemia. This GoFund me Campaign will help raise money for the following: TRAM mobile lift to transport Charlene from a bed to a wheelchair, special ramps, additional physical therapy that her health insurance does not cover, and help towards the cost of medical bills which is now well over $30,000.

In 2014, he received his Bachelor’s degree and became a licensed Radiologic Technologist in a private hospital in Iloilo City, Philippines. In August 2015, a month before his 22nd birthday, Jeb was diagnosed with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML). CML is a rare type of blood and bone marrow cancer that slowly progresses and is caused by a chromosome mutation that occurs spontaneously. His body produces an enzyme that causes too many white blood cells. The diseased white blood cells build up in large numbers which causes the crowding of healthy blood cells and damage to the bone marrow. The normal range for a white blood cell count is 4.5-11 billion per liter. Jeb’s lab results showed that he had 498 billion WBC per liter. He was rushed to the hospital on two separate occasions because his spleen enlarged to 4x the normal size. The lack of health insurance/coverage in the Philippines has caused the family to shoulder the complete cost of chemotherapy. Like a lot of families, my sister’s family live pay check to pay check so they decided to try a more affordable and alternative treatment. He suffered from adverse effects of the treatment and was later told by the doctor that their plan of care was no longer effective. In order to fight leukemia, the chemotherapy treatment he requires would cost a little over $1000/week (Php 48,000/week)  My sister Delfa was widowed in 2012 when her husband passed away after being diagnosed with end-stage Pancreatic Cancer. Along with Jeb’s two older siblings, they have done as much as they can to financially support the medical costs of Jeb’s treatments. Jeb will need a lifetime of chemotherapy treatment and checkups. Family, friends and the community stepped in and provided support and prayers. As Delfa’s sister, I want to help relieve as much of the financial burden of the costs of chemotherapy, weekly lab tests, check ups, and the hospital stay. Please help my single parent sister and her family in their fight against cancer. We would be grateful for any amount of support you can provide whether donating to help with the cost of his chemotherapy, through sharing his story and most of all your prayers.

The first 9 months involve intense chemotherapy sessions and the remaining 20 months involve maintenance treatments. Children heal better when they can be supported by their parents. Full-time attention and presence will give Cassandra the strength she needs to complete treatment.

Baker with the family)(Christmas morning with the family)(So darned happy to be together)Ben's best friend from Colorado, Danny made a special trip to visit Ben while he is healing.  It gave Ben an opportunity to show Danny his beloved Seattle; and for Danny to get Ben laughing and releasing those endorphins, not to mention someone for both of them to talk to about their car obsessions!(Danny, Ashley and Ben on the Vashon ferry)Sadly the new year brought a setback for Ben.  He began experiencing significant GI graft vs host disease (GVHD) symptoms which left Ben very ill.  The treatment has included extremely high doses of prednisone and Tacrilimus plus other meds to suppress his immune system which has brought on even more physically debilitating side effects.  What’s next?  1. Tuesday, 1/15th Ben will have an endoscopy (from both ends) to take biopsies of his GI track in order to assess the severity of the GVHD and what the treatment looks like going forward.2. Tapering of his immune suppression medicine will be pushed back at least two months (so instead of beginning the seven month process in February, earliest will be April).3. Projected ability to return to work, even part time, could be pushed back at least a month (so April instead of March).4. His wife, Mom, Dad, brother and sister are adjusting work schedules to spend several days a week with Ben to assist with Ben’s escalated needs right now.(Ben at SCCA receiving IV fluids due to the increasing effects of the GVHD)This has escalated medical expenses and definitely was a setback emotionally for Ben and his family.  That said, Ben is doing everything in his power, with the support of friends and family, to remain positive and looking toward the future.I know each of you have given so much and on behalf of Ben, his wife Ashley, and his family I am asking if you could increase your prayers, good thoughts, notes and if you are able to add a financial gift now, it will help in so many ways from the small to the big.  Ben is on the next leg of his healing marathon and with the support from us all, he will have the strength to keep going.  God Bless, Ben & Ashley and family.   December 4th                                                                                     UPDATE -- DAY 81(Ben on his daily walk in his Richmond Beach neighborhood)Day 81 Today Ben turned 81 days post stem cell transplant and he is closing in fast on the 100 day post-transplant countdown toward freedom from 24 hour care!  A great deal has been happening since the last update for Ben. The beginning of November brought some tough symptoms that escalated over the first two weeks of the month and ended with Ben in bed and ill on Thanksgiving. Undeterred, his brother, sister, Mom, Dad and Ashley spent Thanksgiving with Ben; being all together was so important.  After many tests and a visit with several gastroenterologists it was determined that he had a mild case of Graft vs. Host Disease   of the upper GI.  Oral steroids were prescribed and luckily, they have seemed to calm things down, thankfully!  Ben is eating and drinking again and has gained a .5 kilo in the past week!  (Ben and the Gastroenterologist discussing treatment options)This past week he was able to walk 2-3 miles a day and had an all-time personal best on Friday, climbing 188 stairs at Richmond Beach Park!  He’s lost a good deal of his muscle mass, but his oncologist team is thrilled that he is pushing himself to walk daily in order to gain some of it back. Ben’s blood counts have been consistently in the normal range for a couple of weeks now with the exception of his red and white blood cells. These have been fluctuating between normal and just below normal. The doctors have been continually adjusting the doses for the immunosuppressive drugs and are hoping to have found the best dose. (One of the many late night visits to SCCA)Today Ben had an echocardiogram and on Thursday, December 6thhe will have a bone marrow biopsy.  The results of these two tests will tell us a great deal as Ben and his family begin to prepare for the upcoming discharge from the transplant team in a couple of weeks. Ben is a miracle in so many ways, and his ongoing positive attitude is what is helping with his healing, we are sure of it.  Your prayers, cards, messages and financial support is what is fueling his positive attitude…you are his army of hope and we, Ben and his family, are so very blessed by each of you.  May this season of joy and gratitude be felt by each of you and your loved ones, Ben & his family.October 18th UPDATE -- Day 35 (Ben, Moma and Ashley via facetime together as Ben receives the first of his bone marrow transplant stem cells)So much has happened over the past five weeks for Ben.  September 14th his bone marrow transplant stem cells arrived and were immediately transfused to Ben.  This was considered day 0.  (Ben's nurse presents the B+ Bone Marrow stem cells swaddled in a blue blanket to him as a preparation for the transfusion and his 'new birth')He remained in the hospital through September 30th, until the blood tests began to show neutrophils, his mucuscitus had healed enough so that he could eat and drink on his own, and his risk of graphed host disease was able to be managed.  Although the four weeks he was at UW hospital were tough as far as the effects from the chemo, immune suppressant drugs and host of other drugs he was on, Ben amazed his doctors and the hospital staff by being discharged a 7-10 days earlier than they projected.  We all believe it is his attitude and the love and prayers of his family and friends that are giving him strength to heal and heal quickly.(Ben's sister Brielynd helping to unpack to get Ben & Ashley's Richmond Beach town-home ready for Ben to come home from the hospital)Ben and Ashley arrived at their new townhome, which had been sterilized and purified in every possible way by his loving family and a host of specialists, on September 30th, day 16 for Ben.  He was tired, but happy and was so excited to take a shower and a bath and sleep in his bed.  For the next 90 days Ben will need a caretaker to be with him 24 hours a day.  His brother Max, sister Brielynd, Mom Deb, Dad Erik, Aunt Judy and of course Ashley are taking shifts over the next few months to make sure Ben is safe, fed, and laughs as often as possible!(Ben's first week at home, trying to find his tastebuds and an appetite again by hoping to enjoy some of his old favorites)Ben's days are filled with visits to Seattle Cancer Care Alliance for lab work, clinic and doctor visits and concessional scans followed by recuperating time and getting walks in as much as possible.  Ben continues to have good news on his tests and labs, which gives us all a boost.  He hasn't had any significant complications other than the nerve pain on his extremities, bottom of his feet and hands.  He describes it as if you have a 1st degree burn on the bottom of your feet and then you are having to walk on hot coals.  The doctors are working hard to find a way to help diminish the pain.(Aunt Judy (me) enjoys Seattle after Ben's morning at SCCA for lab work and doctor appointments.  They got some exercise in at Gasworks Park)(Ben's brother Max shaved his head in solidarity and support for his big brother)BIG NEWS DAYToday, October 18th and Ben's 35th day since transplant, he received wonderful news.  The preliminary results of the bone marrow biopsy Ben had yesterday showed NO FLT-3 leukemia cells!  His white blood cells, neutrophils and hemoglobin numbers are almost in the normal range; which is the best and most wonderful news we could get!  Ben and his aunt Judy celebrated with a hot donut from Krisply Kreme and a drive to Alkai Beach.(Ben and Ashley happily watch the sunset from Richmond Beach Park as they celebrate the good news today)There are many days and weeks of healing to go for Ben, and his attitude is carrying him through bouyed by the love, generosity, paryers and support from each of you.  Thank you for what you've done for this wonderful young man and his wife.  Your financial support has allowed for him to pay for his basic medical costs, living needs, and simple but crucial items like parking at the UW hospital.  He is hoping to receive some disability funds at the end of the year, and until then thank you for everything you do.  May God Bless, Ben and his loving family.                                                                                                                                                 September 12 UPDATE(Ashley helping Ben with his new picc-line care) (At UW Hospital)A lot going on these past few weeks.  After two weeks of intense testing on every major organ and body part to make sure he was strong enough to withstand the bone marrow transplant, Ben got the thumbs up last week Tuesday and on Friday, September 6th was admitted to UW hospital and started his chemo therapy. The chemo regimen ended yesterday and today is a day of ‘rest’ for his body; that is except for him beginning to receive the immune suppressant medications to allow for his body to not reject the new stem cells.  These medications have their own complications :( .   This chemo was so strong it will kill all of his bone marrow and he will be essentially on 'life-support' through continual blood and platelet transfusions until the bone marrow transplant stem cells are accepted by his body and then start to make new neutrophil; which if all goes well will begin to happen in about two to three weeks, and will take a year+ to be at 100%. Tomorrow, on Thursday, September 13th our Ben will receive the bone marrow transfusion of stem cells and he will be reborn so to speak.  When the new stem cells begin to ‘root’ and produce blood, Ben’s blood type will change from O- to B+ (the donor's blood type).  So, Ben will be new – literally, a newborn and his new birthday will be September 13th, 2018.  I invite each of you to find a way to celebrate Ben's Re-Birth-day  on the 13th.Ben is stable right now with and incredible positive attitude, and as the Chemo symptoms are beginning to start, we pray they are brief and tolerable.  We know Ben will be in the hospital at minimum through this month so please keep your prayers, support, kindnesses and generosity flowing because this is what brings Ben and his wife Ashley a few moments of joy each day.  You each are a blessing and thank you so so much for continuing to be there for us all!! Ben’s Address:Ben DeWeesUW Hospital1959 NE Pacific St. Cascade Tower – Floor 7NE, Room 7214Seattle, WA 98195(Aunt Carol came from Ohio to support her sister Deb, and to smother Ben and Ashley with her love and laughter)(Ben showing Aunt Carol the boat he captained to pay for college, while strolling the 'docks')(Brothers in B'ham)Ben and brother Max grabbing coffee at a local UW district cafe between Ben's appointments)(Ben's Mom Deb with her friend Cathleen, who opened her home to Ben and Ashley so that they could be close to the hospital through August.  You are a blessing Cathleen!!)Deb (Ben and Ashley too for that matter) has asked that I let you know that she fully intends to appreciate and thank each of you overtime for your incredible generosity.  You continue to be her army of strength.  If you would like to help in other ways, feel free to send me a FB Message.  Thank you and may God bless you abundantly!  Ben's Loving Family -PS:  To help me get the word out, you can share my link to your Facebook Timeline!”#family #poika #legend #carvana #thatdidntsuck #joblove #thenewwaytobuyacar #phoenix #az #carvendingmachine#carvanacountry #ditchthedealership #shakeitup #HQ #state48 #wwualumni #wwu #bellingham #seattlecancercarealliance #uwhospital                                                                                                                                            August 23 UPDATEIt has been five  very full weeks for Ben and Ashley; some good, some frustrating, some tough but laced with great hope, support and an abundance of kindness that continues to keep Ben's attitude positive!  Ben's week of Chemo on the 8th floor west wing of UW Hospital resulted in some increased and uncomfortable symptoms that were difficult, but he  managed to make it through.  Ashley and family were by his side making sure he ate and walked the floor when he could.  He was discharged and the two were happy to go to be with family in Bellingham and continue to heal from the chemo.  Unfortunately three days later Ben found himself with a fever and was admitted to St. Joe's Hospital where the next week he received numerous tests, blood and platelet transfusions and fluids while they made sure the fever was from the chemo and not an infection.  The stay was horrible in that the rooms were dirty, the floors filthy, some of the nursing staff didn't follow cleanliness protocols and the doctors didn't follow Ben's Seattle Cancer Care Oncologists' orders around medications and neutropenic care standards.(Ben and Ashley at St. Joe's in Bellingham)(Ben in St. Joe's with his sister Brielynd standing by)(Ben receiving platelet transfusion in Bellingham)Seattle Cancer Care had found the only leukemia oncologist in all of Whatcom County to conduct lab tests on Ben's blood and to provide the regular transfusions he needed.  This was so that Ben could be at home with his parents in Bellingham and wouldn't need to commute the 190 miles to and from Seattle every other day.  We knew this wasn't optimal when the oncologist told Ben on his first visit that he didn't treat AML patients because they needed too much and it was too hard :( .  When Ben came down with a second fever and a strange cough the entire family agreed he needed to go to UW Hospital and stay in Seattle to receive transfusions and care.  He was admitted immediately to UW Hospital where he stayed for five days while they ran multiple tests and provided him with blood and platelet transfusions plus numerous antibiotics to ward off any infection.   He had a few friends from gradeschool visit: Lea and Natalie.  They helped him laugh, thank you friends!!  Visitors have become so important to help Ben laugh and share his incredible wit (and car knowledge!)While in UW Hospital Ben's Mom's friend Shari Campbell brought a special gift all the way from Germany: a rosary that she received on her trip from someone who said it would bring healing for Ben.  And the thought and the energy of such a gift has truly been a blessing.  It is kindnesses from so many that are supporting Ben and his family in so many necessary ways.GREAT NEWS ARRIVESOn July 30th Ben got a phone call letting him know that a perfect donor match had been found and that his bone marrow transplant date was going to be scheduled for September 13th!!!!!  Ben's Mom let out a squeal of delight and the news was cause for celebration!  His donor is a 30 year old male who resides in the US.  His donors blood type is B+....Ben's blood type is O-; yet genetically they are a match in terms of his body receiving the marrow.  Since then Ben, Ashley and his family have been meeting with his Bone Marrow Transplant Team (He is on the Lime Team), the social workers, the nurses, the nutritionists, the oncologists, and a host of other team members to make sure this intense transplant process is successful and we all are aware of what to Ben will be going through and what to expect.  At the same time Ashley accepted a job as an analyst at Paccar in South Seattle and was to begin her job on August 13th (YAHOO, income and insurance).  Ben also learned that August 15th-30th he was to be scheduled for all day tests at Seattle Cancer Care (SCCA) to make sure that most of his organs and biological systems were strong enough to withstand the bone marrow transplant successfully.  So far he has gotten an A+ in every category!What this meant was that we needed to find Ben and Ashley housing in the Seattle area (suitable for an immune suppressed individual and within 30 minutes from UW Hospital).  Ben and Ashley had been on the waiting list for the SCCA housing options, but nothing was available.  Mom and family looked at every possible rental, airbnb that was even remotely affordable and struck out.  So Deb put out the call to all her friends and wonderful WWU alumni for help.  Help arrived!  Thank you Cathleen for opening your home to host Ben and Ashley through August!! Deb wanted me to share that she was so moved by the ideas, possibilities and offers of help for finding a place for Ben and Ashley - a special appreciation to Tina & Rob, Lynn & Alex, Fritz & Di, Kay, Cathy, Wendy, Scot, Chris, and so many others for helping!Ben is scheduled to be admitted to UW Hospital on September 6th.  He will begin five days of some very toxic chemo therapy to kill all of his bone marrow.  He will begin his bone marrow transplant on September 13th and it will be a rebirth in so many ways, one being that in the end his blood type will be B+.  He will have 100 days beginning on the 13th to accept the bone marrow, and begin to heal and start to produce hemoglobin, platelets and white blood cells again!  He will remain in the hospital through September and then be released into the 24 hour care of his loving family. There is a great deal to be done over the next few weeks including four mandatory classes for those that will be caring for Ben; but we are all so very excited for what this will bring to our Ben: a complete healing.You are a such a big part of Ben's healing and team.  Your prayers, good thoughts, gifts and support are making all the difference for Ben, Ashley and his family.  We appreciate the blessings you are sharing with us and hope to have you with us as the journey continues.Ben's short term disability support ended this month, which makes your financial gifts so important as they continue to offset a portion of his growing medical costs;  truly a blessing.   - Ben and family –If you would like to help in other ways, feel free to send me a FB Message.  Thank you and may God bless you abundantly!PS:  To help me get the word out, you can share my link to your Facebook Timeline!”#family #poika #legend #carvana #thatdidntsuck #joblove #thenewwaytobuyacar #phoenix #az #carvendingmachine#carvanacountry #ditchthedealership #shakeitup #HQ #state48 #wwualumni #wwu #bellingham #seattlecancercarealliance #uwhospitalJuly 19 UPDATEThe next leg of this healing marathon begins.(Ben with Ashley and his Momma in his UW Hospital room)On Tuesday, July 17th Ben was admitted to UW Hospital to begin another round of chemo therapy called FLAG.  He will remain in the hospital for the next 10-15 days for the chemo and observation.  Ashley is staying with him and his family is there every moment they can be!  His room (above) is called the 'penthouse' because of the amazing view of Lake Union and the many boaters.  His little brother Max is working not too far from the hospital so makes sure he has some 'brother-time' daily.    This week he also spent time meeting with his hematological oncologist and the bone marrow transplant team.  It was a head spinning experience of information, options to be a part of research studies and possible complications from the transplant.  The healing process and rigor of the medical follow up protocols are complex but successful in the end.  The one item that is continuing to be a bit of a concern for best treatment options is making sure that his heart is not only back to 100%, but that it remains that way - which we are all happy about!(Reviewing the mountains of information about bone marrow transplant)The great news is that they have found several possible bone marrow match donors but will now refine to the best match with further testing which could take up to two months…..once that perfect match is found then they start the process of preparing Ben for the transplant process….more to come on that…We also learned that his lead bone marrow transplant doctor runs two research labs focused on FLT3 AML, Ben's leukemia type and has been practicing at SCCA and Fred Hutch for over 20 years.  His hematological oncologist is ranked in the top three in the world for leukemia; he is in good hands!The 10 days before Ben had a bit of R&R time in Bellingham in between his regular visits to Seattle for blood and platelet transfusions.  Family and friends made sure to visit and keep his spirits high and smile bright! Ben, Ashley and our entire family are so very blessed by your gifts, cards, thoughtfulness, visits, and of course prayers!  This is fueling his positive attitude, which remains impressively strong and allowing him to focus on healing and not worrying.  Your financial gifts continue to offset a portion of his growing medical costs;  truly a blessing.  Thankful for you all, - Ben and family –#family #poika #legend #carvana #thatdidntsuck #joblove #thenewwaytobuyacar #phoenix #az #carvendingmachine#carvanacountry #ditchthedealership #shakeitup #HQ #state48 #wwualumni #wwu #bellingham #seattlecancercarealliance #uwhospitalJuly 8 UPDATEThis was a BIG and busy week for Ben, almost like being in a vortex.  He and Ashley finally arrived home to Bellingham Monday night, July 2nd after 10 hours of tests, blood & platelet transfusions, and meeting Dr. Estey at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA). What a head spinning experience!!!  Deborah was so glad to see her own bed & her labradoodle Sweety after five weeks in AZ!He was back at SCCA on Thursday for a bone marrow biopsy, echo cardio gram, and five hours of blood and platelet transfusions.  Ben’s echo cardio gram results from last week were good, showed his pumping strength is back to normal yahoo!!  No bone marrow results yet...this week for sure.  These results will set the course for the next phase of his treatment.   His neutrophil and hemoglobin numbers continue to go down sadly, which results in his feeling flu-like, exhausted, and neutropenic :(.  We’re (mostly Ashley & Ben) are making the 180 mile trek down and back to Seattle Cancer Care Alliance every other day for platelets and blood transfusions (12 hour days).  All of this really adds to the stress and complexity, but Ben’s attitude is so very positive and he is happy to be home and surrounded by so much love .   His best friend from AZ, Danny made a special trip to visit Ben while he was at SCCA getting a transfusion.  It gave Ben an opportunity to show Danny his beloved Ballard; and for Danny to get Ben laughing and releasing those endorphins, not to mention someone for both of them to talk to about their car obsessions!Erik did his part today to lift Ben’s spirits by popping the hood of younger brother Max’s car so he could replace a few parts while Ben stood by offering words of auto-wisdom.  And, Ben drove Erik’s Toyota Tacoma (Ben’s first driving experience since May) to Squalicum Harbor; that is after Deborah sterilized the entire cab of the truck!He, Ashley and our entire family are so very humbled by your gifts, notes, ongoing support, help, encouragement and of course prayers!  This is sustaining him and us all.  Your financial gifts have already begun to offset some of his medical costs;   a blessing.  Thankful for you all, - Ben and family –#family #poika #legend #carvana #thatdidntsuck #joblove #thenewwaytobuyacar #phoenix #az #carvendingmachine#carvanacountry #ditchthedealership #shakeitup #HQ #state48 #wwualumni #wwu #bellingham #seattlecancercarealliance###### Update 6/30/2018  ######Great news!!! Ben has been accepted as a patient at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance with collaboration at the Fred Hutch!! He has his intake appointment at 1pm on July 2nd.  We anticipate they will schedule his bone marrow biopsy for the next day or two and then will determine when he will be admitted to begin Phase 2, which will require another 4-week hospitalization.  In between he’ll be home with us in Bellingham :).   This is GREAT for Ben and the family, and clearly shows the incredible improvements Ben has made in order to formally be discharged. He is very eager and excited to get back to his home state and be closer to his family and friends up there.He was released from Mayo Friday, back for more platelets on Saturday.  Ben’s employer Carvana is flying Ben, Ashley and Mom  first class to Seattle Sunday (July 1) morning.  Erik, Max and Breezi will meet them with a wheelchair and a van to transport.  They’ll have to stay in Seattle, close to Hutch, Sunday night.  Ben will remain neutropenic for the foreseeable future. So mask, avoiding any germs or undercooked foods or fresh fruits, veggies will be in order.Also, during Ben’s time in the ICU his wife Ashley had to stop working from her recent job in Phoenix in order to be by Ben’s side each day and to move with him to Seattle. This was a very difficult financial decision for them to make but she will begin a Puget Sound job search as soon as Ben is settled.   They have expressed such appreciation for the tremendous amount of support that everyone has shown and hopefully are willing to continue to it, to  enable Ashley and Ben to move and begin new treatments in Seattle more easily. They are incredibly grateful and know they aren’t going through this long and difficult process alone.Having said that, Ben and the family are incredibly grateful for his employer Carvana, and the Carvana Buying team for their assistance and support. They are flying Ben, Ashley, and Deborah (mother)to Seattle, as well as moving Ben’s/Ashley’s household from Phoenix to Seattle. Ben and family feel thankful for the continued support from Carvana and everyone that is helping this transition from Arizona to Washington be that much smoother.Deborah has been with Ben in Arizona since Memorial Day Weekend and she plans to be back working at WWU on July 5th :)!!! I’m sure you all can understand how excited she is to rejoin society outside of a hospital (5 weeks later)…!!! The outpouring of prayers, cards, well wishes has been sustaining Ben and the entire family; not to mention the financial gifts through GoFundMe. These funds are allowing for Ben to pay for some of the medical bills that are beginning to flow in.  A blessing.  Thankful for you all, - Ben and family –#family #poika #legend #carvana #thatdidntsuck #joblove #thenewwaytobuyacar #phoenix #az #carvendingmachine#carvanacountry #ditchthedealership #shakeitup #HQ #state48 #wwualumni #wwu###### UPDATE 06/20/2018 ######We wanted to update everyone on Ben's recent improvements with regards to his heart status and leukemia treatments.He has not had any episodes (i.e., heart failure) for the past two days and getting more energy by the minute. He has been able to move out of bed, do basic tasks, and even was able to walk around the ward a couple times. His energy and spirits continue to grow with the support of the family and the Mayo staff by him . He still is battling pneumonia while on-top of everything else so this Ox is doing quite well despite all the obstacles that are thrown at him.The siblings unfortunately were not a complete match for the bone-marrow transplant but the clinic is actively looking at the online data base to find a 100% match.The hope is for him to transfer out of ICU in the next 24hrs which allows him to go off intensive care. His heart and his vitals are showing fantastic improvements.The full bone-marrow biopsy report came back and unfortunately Ben still has roughly 12% blast cells (leukemia) in his bone marrow. This means that a new round of chemo therapy will be needed in order for him to be in remission ( < 5% blast cells). The goal is for him to get one final biopsy next week in Arizona and then continue his chemo treatment/bone marrow transplant at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance in Seattle, Washington.His family continues to wish the upmost support from friends, family, colleagues, etc during this difficult time. Each and every dollar that you are able to contribute now and into the future will help pay for these treatments and re-locating him up to Seattle.Each share and every donation is allowing the world to them and will continue to help ease the transition once the recovery period begins.Thank you for all the on-going support and prayers and we will update you again soon!Blessings to you all!##################### 06/09/2018 ########################My nephew, Ben DeWees, 30 years old was recently diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia with a rare high-risk mutation (FLT3-ITD).  He just finished his first round of chemotherapy at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona and waiting for his second biopsy to  demonstrate treatment effectiveness so far.Unfortunately this cancer is really aggressive and the treatment and recovery path are going to be long and arduous.  He is awaiting a bone marrow transplant  and further chemotherapy treatment.   Right now we are praying one of his siblings will be a perfect match! After the bone marrow transplant, he will be in intensive treatment and round the clock care for several months (minimum of 100 days with no complications) until they can declare him ""in remission"". Ben and his beautiful wife Ashley will be moving back to Washington State to complete the bone marrow transplant and further treatment.  Fortunately, Ben and Ashley will have a large, extended network of family and friends there to give them care and support.  As I am sure you can imagine, this is not only a physical and emotional strain but also a financial strain.  Ben has only been at his job for a year and half and Ashley, who just graduated college in May, started a brand new job in the midst of all of this.  To be honest, Ben and Ashley don't have enough money to cover the out of pocket medical expenses (minimum $6500), moving expenses, and basic living expenses while Ben is in treatment and recovery.    If you are able to support Ben and Ashley, please consider donating to this cause to take this worry off of their minds and let them focus on healing and recovery.  Please also continue to pray for Ben, Ashley and his family - they can feel all the prayers, support and love!  If you would like to help in other ways, feel free to send me a FB Message.  Thank you and may God bless you abundantly!PS:  To help me get the word out, you can share my link to your Facebook Timeline!”",0583cc28bbbb27470d822c1e87abc1a6,187,0.5785,240.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

Ashton had spent the summer getting ready and looking forward to his Freshman year at Round Rock High School. He was enthusastic about having the opportunity to walk in his family's footsteps of being a RRHS Dragon Football player. Throughout the early summer Ashton enjoyed hanging out, playing ball outside and engaging in other social activities with his close friends and family; nothing out of the ordinary.This particular week Ashton stated that he ""did not feel well."" The over zealous teen had a fever for several days. Initially, the fever responded to the usual anti-febrile measures, but then surged into an all out war. His fever spiked to over 103 degrees, it was at this time a teenage boy asked to go the the hospital. Thinking he would get some fluids, perhaps some anti-biotics and head home to recover it was difficult to process the nightmare that came next. . . . ""Your son has a form of leukemia.""""He needs to be life flighted to Dallas Childrens Hopsital immediately.""""He is in critical condition.""Leukemia?Critical?What? Ashton, is this right? Within the first twenty-four hours of arriving at Dallas Children's Hospital Ashton underwent a PICC line placement, bone marrow biopsy with spinal tap and a battery of blood work. The studies revealed the final diagnosis:T-CELL ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA.There was no questioning in his mind EVER! Ashton was always told he was a fighter, he was always told he was a warrior. He made up in his mind he would win this fight. He is Ashton Strong!Ashton will undergo treatment for the next three years. The Wolf family needs help to make this journey less of a financial strain.

Angel rushed Erika to the emergency room on Saturday at 5am.  They believed it was something that was going to be treated easily. After running a series of test, the doctor diagnosed Erika with (AML: Acute myeloid Leukemia) a very aggressive form of Leukemia.This has been extremely hard on this amazing couple and a complete surprise to all family and friends.

You see 2 years ago, Rob's wife Jackie gave him the only blood relative he has ever known, his beautiful daughter Aurelia.

We have been together for 18 years now, and are coming up on our 13th anniversary. We knew early on that planning a family would be a challenge because of Steph being diagnosed with PCOS, which decreases the likelihood of pregnancy. Against these odds, 7 years into our marriage and 3 months into a deployment, our son Liam was blessed into our lives in 2009. He is the major reason we decided to leave the Army after 10 years of service and focus on our home and family. Unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful at providing Liam any siblings, but he finds sisterly love in his relationship with his 10 year-old aunt, Hope.Liam is one smart cookie. He has a passion for learning. His passion lies with math and science as he loves to tackle problems meant for children at least twice his age. He is learning how to blueprint for inventions, and has three companies he plans to ""get running before I'm 18."" He also loves solving puzzles and drawing mazes. Whenever he takes interest in a subject, he devours whatever he gets his hands on and tries to find real world use for the knowledge. He's an amazing 6 year old.He has a kind, generous heart that always looks for chances to give more than he receives--to pay it forward. One of his latest acts of kindness was cutting his long locks short in order to donate it to those who need his hair. Liam's depth of emotion and selflessness has been an inspiration to me and others around him from the start, even before this life-altering challenge. It's brought out an even stronger and more emotionally complex personality from my son.Liam and Hope at Star Wars: Episode VIIIn the days leading up to Christmas, Liam started complaining of pain in his abdomen. At first we took it as simple constipation, but after some detailed and concerning explanations of his pain, we took him to acute care as a precaution. After days of intensive testing, and many escalations from acute care to PCM to ER to childrens oncology, he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, on Christmas day. The pain in his lower abdomen turned out to be a mass associated with the diagnosis. Since his diagnosis, Liam has gone through several chemo treatments and steroid doses, biopsies of the mass and bone marrow, spinal taps, insertion of a port (or portacath) for IV access close to the heart, as well as fingerpricks and insulin for extremely high blood glucose - a common reaction to the steroid medication, dexamethasone. It's heart-wrenching watching him try to come to terms with it all, to keep a smile on his face for visitors, and ""wish things were back to normal."" As I mentioned before, he's smart for his age; he has been soaking up all the information from his doctors, trying to stay ahead of the curve, and thinking of ways to outwit the process. He started demanding the name of his disease almost as early as we did. He's been requesting the medical terms for every procedure and medicine and piece of equipment used in his treatment. He's been counting carbs of his own volition to try to keep his blood sugar down. It took a few days for him to accept the doctors' explanation that his glucose number (at times above 500) have little to do with his apparently excellent new low-carb diet. It's also hard for him to accept (being a hair-guy) that his treatments are so strong that they attack some good things on their way to making him better, including his hair. He has been in the children's hospital since, isolated due to his compromised immune system and under constant oncology supervision. He was allowed to go home two weeks in and switch to out-patient treatments, only to have him re-admitted when the first outpatient treatment blood draw found his numbers through the roof. They say the intense ""induction"" phase will last a month, and that total treatment will run approximately 3 years. Currently, the three of us are trying to take it one minute at a time.On top of all of this, he had to deal with the news from his hospital bed on New Year's Eve, that the family dog Buffy passed away. By this point, we're definitely ready to call 2015 what it was and move on to a better 2016!Since this has started, we have endured many expenses that quickly racked up passed what we can handle. We also missed and forecast missing work while we focus on support to our son, and continue to organize things outside of the hospital for eventual home care and outpatient chemotherapy. Friends and family are doing what they can to support us, and we are so grateful and sorry we can't find the energy to say it as much as we think it!Many people, friends and family, and patients in the hospital, came together to make Christmas as enjoyable as it could be for Liam and us, and we truly appreciate it. Steph and I are staying strong for each other and for our son during this difficult time. We are determined to focus on getting through treatment and winning this together. We want Liam to, as he put it, ""beat the boss guy!"" and move on with living his long and exciting life.Please help us help our little guy. 60 years ago, leukemia patients had no chance of survival, but through time and funding, technology and medical research, my son has a chance at a normal life. Your contributions will go towards easing the financial burden of Liam's fight against cancer. If we are fortunate enough to exceed our goal, the remaining funds will be donated to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society to further leukemia research and support other cancer patients fighting the fight. As a family, we believe in helping improve the well-being of others by paying it forward to the next Liam.

At that appointment their Pediatrician suggested bloodwork should be done to find out more about her current symptoms.  The next day they learned that  Paige had a very low count of both red and white blood cells. The doctor then told Liane she needed to see a specialist in Oahu immediately. Paige and her parents (Jordan and Liane) were in Oahu the very next day. At Paige’s first dr appointment in Oahu the Pediatric Oncology specialist informed them that she most likely had Leukemia. They now needed to give her other tests to confirm the diagnosis and also to determine what type of Leukemia they were dealing with. On Monday, November 12th Paige was checked into the Kapiolani Hospital. In the early morning she was given a bone marrow biopsy and they spent the day waiting for the tests to determine which of the “two evils” of Leukemia Paige was diagnosed with. Time seemed to stop, the anxiety to hear the news grew greater and greater with each passing second. In the early evening the doctors came back with results, Paige is diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, it is a cancer involving the blood-forming cells that normally make a type of white blood cell called a lymphocyte. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia starts when a single young blood forming cell, called a Lymphoblastic developed a series of mistakes that transforms it into a leukemia cell. The leukemia cell multiplies uncontrollably, crowding out healthy cells in the bone marrow. As of this morning, Tuesday November 13th Paige started her first round of chemotherapy treatments that is the start over the course of the next 5 days. We know times in the end are getting harder, tougher and unbearable. We are asking friends and family to continue to keep Paige and the Kawasaki’s in your prayers.  Also,  if your able to please donate to her page.

Once inside, she stepped onto a treadmill but felt like she’d pass out; she went home. When she didn’t feel better later that day, she went to a local clinic to figure out what was wrong. Blood tests showed she was dangerously anemic and had an extremely low platelet count. Pearl needed an immediate blood transfusion to survive which is not available on the island.Within 45 minutes of the results, friends had packed her a bag and Pearl was on a medical flight to Anchorage for an emergency blood transfusion. In Anchorage, doctors told her the reason why she was so sick—she had leukemia. She needed immediate treatment.Hours later, she was airlifted again, from Anchorage to Seattle and then finally to her hometown of San Diego. The road to recovery was long and hard: doses of chemotherapy, months in intensive care, blood transfusion after blood transfusion. Fortunately, her brother was a match to donate bone marrow and Pearl is extremely tough. After a year of treatment, she beat cancer. The leukemia went into remission and by September 2015 she was healthy enough to return to work. Her position was relocated to the Seattle office so that she could continue to be monitored by specialists.Beating cancer is expensive, and over the course of more than a year, Pearl had depleted her savings and then some. But as a testament to her character, she became an advocate for raising money for others experiencing similar financial issues. When she returned to work she became an integral member of a team for the “Combined Federal Campaign,” a philanthropy program that allows federal employees to pledge a percentage of income to eligible charity programs. In a matter of months, Pearl's group raised over $50,000. Pearl always puts others before herself.In March 2016, Pearl was offered the opportunity to return to Dutch Harbor for a couple weeks of fieldwork in April. She was elated, two years from the date she could return to where it began; a real milestone to overcoming cancer. On March 8th 2016, Pearl was at a routine check-up, anxious to get the green light from her oncologist to go to Alaska. But then, she saw her blood work, her heart sunk. More tests were ordered and a week later, she learned the leukemia had relapsed. Pearl will be starting chemotherapy immediately. She decided to receive care in Seattle because of the world class doctors available. Her treatment is complicated by the fact her brother can’t be a bone marrow donor again. Her mom took leave from work and flew up to be her full-time caregiver. They need our help, prayers and support.Please donate to help relieve some of the financial burden associated with cancer.

 Noe was in Japan the first two weeks of June. While there, she wasn't feeling well. After returning home, she was still under the weather. She was finally able to see her doctor on Tuesday the 25th. Blood was drawn for testing and an IV was administered. Soon after, she was sent home. Later that evening, Noe received a call from Kaiser Moanalua advising her to report to their ER immediately! Upon arrival, the doctor informed Noe that her White Blood Cell count was 170! Noe was hooked up to an IV and soon was given a Platelet Transfusion to try and counter the white blood cells.  


At 1:00 Wednesday morning, Noe was admitted in to Kaiser Moanalua for monitoring. Later that morning, Noe had a bone marrow biopsy and given another platelet transfusion. And then, the answer to her question was finally answered that night. The results of her biopsy was positive, she had Leukemia! 


Thursday morning, Noe was moved to Kaiser's 2nd floor where she started chemo treatment. For now, she will be there for an undetermined time for treatments and monitoring.  


This is why she needs our help! Noe is self employed and pays totally out of pocket for her medical insurance, etc. It is yet to be determined how many treatments or what kind of treatments she will need to fight this disease. Love and moral support is a neccesity but any financial assistance is greatly appreciated!

Adrian was a healthy little man full of life and energy.On July 24th 2015, after 5 days of fevers, we took Adrian to the doctor and requested blood work to be done on him. The very next day the doctor called us with the results. Adrian had an abnormal blood count and the doctor instructed us to rush him over to the emergency room for further testing.While at the hospital, only 2 days before Adrian’s 4th birthday, he was diagnosed with cancer in the blood (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia).After 2+ weeks at the Children's Hospital, Adrian’s condition has been stabilized through intensive sessions of chemotherapy and drug treatments. Unfortunately, Adrian is still very weak and in major discomfort due to the adverse reactions of the chemotherapy, not only that but he is also required to be in isolation due to his compromised immune system.

Growing up in a Cuban family, you learn to love your cousins as siblings. My fiancé, Danny, is an only child, so Yordis is like a brother to him. He helped bring him & his wife from Cuba almost 7 years ago so they could live the American dream like the rest of us. Just last year they were finally able to save enough to buy their first home. Just over a month ago, we were all struck with the most unexpected & unimaginable news. On February 23, 2018 he went to the hospital with horrible abdominal pain, only to be diagnosed with a rare and aggressive kind of leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Under the care of an exceptional team of oncologists, within a few days he began the 6-week course of induction chemotherapy. After approximately 3-4 weeks, he developed a coagulation problem, medically termed D.I.C. (or disseminated intravascular coagulation). In short, the body enters a state of rapid coagulation, where blood clots form throughout the body’s small blood vessels and can damage multiple organs. As the body’s coagulation factors and platelets are used up, less of them are available throughout the body and serious bleeding can occur. Luckily with rapid and extensive treatment, doctors were able to stabilize him, with some complications along the way. Unfortunately, his white blood cell count did not respond to the first round of chemotherapy as anticipated, so a second protocol was attempted & fortunately his body responded! With heavy doses of chemotherapy, came significant weight loss, weakness, vomiting, etc. Nonetheless, he is a true champ and has endured the past few weeks and stayed strong. Currently he is undergoing continued chemotherapy and being prepped for a bone marrow transplant. A transplant is the only way to potentially cure the disease and save his life. The procedure is very expensive and his wife has been fortunate enough to be able to stay by his side throughout the process so far. However, they are in need of ongoing financial support to continue the battle and fight this! We need your help. Any little bit counts & I promise to keep all those who donate updated. Thanks on behalf of our entire family. We will not give up & with faith & hope we know we can fight this!

Él ayudó a traerlo a él y a su esposa de Cuba hace casi 7 años para que pudieran vivir el sueño americano como el resto de nosotros. El año pasado finalmente pudieron ahorrar suficiente para comprar su primera casa. Hace poco más de un mes, todos nos sorprendimos con la noticias más inesperada e inimaginable.El 23 de febrero del 2018 ingresó en el hospital con un horrible dolor abdominal, solo para ser diagnosticado con un tipo raro y agresivo de leucemia, leucemia / linfoma de células T adultas. Bajo el cuidado de un equipo excepcional de oncólogos, a los pocos días comenzó el curso de 6 semanas de quimioterapia de inducción. Después de aproximadamente 3-4 semanas, desarrolló un problema de coagulación, médicamente denominado D.I.C. (o coagulación intravascular diseminada). En resumen, el cuerpo entra en un estado de coagulación rápida, donde los coágulos sanguíneos se forman a través de los vasos sanguíneos pequeños del cuerpo y pueden dañar múltiples órganos. A medida que se agotan los factores de coagulación y las plaquetas del cuerpo, hay menos de ellos disponibles en todo el cuerpo y se puede presentar una hemorragia grave. Afortunadamente, con un tratamiento rápido y extenso, los médicos pudieron estabilizarlo, con algunas complicaciones en el camino. Desafortunadamente, su cuenta de glóbulos blancos no respondió a la primera ronda de quimioterapia como se esperaba, por lo cual se intentó un segundo protocolo y afortunadamente ¡su cuerpo respondió! Con grandes dosis de quimioterapia, hubo pérdida de peso, debilidad, vómitos, etcétera. Sin embargo, es un verdadero campeón y ha resistido las últimas semanas y se ha mantenido fuerte. Actualmente se somete a quimioterapia continua y se está preparando para un trasplante de médula ósea. Es la única manera de asegurar que se cure de esta enfermedad y lograr salvarle la vida. El procedimiento es muy costoso y su esposa ha tenido la suerte de poder permanecer a su lado durante todo el proceso hasta el momento.

Mia is a 5-year-old cutie, with Down's Syndrome. She has always been energetic and a ball of fun. Around Halloween, 2017, Mia began experiencing severe bone aches. Fevers, a decreased appetite and weight loss began shortly thereafter. Little Mia has been sick and weak, on-and-off, since then, and has had limited abilty to walk, due to the pain she's been experiencing. Mia's parents checked her into the Children's Hospital on Friday, January 20th and yesterday (January 24th), her test results confirmed she has Leukemia. Mia has already had to undergo two surgeries this morning - one to put a port inside her chest, and the second, a cerebral poke, to determine if the leukemia has spread to her spial fluid. Given Mia's disgnosis of Down Syndrome, treatment of her Leukemia can be a bit tricky, as she may not accept the medications as well - they may prove toxic to her body. We are asking for any support you can provide to the family during this difficult time, as the last thing we want them to worry about is finances. With the cost of treatment, hospital stays, compounded by missing work, we are hoping this fund can reduce that stress!

Their son Dominic, who is 5 years old, was diagnosed with Leukemia and has now been admitted to the hospital. From what we’ve been told, he will be there for a few weeks and is having a procedure on Monday with chemo being started immediately.Like so many, we want to help them in this time of need, so I have decided to start a gofund me account for them for anyone who wants to help. Tony and Jennifer are extremely grateful to have so many family and friends wanting to help out and send care packages to help Dominic, his twin brother Vincent, and their older brother Cameron, cope with this journey. However, by their request, if you would like to help please consider donating the money you would have spent on the care package. They are by no means asking for donations, but with everything going on: they just bought a house, they live 30 minutes for the hospital and drive back and forth, and they are supposed to be moving into their new house next weekend, anything helps. They have already started to receive a lot of gifts and don’t want to receive gifts that will not be used or potentially tossed or given away, due to so much going on.As you know medical bills can and will pile up, so if you are wanting to help in any way, this would be a great way to show support or even just sending a kind message letting them know that they are in your thoughts and you will pray for Dominic’s quick recovery.Again, they are not asking for you to donate, but want this to be a way for you to contribute if you want to help. If you would still like to send a care package for the boys (Dominic & Vincent -5, Cameron 11) please contact me and I will give you their new address. Thank you,Kathy Cole",79a243a2f17a1ed5187b5319f7cddaca,9,0.69475,1230.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

I went down to UCSF to have the diagnosis confirmed in the beginning of 2016. They said the cure to MDS is a bone marrow transplant. Instead of going through with the risky procedure (15% chance it could be fatal), I asked if it would be safe to wait a year so I could do a few exciting things before the procedure. The doctor said I should be fine given the diagnosis. Within that year I planned a trip to Disney Land, got engaged, moved to Oregon,and went on a cruise with my family. Positive stuff. Unfortunately, more negatives happened than positives.I got so sick I was bed ridden and had to cancel the trip to Disney Land, my fiance left me the day our trip was actually planned for, then was hospitalized the next day due to a giant blood clot that had formed in my right leg. While in the hospital for this enormous clot, they found that pieces had broken off and gotten to my lungs. Thankfully the clots weren't big enough to kill me, but it raised some concern with the doctors. Not having the technology to break this clot up, the hospital had to fly me to a bigger hospital in Portland, OR. While in Portland, they were thankfully able to MOSTLY deal with the clot. (I'm still currently taking medication to try and deal with it fully. Hopefully only one more month to go.) While in the hospital, I was also diagnosed with Crohn's Disease (which explained my stomach issues, but we'll come back to this).I was discharged two weeks later and picked up by my loving mother, and my brother (and my bone marrow donor). I decided to stay in Oregon a little longer and was able to stay with some friends. They, and a few others, helped me clean my stuff out of my, now old, apartment and move it to their garage for a temporary holding. My doctors didn't want me to work anymore, so I lost my job and cannot work until the clot is all gone.About a week after getting home, I received a call from the Portland Doctor saying I may not have Crohn's and might have been misdiagnosed. Yay! No..I may have an even more rare disease called Behcets. I still have yet to get the final diagnosis on that, though I finally have an appointment to find that one out.So, since I've been home, I've been constantly dealing with doctor appointments, setting up the transplant, and getting everything together financially.Moving forward on the MDS stuff. I went down to UCSF to get the ball rolling. They did some blood work and told me a bit more about the procedure. I'm not sure if the chances changed, but they told me now there is a 10% of failure (instead of 15% :D). They also found something called Blasts on my cells, calling for a biopsy. So we did a Bone Marrow Biopsy, as I posted about last week, and we finally got the results. I was called today and told that I have Acute Leukemia. I'll have to start Chemo as soon as possible to fight that before we can start the Bone Marrow Transplant (which requires a different kind of Chemo Therapy). Do to the Chemo, I'm having to contact a Fertility Clinic so I can ensure that I can have future children of my own..and the prices aren't pretty. Thankfully my family and close friends have been supportive through the whole thing. Not to mention the family members willing to put their lives on hold to be my caregivers through the procedure.

I know that not everyone has been through this, but for the ones that have, I'm sure you will agree with me saying that till now you still feel that you are just stuck in a bad dream...or at least hoping it's just that. A really bad dream. 


Sadly, it wasn't. Next thing you know, he was in the hospital with tubes and needles 24/7. I should say now, that I live in Gainesville, FL and at that time my brother was still in Peru. I hopped in the first available flight. On my way there, all I could think about is seeing him, hugging him and telling him how much I love him, but he was in such extensive care that the only way for me to get inside was with a mask, a hospital robe, and tons of foam alcohol. Even with all that, I had to stay at least 1 meter away. 


Days, weeks and months passed. We noticed he got a little better, but the doctor would always tell us not to put our hopes up, because the type of Leukemia he has(Acute Leukemia T-Cells) is an aggressive one. The odds were and still are against him. I was already back to the US by then, trying to seek help from everywhere and anywhere, but nothing. It was so bad that even the hospital from the school I go to (Shands UF Health) closed its door on my face. They didn't even bother to at least orient me where to seek help. 


From back home things seemed to be getting better, at least that is what I was told. Then one day, all of a sudden, my dad called me from the airport letting me know that they were on their way to Houston. Abjit had a paralysis and they didn’t know what to do, so they decided to go to my uncle's place and take him to closest hospital. Luckily for us that place was MD Anderson (the best for cancer in the world). They accepted him there and right away they discovered that the leukemia cells went all the way to his brain. Apparently, the hospital in Peru didn't provide him with the right amount of medicine and chemotherapy he needed.  



We wanted to try taking him to St. Jude (a charity hospital which already declined him once) but Abjit didn't want to. When he talked to the doctors and nurses at Anderson, he felt so secure that he started feeling much better emotionally. After so many months, we saw him smiling and laughing again. His hopes high rocketed with them. So, even if we wanted to take him somewhere else, we couldn’t because of his delicate condition. Any stress or worry would put him in a coma. That is why we decided to keep him there and start looking for different ways to get money. 


It's been a over a month. He is now feeling better. Doctors said that he will be ready for a bone marrow transplant pretty soon. They might even do the radiotherapy (for his facial paralysis), the transplant and ...all the treatments he needs at the same time. That is really great news for us, because it means that there is hope he would get better. But the truth is that we didn't expect all this to be so expensive. The money just flew away from our pockets to their bank accounts. 


I love my brother with all my heart and I will do everything for him, but today he needs more than that. Our hands are tied and GoFundMe is our last hope to provide the best possible treatment for him. He needs your help... Bills are to the roof and anything can help. The transplant will occur on august, and after that he will be in extensive care. He has to do it when the doctor says so, otherwise his health can worsen.Please share this with everyone you know. Its our last hope and a last chance for him to be able to live a happy childhood, and get the life he deserves. 


Please share this as much as you can and remember that help, big or small, is highly appreciated. We would always be grateful to you.",b21d6cd6ecc0d4b95ca9aa3d15f17b17,43,0.02556,570.0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme

After having her examined for a seemingly simple sore throat, Emmah was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  She was immediately taken to Mott’s Children’s Hospital at U of M where treatment began within a very short time. Emmah has already had two rounds of chemotherapy and is remaining strong through it all, even somehow making all of those around her laugh while starting the fight of her life. Emmah will have to remain hospitalized for the next few weeks while the beginning chemo treatments are given. She is receiving the very best care possible here, but it will be a long road for her treatment, recovery and care.Over the next two years, Emmah will have to receive several more rounds of chemo as well as be in and out of the hospital for any treatment issues that may arise. She’ll have to miss her first year of middle school because the risk to her health is too great to be around large groups of people. There are several obstacles to overcome, but if anyone can do this, I know in my heart that Emmah will. From the moment Emmah was diagnosed, her parents, my brother Jason and his wife Tamarah, have never left her side. Tammy has taken a medical leave from work to care for Emmah and Jason has been able to take time off of work to be at the hospital as well. As anyone could imagine, this vigilance takes a toll on this family, both emotionally and financially. I am setting up this GoFundMe page for Emmah’s parents in hopes to relieve some of the stress of immediate expenses and bills so they can focus completely on their daughter’s health and treatment. Emmah has an older sister, Vedah, that is not allowed to stay overnight with Emmah so there is a lot of travel between home and the hospital as well.  We know this journey isn’t going to be easy, but we also know that Emmah is a fighter and she will beat this disease with the same bravery and strength that she has shown us all so far. We have already received such an outpouring of love and support that has taken this family by surprise and Jason and Tammy are so appreciative of it. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

One afternoon while Alohi and her father were playing, he noticed a rather large lump on her outer right thigh. Initially we thought it was just a muscle spasm. The lump rapidly grew to the size of a large egg which physically deformed her limb. We immediately took her in to the doctors, where they preformed a biopsy and found that the unknown mass in Alohi’s leg was cancerous. On November 19th, 2013 at the age of 7, Alohilani was diagnosed with Blastic Plasmacytoid Dentritic Cell Leukemia. Previously known as the Natural Killer Cell Leukemia. An aggressive rare cancer to adults, and extremely rare in children.     Her oncologist stated, she is the first child to be diagnosed and treated in the state of Hawaii. Their is little information known about this type of leukemia and no established treatment. A team of specialist, locally and nationally, formed, agreed and supported a treatment plan for Alohi. Doctors predicted that she had a 70% chance of reaching remission. Immediately, a Port-A-Cath was implanted in her upper chest and treatment was started. She began taking numerous types of pills, to intravenous chemotherapy and even multiple spinal taps. During the course of her treatment Alohi has also gone through multiple blood and platelet transfusions.     At the young age of 8, Alohi had endured an immense amount of pain, experiencing many awful days of weakness, chills, high fever, nausea, vomiting and difficulty breathing. Thus making it impossible for her to attend school. However, she has had a few exceptional days of fun with friends and family which we cherish, but they seem to be so few and far between. Remission was achieved and gave everyone in our ohana a brief moment of relief. Unfortunately, on Thursday, August 13th, 2015, after 21 months of treatment, we took her in for a routine test and results revealed Alohilani had suffered a relapse. The leukemia had returned and traveled to her brain fluids causing her to have very painful headaches.     The doctor’s let us know that if a new treatment plan wasn’t implemented soon, Alohi would pass away in just one month. A very tough decision was made to continue treatment for Alohi. The second round of treatment would require a much stronger dosage of chemo, and for the first time Alohilani would undergo radiation. This would all lead to a bone marrow transplant, with the hope of finding a donor match. This time around doctors predict a 30% chance of survival for Alohi. Alohilani, now 9 years old, understands and accepts her difficult situation. She keeps herself busy by reading, writing, and drawing. Alohi and her family humbly ask for your prayers and support through these challenging times.

She loves the movie ""Coraline"" and has seen it ""like a zillion times."" She dresses up like Rapunzel (while singing ""In Summer"" by Olaf from Frozen), and likes to meet new friends at school and at church. She loves dogs and knows that when she gets one she's naming it Sunshine. And when she grows up, Gabs wants to be a Construction Worker so she can give people homes.Gabs is like SO many other six-year-olds in our country: endless energy, eyes full of wonder, an impossibly big smile, and a beautiful hunger for all that life is beginning to reveal. In short, she's coming into her own in big and powerful ways...and she was just diagnosed with leukemia. The FactsLike any parents who get this news, Jennifer and Jon were initially devastated, overwhelmed, and lost. Where do you begin to process cancer in a child? How do you make sense of something that wasn't even on the radar the day before? The unknowns seemed endless and visions of Gabriella's future, and their shared futures, instantly broke, morphed or halted. As tests came in and results were compiled, the facts started to arrive:1. The Good News: Of the two most common kinds of childhood leukemia, Gabs has the better one. It's called Pre-B (ALL) Leukemia. The 5-year survival rate for children with this kind of leukemia has greatly increased and is now 85% with proper treatment!Shaving Dad's head...Mom is next!2. The Challenging News: The cause of Gabriella 's leukemia, however, is a rare mutation called iAMP21. Found in only 2% of leukemia patients globally, iAMP21 is a mutation of her 21st chromosome, which somehow causes her chromosome to produce cancer in the form of leukemia. It means that an aggressive, intense, and longer (usually 2-3 more months) treatment of chemotherapy is necessary. In more relatable terms, it means that: her body will be more exhausted; her immune system will be more fragile; her hair will be gone longer; and her energy, spunk, and sass will be needed more than ever! Gabs will be fighting a tough and persistent battle for the next three years. The Financial RealityThough we are beyond grateful for the hopeful prognosis, the financial reality of this literally life-saving treatment is staggering. In 2009, the average cost of pediatric hospital visits alone for children with leukemia was $55,900*. Add to this the incidental expenses that pile up: missed work for both parents, mileage to and from the hospital, adaptive equipment, and the ongoing expenses of six children and it quickly becomes overwhelming! In an effort to begin to tackle these expenses, our goal for this GoFundMe is $25,000.

I will strengthen you and help you; i will uphold you with my righteous right hand. ""Isaiah 41:10Hello family members, friends, and community,      My name is Maria Tercero and  today has been the worst day of my life.  On September 6, 2017, my mom was diagnosed with actue leukemia.  Acute Leukemia is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow, acute meaning that it is a rapid and fast acting.      She has been transferred to UCSF medical center to commence chemotherapy right away. This all happened at once and we do not know how or where we will come up with the money to pay for it. That is why I am asking for any type of donation because I know it will go a long way. I would also like to ask from you all that you keep me, my mother, and my family in your prayers.      Our family is small and my mom is my rock. She has been a hard working single mother all of my life. She supports her community and is a member of our church. This unexpected news has put a large stress on our family. Throughout this time we ask for your help. Your donation will help pay for everyday needs that will not be as easily accesible, treatment, and further medical bills. These donations will help relieve some of the emotional and financial struggles she will be going through. It will surround her with continued strength and navigate through this difficult path. We appreciate your help.        We are staying positive and know that God is here with us during this hardship. He is our Savior, our doctor, our everything and he will never leave us. This is in His hand and we are fully trusting in Him. GOD IS GOOD ALL THE TIME! GOD BLESS YOU!! ____________________________________________________________""No temas, porque yo estoy contigo; no desmayes, porque yo soy tu Dios que te esfuerzo; siempre te ayudaré, siempre te sustentaré con la diestra de mi justicia.""Isaías 41:10Hola miembros de la familia, amigos y comunidad,       Mi nombre es María Tercero y hoy ha sido el peor día de mi vida. El 6 de Septiembre de 2017, mi madre fue diagnosticada con leucemia. Leucemia aguda es un tipo de cáncer de la sangre y la médula ósea, aguda que significa que es una acción rápida.      Ella ha sido transferida al centro médico de UCSF para comenzar la quimioterapia de inmediato. Todo esto sucedió de una vez y no sabemos cómo o dónde vamos a conseguir el dinero para pagar por ello. Es por eso que estoy pidiendo cualquier tipo de donación porque sé que recorrerá un largo camino. También quisiera pedirles a todos ustedes que me mantengan a  mi madre y mi familia en sus oraciones.     Nuestra familia es pequeña y mi mamá es mi roca. Ella ha sido una madre soltera trabajadora toda mi vida. Ella apoya a su comunidad y es miembro de nuestra iglesia. Esta noticia inesperada ha puesto un gran énfasis en nuestra familia. A lo largo de este tiempo le pedimos su ayuda. Su donación le ayudará a pagar las necesidades cotidianas que no serán tan fácilmente accesibles, el tratamiento y otras facturas médicas. Estas donaciones ayudarán a aliviar algunas de las luchas emocionales y financieras que ella atravesará. La rodeará con fuerza continua y navegará a través de este camino difícil. Apreciamos su ayuda.        Nos mantenemos positivos y sabemos que Dios está aquí con nosotros durante esta dificultad. Él es nuestro Salvador, nuestro médico, nuestro todo y El nunca nos dejará. Esto está en Su manos y estamos totalmente confiando en Él.¡DIOS ES BUENO TODO EL TIEMPO!¡¡DIOS TE BENDIGA!!",d6d6dd5d205c1b46cd7b2f923b20490c,44,1.4034666666666666,510.0,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,,,0,0,0,1,Neither,gofundme
