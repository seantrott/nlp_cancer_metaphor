When she was diagnosed suddenly Sept. 2018, the tests showed it had already spread to the lymph nodes on the left side of her neck, groin and in the bone in the right hip area, with small shadows on the left kidney, lungs and liver. As conventional treatment offered no hope, she turned to reputable alternative treatments but kept on working as best she could from home as she is a translator to keep up an income. In December her condition turned critical and her sister Akari (a Mum of 3 boys, separated from her husband and living in America) came to Japan to support Uri, she realised drastic measures needed to be taken.  Akari rallied family, cousins and friends support to scrape together the $51,000 USD plus airfares to get Uri in to the Hope for Cancer clinic in Mexico and she stayed with Uri in Mexico for another 10 days until she came through some critical stages. But she then needed to get back to attend her children and start to prepare a space where she lives for Uri to come home to after her intensive treatment.She checked in to the clinic on December 29thand just in time to have life-saving stent surgery to unblock her kidney function. This cost another $6,000 they are yet to find with speciality surgeon follow up and treatment already beyond another $1500.The current estimates of future basic follow up treatment is another $25,000 USD plus airfares and covering all her own rental & usual living expenses without an income as she cannot work at the moment and currently needs a wheel chair for getting around.  Thankfully, with all the treatment and the tireless support of her sister Akari, Uri has jumped through some hoops and is doing everything possible to heal. If she can continue these treatments she has a real chance to heal from this nightmare.  But with her family’s funds already all but gone, they really need urgent financial  help and her sister Akari will also now be her full time Carer as well when Uri checks out of the clinic next Monday. The clinic doctors in Mexico will monitor and support for a year but from a distance and in correspondence with local clinics Uri will need to connect with in the area her sister lives. It is still undecided whether her best next step is to be in Japan where certain of the medications she needs are less expensive, or with her sister in Chicago where she has personal support and someone close to care for her. Either way, she will be facing way more than the current $30K USD of medical bills due this next week!!  So we have set a goal for 100K USD. Any and all funds donated to Uri will go directly to her sister Akari in Chicago, who is taking care of everything for Uri, including paying for all. Akari will also need to fly to Mexico on Monday to bring Uri home as well as she cannot fly without aid. Uri is one of the most giving, and loving people I know and is the first to help others. She was not comfortable with this idea at first but she realises that if she is to live, she needs to be willing to receive. So from the bottom of our hearts thank you for any size donation you can manage. Every cent counts and is appreciated more than any words can convey.  Naturally, all healing thoughts and prayers are also so deeply received and appreciated.  This kind of support from our greater global family will make it possible for Uri and Akari to focus more fully on helping Uri heal.  We will send regular updates on Uri’s progress. Thank you! Extra information from Uri’s ‘support sisters’ who set up this campaign.To the amazingly generous ""Earth Angels"" taking time to read this, thank you. We (Uri’s closest friends) have set up this GoFundMe page in the hope that, with your generous help, we can take some of the financial pressures, stress and strains off Uri and her family whilst she goes through life saving treatments, surgeries and recovery.   The money will go directly to paying for the life-saving surgeries, both past & future, specific medications for the type of cancer Uri has, the kidney dialysis and related treatments and to help cover some of the mounting monthly costs of consultant appointments, scans, pre and post-operative care, travel costs and all the other ‘unseen’ bills that seem to come out of now where at these times.  We will keep you updated on here status and the doctor’s decision on where her treatment will be best catered for from next week.Whatever the donation you can manage, we cannot thank you enough and tell you how incredibly appreciated it is by Uri and all her family as well. Love and blessings to you all!

Sydney lost her mom to a battle with breast cancer at age 14 and grew up constantly worried about her own increased risk. When Sydney discovered through genetic testing that she has the PTEN gene, a genetic mutation which predisposes her to breast and other cancers, Sydney took her life into her own hands, and this past June, she had a preventative double mastectomy. Sydney, a young woman with a degree in Political Science and Law, an ambition for a Master's degree, a lover of travel, all things Disney, and homemade ice cream, has proven countless times to have an unparalleled level of bravery and has seamlessly squeezed the lemons she's been thrown in life into sweet lemonade. Her smile is contagious, her laugh makes all the bad in the world seem easier to take on, and when I met Sydney this past January, I felt immediately connected to her beautiful spirit.Despite taking incredibly brave measures to prevent cancer, Sydney's life has taken an unexpected turn over the last few weeks. After experiencing excruciating pain in her abdomen, countless tests, scans, and surgery, Sydney was diagnosed with Ovarian High Grade Serous Cell Carcinoma. Throughout this process Sydney's status as a warrior has not wavered; her strength and positive energy are both admirable and inspiring. In order for Sydney to get the best care she possibly can, she will be flying from her home in Colorado, to New York to be treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Cancer for an aggressive chemotherapy regimen to tackle this disease. Anyone who has been through chemo or seen a loved one go through treatment knows that there is nothing more comforting than being in your own home, a place you feel safe and warm during a time of such uncertainty and fear. That's where you come in. Please join me in raising money so Sydney, the sunshine everyone deserves in their lives, can afford to live near the hospital during her treatment.

Fortunately, after this treatment, cancer disappeared for a while, and although it was a traumatic and exhausting experience —both emotionally and financially— my mother returned to her daily life, taking her medications and doing all the routine checkups needed every few months.For almost two years these tests yielded negative results until the end of this November when the doctors found a tissue in her breasts that turned out to be a lobular breast malignant tumor. Given her background as a cancer survivor, his doctor recommended that she should immediately undergo surgery again to prevent it from spreading throughout the body.Because of the urgency of the procedure, I gathered all the money I had in the bank so that within a few days she could enter the operating room as directed. The tumor was successfully removed, and we are just awaiting results from the biopsy in order to confirm it’s not spreaded, but my mom is already recovering, although she is still not at home. However, even though we were able to take care of the minimum necessary to make the hospital accept her as a patient, the amount of the medical bills exceeds all the fundings product of the combination of my solely work income plus the collaboration of a few friends who have helped us until this moment with the greatest discretion.Unfortunately, the full payment of the remaining invoices is required immediately. That is why despite having allocated all of our savings and salary to this task, we need to do this fundraiser to complete the necessary amount to cover these expenses as soon as possible.The funds will be used to pay for the operation, as well as to cover the post-operative treatment, including all the medicines and tests after the biopsy.Luckily, my mom is a warrior who has faced all of this without losing the giant smile that characterizes her.I want to thank everyone in advance for all your contributions and good wishes to her.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Luego de vencer el cáncer de cuello uterino en 2016, el 20 de Noviembre de este año mi mamá Omaira Ávila, de 69 años, fue diagnosticada de nuevo, esta vez de cáncer de seno.Para el primer tumor, a mi mamá tuvo que hacérsele una histerectomía, así como un costoso tratamiento de radioterapia que se extendió por meses. Por fortuna, después de este tratamiento el cáncer desapareció por un tiempo, y aunque fue una experiencia traumática y desgastante —tanto emocional como financieramente—, mi mamá regresó a la cotidianidad tomándose sus medicamentos y haciéndose los chequeos de rutina con disciplina cada varios meses.Durante casi dos años estos exámenes arrojaron resultados regativos, hasta que a finales de Noviembre le encontraron un tejido en el seno que resultó ser un tumor lobular mamario maligno, y que dado sus antecedentes, su médico recomendó que debía ser intervenido quirúrgicamente de inmediato para evitar que se le extendiera por todo el cuerpo.En vista de la urgencia de la operación, dispuse de todo el dinero que tenía disponible en el banco para que a los pocos días pudiese entrar en el quirófano. El tumor fue removido con éxito, y aunque todavía esperamos resultados de la biopsia para confirmar que no se ha extendido, mi mamá ya está recuperándose, aunque todavía no está en su casa. Sin embargo, a pesar de que pudimos hacernos cargo de lo mínimo necesario para que aceptaran operarla, el monto de las facturas médicas supera al de la suma de mi salario más la colaboración de unos pocos amigos que han sabido ayudarme monetariamente con la mayor discreción hasta este momento.Lamentablemente, el pago del resto de las facturas es requerido de inmediato. Es por eso que a pesar de haber destinado todos nuestros ahorros e ingresos actuales  a esta tarea, nos vemos obligados a hacer una recaudación por esta vía para completar el monto necesario y solventar estos gastos por completo lo antes posible.Los fondos estarán destinados al pago de lo que resta de la operación, así como para cubrir el tratamiento posterior a la operación, incluyendo medicinas y exámenes luego de la biopsia.Por suerte, mi mamá es una guerrera que se ha enfrentado a todo esto sin perder la enorme sonrisa que la caracteriza.De antemano quiero agradecerles a todos por sus colaboraciones y sus buenos deseos para con ella.",14bf8e90d06b6fca4a49c8d761940606,10,0.9497916666666667,30.0,2,1,mixed,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

That’s how it started. I had spent the weekend in Vermont skiing; visiting with old friends and classmates; and had nailed the job interview I’d made the trip up from Atlanta for—my first since finishing grad school a few months prior. I thought my life was about to take a turn for the better. But at 1:45am, as blood poured out of my body in sheets, a terrifying reality struck: I was alone, 1200 miles from home, unemployed, without health insurance, and in serious trouble. A short call to the only open hospital I could find made me realize something else: I needed to be home, near my family to face this crisis. So, I did the only thing I could think of: I prayed to God for the bleeding to stop. And then it did.A few hours later, I called on God again to give me strength to zip my suitcase; to give me strength to get my suitcase to my rental car; to give me strength to get to the airport; to give me strength to get to ticketing. Each step required more energy than I had to give. My heart pounded in my ears. More than once, I stopped to catch my breath, arms braced on my white rolling suitcase for support. How had skiing been so effortless only the day before? The Chicago Marathon felt easier than this. When I landed in Atlanta at 9:30, my stepfather met me at baggage claim and took me straight to the emergency room. Within two hours of arrival, I had been admitted.  A nurse wheeled me from Emergency and to a private room pushing the beeping heart rate monitor and the saline IV attached to my chest and arm. ""I don’t belong here, I thought."" A hospital is for sick people. For three days I endured endless tests, nurses in and out of my room at all hours of the day and night; latexed and lubed fingers poked my ass; needles stuck in my arm; humiliating and invasive questions about my health history; terrible hospital food, and starvation. “You need a blood transfusion,” they told me. “You’re severely anemic.” The normal blood count range for a female of my weight and age is 12-14. Mine hovered around 6. The next morning, doctors scheduled me for an emergency colonoscopy—the first of three I would endure over the coming month. When I woke from anesthesia after the procedure, my mother and sister were standing at the end of the bed when the surgeon said, “We found a tumor.”  My response was flat, perhaps because I was still drug-induced. “I know,” I said. “I knew that was there.” I thought I had hemorrhoids. A few hours later, they wheeled me to my first of two CT scans and scheduled the first of two MRIs. Images taken the first week of December revealed no detectable tumors in my liver or lungs, but did reveal a mass the size of an orange midway up my rectum, resting against my uterus. Based off the MRI imaging, on December 18th, they diagnosed me with Stage 3 adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Initial tests reported two lymph nodes involved. The tumor had penetrated all the way through the third layer of my colon. Metastasis could be imminent. Merry Christmas to me. No one wants to talk about the realities of cancer, especially colorectal cancer. No one wants to imagine what it looks like, or what it feels like, or what to do if it happens to them. I never imagined it would happen to me. But here’s the thing… it’s not the cancer that scares me. It’s the cancer treatment. Doctors recommend a total of 32 weeks of chemotherapy, five weeks of radiation, then a highly invasive surgery that will leave me with an ileostomy bag for six months. They tell me that I am in the curative phase, but then they tell me they can’t guarantee the cancer won’t come back. The long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation have me frozen in place, unable to accept that my only chances of survival are dousing my system with near-toxic levels of a substance originally derived from mustard gas.  Chemotherapy liquid that spills during IV administration, and any amount remaining following an injection, is treated as hazardous waste! Nurses dispensing the substance must wear protective clothing and masks… So how is it safe to inject directly in my veins???  Furthermore, according to the results of a 14-year study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in December of 2004 called, The Contribution of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy to 5-year Survival in Adult Malignancies , “the overall contribution of curative and adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to 5-year survival in adults was estimated to be 2.3% in Australia and just 2.1% in the USA.” Their conclusion stated that chemotherapy only makes a “minor contribution” to long-term survival. A minor contribution to survival, BUT life changing side effects to boot. Besides the chances of developing secondary cancers as a result of chemotherapy, some side effects include: sensitivity to sunlight, which may or may not go away, hair loss, loss of appetite, nausea, unusual tiredness or fatigue, dizziness, “chemo brain”—described as mental disorientation, brain fog, and cognitive impairment —which can last for years, changes in vision, sores in mouth or throat, diarrhea, vomiting, impaired immune system function, rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing/swallowing, nosebleeds, coughing up or vomiting blood or material that looks like coffee grounds (WTF?!), pink, red, or dark brown urine, unusual bleeding or bruising, and neuropathy—which could be permanent. Neuropathy is tingling in the hands or feet that renders a person unable to perform basic functions like zip a zipper or button a shirt. I’m a writer, so I pretty much need to be able to feel my fingers. Oh… and then there’s the side effect of infertility and sexual dysfunction. Also permanent. I may be on the slow track at 35-years old, but my long-term dreams always included being a wife and a mother. I guess I’ll need to re-think that. The FDA isn’t required to list emotional side effects of drugs, therefore they aren’t required warn you that weathering such symptoms may lead to depression, loss of identity, and extreme despair.To combat the side effects of the potentially deadly drug, doctors do exactly what you think… prescribe more drugs, which have—you guessed it—more side effects. To further the case against chemo, approximately 10-30% of people have a gene mutation that makes chemotherapy deadly at any given dose… meaning, even a little bit can kill you. And the only way to determine if you have this particular gene mutation is genetic testing (RGCC test, Caris test). So, I asked my oncologist, who urgently suggested I begin treatment immediately, if she planned on giving me this particular genetic test. Her answer? No —at least not until after treatment begins. That seems a little late and too big a risk for me to take, but this is the STANDARD OF CARE for cancer treatment in the United States. (For more information on the risks of chemotherapy, visit  https://www.know-the-risk-of-5fu-chemotherapy.com/. 5-FU  is the shorthand name for Fluorouracil, the drug my doctor has prescribed for me, and a common drug used in the treatment of several cancers.)Between the two rounds of neoadjuvent induction chemotherapy, each 12 to 16-weeks long, I would undergo five weeks of radiation therapy to shrink the tumor. In addition to carrying it’s own boatload of hefty side effects, high levels of radiation can cause secondary cancers as well—a new type of cancer that develops as a result of the primary cancer treatment. A new cancer from a primary cancer treatment! What’s the point? While advancements in medicine do include the benefits of targeted radiation, my tumor is in my pelvic region—a highly sensitive area of the human body packed with lots and lots of very sensitive organs. If chemotherapy doesn’t kill all the remaining eggs in my ovaries, five weeks of radiation certainly will. Other side effects include: diarrhea, rectal bleeding, bladder and vaginal irritation, redness and itching to the treated area, brittle bones (akin to osteoporosis), sexual side effects, and incontinence—or more commonly, the inability to control your bladder. Cool. So, in addition to carrying around a shit bag for six months after surgery, I get to wear an adult diaper, just in case I wet myself in public. Does the cost of treatment include a full-time nanny and an endless supply of baby wipes, too?If you’re still reading at this point, perhaps you’re thinking what I am thinking: there has to be another way. There has to be a better way. The answer is, yes, there is. Most of us blindly accept what a doctor recommends for treatment because that’s what society conditions us to do. But the truth is, the only person that will advocate for your health is you. Remember: Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine said, “first, do no harm.” When did our healthcare system abandon this truth? Can we make a stand and return to it? I believe we can. Thus, I am seeking a type of treatment—a way to heal the cancer—that doesn’t do the rest of my body (and the rest of my life) seemingly irreparable harm. I’ve become inspired by the books, Chris Beat Cancer , by Chris Wark, and Anti-Cancer, A New Way of Life , by David Servan-Schreiber, MD, PhD—both which promote nutrition as the true way to combat cancer. Both promote the use of juicing and raw food diets to aid in the healing process. Inside, one finds a wealth of knowledge on not only how to fight cancer naturally if you’ve been diagnosed, but also how to prevent cancer from ever occurring. I’m not naive enough to think that food alone will heal me. But, since my diagnosis I have drastically changed my diet to a raw food, whole plant based diet with A LOT of fresh-pressed vegetable juice, and in less than a month, I’ve already seen improvement. My tumor is shrinking. How do I know this? Because my tumor prolapses during a BM and I can see it. A part of the mass turned black then shriveled away. Doctors confirmed this was a positive thing. And now you know more about me than you (or I) ever wanted you to know. The conclusion? I am doing something right. But I need more. And I need help. Other therapies that exist are practiced under the guise of natural, holistic, or alternative medicines in the United States, and thus the stigma alongside them is one of disregard. But in places like Finland, Greece, and Germany—who has the highest cure-rate of colon cancer in the EU— these therapies are commonplace and even preferred. Therapies include treatments like IV-vitamin A, IV-vitamin C, IV-mistletoe, IV-curcumin, far-infrared light therapy—which uses heat to kill cancer cells, hyperbolic oxygen chamber, Rolfing—a form of soft tissue massage to help with bodily alignment, acupuncture, mind-body therapy, and many, many others. The problem is these treatments are not covered by insurance because they are not accepted as “medically necessary.” But for someone in my situation who believes there is a safer, healthier alternative to healing cancer, they are my only hope for long-term survival. Our bodies were never meant to be poisoned.During the past six weeks of my life, I’ve been called stupid, and was told that I am dying by members of my family that disagree with my choices. I’ve been blatantly told that if I do not listen to what doctors recommend, then I do not have their support. At times, I’ve never felt more alone. So, I am leaning on God for guidance to a safer way to heal. Through answered prayers, I was lead to the books Chris Beat Cancer and Anti-Cancer, A New Way of Life. And it is through these books that I have hope for a better way. Now, I am leaning on God once again as I urgently seek help from the public to fund my treatments. Its never easy to ask for money, especially because I am asking for help with medical bills that have accrued since my diagnosis—when I was uninsured—and that will continue to accrue, no matter what treatment I undergo. Thanks to the generosity of my parents, I now have insurance, but due to the circumstances of my health crisis, I am still unemployed. And until this battle is behind me, that is unlikely to change. The brutal reality is that, no matter what, I need medical help immediately. I’m just hoping for the least invasive, least harmful therapy possible. And with help from God and from you, I believe I can and will find a way to it.Please help me find and fund a better way for treatment before this cancer spreads. Donate a dollar. Donate a word of advice or recommendation to a doctor. Forward my story to friends or someone you know that may be able to help. Share with me your stories of success and failure when you were battling your own illnesses. Say a prayer for my healing. I can’t promise I will ever be able to pay back the money I hope to raise, but I can promise to pay it forward.

Before being admitted, he had lost his voice and had visible lumps on his throat. He went under several chemotherapy sessions and after several mistrials, he did a bone marrow transplant on June 1st. Two weeks later, he developed an infection which caused him to have trouble breathing. He went under bipap for three days which didn't help because he wasn't getting enough oxygen to his brain. Before intubation, fluids were taken out from around his heart due to pneumonia. This led the doctors with no choice but to intubate him for three weeks. During intubation, he was taking lasix to help empty the excess fluid in his body which continued even after getting extubated.  After being extubated, he began his road to recovery which consisted of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. He was in remission and was discharged from the hospital on August 22nd. After being discharged, he had a series of clinic visits every week which consisted of IV fluids and a multitude of medication. Five months later, he relapsed.This has now brought us to seek monetary donations towards paying for this second round of cancer treatments that is so badly needed.

A former United States Marine, Chris' ability to bear down and grit it out when the going gets tough is part of who he is.In fact, If you didn't know it and bumped into Chris 6 months ago, chances are that you would not have been able to detect that he was sick.

As you can imagine, not being able to eat has caused dramatic weight loss - 80 lbs and counting.  As of January of 2019, he and April have decided, along with his doctors to stop treatment and move to hospice.

It's uncertain exactly where the cancer came from, but it is now located in a mass by her lungs and in the linings around her heart and lungs. At this time, the cancer is inoperable, but she will begin treatment within the next few days at U of M hospital. Treatment will consist of both radiation and chemotherapy, some of which will begin right away in the hospital with the other stages beginning in the weeks to come. Tasha currently has stents in her chest to drain off the fluid from her heart and lungs. Those will remain until the build-up of the fluid stops.Tasha and hr husband, Glenn, just gave birth to their first baby (Ryder) in October. They live in the Saginaw area but have been at U of M in Ann Arbor for the last week undergoing testing and treatment. Glenn has already used up all of his available paid vacation time from work to be in the hospital supporting Tasha and taking care of Ryder. Since Glenn is unable to commute back and forth to work, and will be unable to do so for the foreseeable future, they no longer have a source of income.The money raised will go to help take care of the expenses related to Tasha's hospital stay and to take care of their living expenses. It is likely that Tasha's continued care will lead them to move to the Traverse City area, which will add to their upcoming expenses. Their insurance will cover most, if not all, of the hospital expenses, but they still need money for food, gas, rent, and other expenses until Glenn can get back to work or find new employment in the Traverse City area. We appreciate your prayers and donations.

Cancer won and battle but our love will win the war for this young family. Karun was blessed with  2 sweet kids, daughter (Gauri Batra, 8 years), son (Shoreya Batra, 4 years) and wife (Meenakshi Batra) . Karun, a doting father carved out a niche to make sure that he provided the best life for his kids in his best capacity. He was happily living with his family till Jan, 2018 when they came to know that Karun was diagnosed with a very rare, very aggressive, and very advanced (stage 4) form of blood cancer. Despite the financial hardships ,   Karun’s family didn’t lose hope and admitted him to best hospital of the city hoping he will get cured. The fighter Karun was, he fought with blood cancer for a year. After the initial chemotherapy sessions, doctors recommended Bone Marrow transplant, lot of tests & samples were done and Karun’s brave 8 year old daughter matched the bone marrow and came forward to save her father's life to donate her bone marrow.The cancer was very aggressive &  during the Bone Marrow transplant Karun developed a clot in the brain Karun went into coma.  Doctors put him on a ventilator, but he started sinking.  This Go Fund Me page is set up to  help offset the astronomical medical costs and to help out this young family in educating the kids and living expenses.   We are optimistic &  have set the  goal to $50,000 USD, if we exceed the goal, we will donate the funds to cancer research and patients who need funds for treatment.

To say Corey and Lisa are shocked is an understatement. Following the happy birth of Wyatt in October, they have been adjusting to their new life as a family of five with sisters Zoey and Nya, and this diagnosis has blindsided them. This particular type of cancer is usually diagnosed in people over the age of 60. Anyone who knows Corey knows he is extremely active and healthy, but cancer has never been known to discriminate. So now they are on the journey to crush this cancer and never let it come back!Corey had a PET scan the day before Thanksgiving that showed one small tumor in his neck and another medium (fist-sized) tumor in between his lungs. Surgery is not an option with this type of lymphoma. He started chemotherapy treatments the week after Thanksgiving, and will receive treatments every 21 days for the next 3-4 months. Corey had a few days of nausea and fatigue following the first round, but his energy is back up (at least as much as it can be with two toddlers and a newborn in the house!). He has been able to get in a few walks/hikes/workouts, which the doctor said will be an important part of his recovery. Corey and Lisa really like and trust their oncologist in Helena, but will be traveling to Seattle in a few weeks to meet with a team of lymphoma experts to ensure they are doing everything possible to crush this cancer on the first try. Corey has already reached his out-of-pocket maximum for insurance in 2018 and expects to reach the maximum in 2019 as well. The ongoing costs for treatment, travel, and other related expenses will quickly become a burden on the family.They are very grateful for their support network of family and friends. With a small donation, we can help relieve the financial stress of cancer and allow Corey to better focus on his treatment, recovery, and family. This fund is set up on behalf of Corey and Lisa, and all funds will go directly to them. Please send your positive thoughts, prayers, vibes and energy for a successful journey.

I have metastatic breast cancer which is Terminal. I am looking for assistance in realizing my goals and desires while I still have a body capable of doing so.BACKSTORY:Young, confident, in-love and successful. I worked hard and built a great life by the time I was 30 with no intention of slowing down. I would soon find out that I didn’t have a choice.I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in December 2016. A persistent pain in my side eventually led to my diagnosis. It was aggressive, so I had to make the ""decision"" to move forward with the recommendation of doctors.  During my first Mastectomy they removed a baseball size lump from my right breast along with 28 Lymph nodes. I then endured Chemotherapy and radiation where I lost my hair and self-confidence, followed by DIEP flap surgery. In this surgery they removed my left breast also and made 2 new breasts from the fat of my stomach. The entire ""treatment"" process was incredibly painful and emotionally devastating. Never the less, I had this shit!! Calm, collected and tough, my glass was still half full. I continued to sell real estate through the entire ordeal and managed to not only finish as one of the top sales people in my office but took home the title of “Best Realtor of the South Coast” for the second year in a row. I was so lucky (and still am) to have the support of the best clients, colleagues, friends and family in the whole world!! I can’t help but sob as I write this thinking about my family and what they must go through just because they love me. FUCK CANCER!!!!! (Please forgive the language, my husband is a sailor after all.)June 2018 my life is finally starting to take shape again. My hair is grown out enough so that I can style it. My energy is returning, and I am feeling well enough to start going to the gym again. I am preparing for our trip to Jamaica in October to get married (something that was postponed by the cancer) and I am looking forward to a long future with the love of my life by my side.Have you ever been slapped REALLY hard right across the face? This is how I felt when I noticed the lumps in my left breast. Upon investigation, the lumps appeared to be dead tissue from the last surgery I had to correct the shape of my left breast. During the investigation however, new images discovered lesions on bones. From my femur, up through my spine and on my skull. THIS is not good news, this means I no longer get to work towards a cure or even remission. The name of the game now is to try and keep the cancer from spreading further for as long as possible. With that lovely reassurance, I sought medical treatment at Cancer Treatment Center of America in Tulsa, OK. Unfortunately, the prognosis was the same at CTCA. They did offer me oral chemo, which I take daily, and provide an incredible healing environment full of amazing people who really care. (If you or anyone you know has cancer, I would highly recommend making the phone call to CTCA immediately and seeing if there are options for you.) WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE ME NOW?You can find me some days trying to cure cancer. Researching and learning about nutrition and trying to change my lifestyle to reflect what I learn: Food as medicine, Rick Simpson Oil, Meditation, positive affirmations, energy healing, vitamins, self-care, sacred roots and special teas. Other days I go to doctor appointments, work, visit my mother, walk the dog, run errands and do chores. Most days I fight depression, battle with anxiety, struggle with body image, ache with pain and toile over the meaning of life and what my purpose is. I am on a roller coaster that I cannot control. My mental state is a surprise to me each day and my body is failing me.It is a very fine line to walk between being positive and realistic. And while I am going to give my best shot at curing my cancer, I also do not want it to be too late for me to experience some of the incredible things this life has to offer. The reality is that my bones are weak, my body is pained and I’m capable of doing less and less all the time. I want to stare in awe at the natural wonders of the planet. I want to grow internally as I learn new things about life from other cultures. I want to meet new people and show someone less fortunate that kindness and love can come from a stranger. I want to make memories with my family and friends that they will never forget. And lastly, I want to travel with my husband and have all the experiences together that we were supposed to have over our next 50 years of marriage.Thankfully my savings and the contributions of the community and my family have kept me afloat over the last 2 years. I have spent tens of thousands of dollars on medical care and travelling for care and I owe tens of thousands more with no end in sight. I have accepted a lot of truths about my situation, but I refuse to accept that I don’t deserve the life experiences I have worked so hard to realize. If I don’t get to do these things soon, I may never have the chance. Please help me by sharing this far and wide. Maybe a well-off person will see my list and want me to experience something that they have cherished in their lifetime. Maybe a kind-hearted celebrity will support my quest for experiencing a full life in the short time I have left. Maybe, just maybe, I will get the opportunity to cross off my bucket list before the deadline that looms ahead of me.  Thank you SO MUCH for reading this and sharing.  JENNI'S BUCKET LISTTake my husband to DisneyworldCover my scars with a chest tattooSee my mother in a better homeComplete Cabin & Start a little farm w/garden & goats/chickensSave a life by donating my organsAttend an Ayahuasca ceremonySee Niagara FallsFly over a volcano with lavaSee some concerts where the artist puts on a great show like Beyoncé, Kanye west or lady gagaGo to Burning manSit behind the glass at a pro Hockey gameGo to Tomorrowland in BelgiumVisit throughout Europe: Paris Eiffel tower, Venice canalsAttend a full moon party in Thailand/see Vietnam and try BalutTahiti/Bora Bora- Stay in overwater bungalowCatch a big ass fishSkydiveIceland to see northern lights and go to Blue LagoonSee icebergs in GreenlandGo through Panama CanalThe Great Barrier Reef: Scuba diveSee the Pyramids of Giza, EgyptSee the architecture of DubaiYellowstone National ParkRoad trip east coast USA, see New YorkLearn SpanishRide in hot air balloonSwim with nurse sharks",651db5512c85cabd318fbca3a80e3347,54,0.51,4.0,1,1,breast cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

We live in Toronto, with my partner, Ravi, our youngest daughter, Uma, and my mother-in-law, Sudha. Tara is 18 and was taking a gap year to travel before starting university in Sept 2019. We had spent just over 6 months planning her trip which would have taken her to New Zealand, Thailand, Bali and Vietnam. She was working as a swim instructor and lifeguard and saving as much as she could to finance the trip. In late November, she got a travel vaccine shot and a week later became very ill. A number of blood tests kept coming back abnormal over the next few weeks, but no one knew why she was ill or what was happening with the blood work. Finally, a few days before she was to fly in January, she had a chest x-ray that showed a large mass. The trip has been called off, for now. Since then, we have been told it is a type of lymphoma - yet to be determined what type, but it is looking right now like Hodgkins. Regardless of the type, it is treatable, but it's going to be a long process. Most likely, it will be a full 6 months before she is well again. She will receive chemotherapy, and possibly radiation. Next week she is scheduled for a core biopsy, and after that we will know more about the treatment details. Because there is a fertility risk, she will be meeting to discuss egg harvesting and freezing before treatment. She wants to have children some day, and this will keep that possibility open. We are super fortunate to live in a place where most of the costs for treatment and for the fertility program are covered by public health care. There is also some private insurance, if needed. However, there are some things that are not covered and we are a low-income artist household. We would greatly appreciate any help that can be given. Funds raised will first go directly to the costs of medicines and tests that are not covered by insurance. Then to related costs, such as travel to and from the hospital, as well as to purchase things that will help Tara be more comfortable while receiving treatment; a wig and hats, as there will likely be hair loss, and a protective mask to prevent illness as her immune system will be weakened, acupuncture and massage treatments, possibly... a puppy (we are aware that a puppy will be more work for us, but it will also give Tara something to focus on besides being ill, and will also bring comfort). Finally, money will be set aside to cover the fees for keeping her eggs frozen until she is ready to have kids, and IVF.  If anything remains beyond that, it will go towards Tara's trip or university. She is most likely going to defer her placement in university for another year so that she can have some time to heal and then do the trip that she was supposed to be on right now. Please help if you are able. Even a small donation can be put towards some of these things and we are so thankful for any help!",732f7c2110597368665a5800922df5c0,26,0.936,7.0,4,0,lymphoma,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

I managed to scrape by though, and convinced myself I didn't need help. My parents have helped as much as they can, but this happened at a very difficult time for them, financially. Now, I had my 12th chemo session yesterday, and go back in 6 weeks to find out if this journey from hell is over.

I also owe the hospital $900+ ,as well as $150+ to my phone company, and various other bills I have fallen behind on.or medical bills I have received.

It all started with an unexpected visit to our pediatrician last Thursday afternoon. To then rushing to DHMC ER and that is where the story begins. Thursday night after being in the MRI we found out that our baby girl has a very large brain tumor with lots of swelling and they had her in the OR preparing for surgery to remove it. After what seemed like days we finally got news early Friday morning that she was out of surgery and she was stable. The surgeon informed us he was not able to remove it all, only about 75% as it was getting too risky so he stopped. Friday was the start of a very excruciating waiting game. The sample was sent out for pathology and we were told it could be up to 10 days before we knew what we were dealing with. Fortunately we only had to wait til Monday. Monday we were delivered the worst news possible, our baby girl has brain cancer. And to make matters even worse we were told that it is an extremely rare type and the most aggressive kind of cancer. The surgeons goal at this point was to go back in and remove as much of the tumor as possible and he truly hoped he could remove it all. The location of the tumor and the way it was attached had the surgeon deeply concerned. He wanted to be able to remove it all to give the next step a higher chance for success but also knew it was in an extremely risky location. Tuesday finally arrived and she was taken away for surgery and at this point we stopped breathing. It was a very long 9 hours til we got to see our baby girl again but it came with great news. The surgeon was able to successfully remove the rest of her tumor, and we could breathe again. Wednesday is here and now we play the waiting game again. We wait to find out from oncology her exact cancer type and how they are going to try attacking it.

He cares more about others and their happiness than anyone will ever understand. He’s the biggest NASCAR nut around, but  you would never have guessed it by looking at him. He has a crazy husky who he adores more than humans, and family and friends that would do anything in their power for him.  He loves photography and exploring and traveling anywhere that he can manage to get to. Alex has a love for cars and a very dedicated presence in the car community with his organization, Dub Empire. On August 2013 Alex was diagnosed with a rare pediatric bone cancer called Ewing’s Sarcoma, that was discovered in his right ankle. Shortly after finding out the diagnosis we learned that it had already spread to his lungs. Alex started intensive chemotherapy and radiation to his chest and right ankle on September of 2013- April 2014, completing 7 rounds. June 2015, Alex had a procedure, known as a wedge dissection, following more chemo and radiation. This was to remove the cancer in a small portion of the left lung while saving the remaining healthy lung areas.  After the treatments and procedures were complete, Alex’s scans came back clear. He was cancer free! The scans continued to be clear for roughly 2 years. August of 2017, the scan showed 3 small nodules were back in the left lung. With the support from family, Alex decided he wanted to try to do a clinical trial up in Virginia at the National Institute of Health. The trial that he was doing had success and the tumors were shrinking, but in January the scans were different. The tumors showed growth. They were no longer responding to the trial. While back home in Orlando one night, Alex ended up coughing up blood clots.  We immediately decided it was best to go to the emergency room. That is when he found out that the tumor was growing so much that it was causing a tear in the lung. Alex had a procedure done to patch the tear and stop the bleeding.Shortly after the repair procedure he tried a second trial back up in Virginia at NIH, but quickly it put his liver at dangerous levels. The medical team was concerned it would lead to liver failure. It was abruptly put to an end. Upon returning to Orlando we met with the Oncology team at UF Cancer Center in Orlando, where Alex was previously being treated. At that time the team decided it would be best to remove the tumor altogether. Unfortunately, due to the size of the tumor that meant removing the whole left lung. May of 2018, Alex underwent a left pneumectomy removing the lung and tumor.August of 2018, Alex had his follow up scans to make sure everything was clear after the surgery he underwent. There once again was a spot. A small amount was missed and it had begun to grow. Immediately once again he decided he wanted to undergo traditional inpatient chemotherapy.  Four cycles have been completed since then, but at the recommendation of the Oncologist at UF Cancer Center Orlando; Alex will soon be seeking a second opinion for further treatments. Alex is having difficulty working at this time.  The treatments have left him weak and in a lot of pain.   Despite all he is going through, he remains as upbeat as possible. Watching him go through this with such dignity is hard for his family members. He is a proud individual, so asking for assistance is hard for him, but the bills are piling up and he needs all of the support he can get.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼",caefead396613260bdd2c2d262605b45,38,0.3825,5.0,0,1,bone cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

He is also one of the kindest, most intelligent, charming and delightful people you could ever hope to meet. He is beloved by his many friends and students for his contagious enthusiasm and love of painting as well as his dedication to his students’ individual artistic development. Last year he was diagnosed with a stage 4 high-risk, aggressive form of prostate cancer. There were no warning signs, so as those of you who have been through this type of ordeal will understand, our world was flipped upside down. His prostate surgery was followed by two more surgeries to address complications, three blood transfusions and 3 weeks in intensive care. Once this ordeal was over, the healing process began for Patrick but the cancer reasserted itself in mid July. Things turned worrisome again. In September, he was placed on a new cancer protocol, in fact he was the first cancer patient at the Kimmel Cancer Center to be on this innovative therapy. By November he was responding positively, but the treatment has serious side-effects: soreness, limb pain, and the worst side-effect of all, chronic fatigue.
The good news is that he continues to respond positively to the therapies and medications. The cancer cells remain inactive; the downside is that the soreness, limb pain and the chronic fatigue intensified. It has limited Patrick’s time to teach and lecture. His painting, his lifetime passion, has also been limited. The loss of income over the past year, along with the growing medical bills not covered by insurance, has made it necessary for us to ask for help. Patrick works as much as possible, exercises regularly and intensely to combat the fatigue, and never loses faith he can continue to fight. We have 18 months more of treatment, including radiation, and I have no doubt that Patrick will carry on with the same grace and enthusiasm that is his nature. The slogan we have adopted at our house is to be “cautiously optimistic and aggressively positive.” The outpouring of love and support from our families, friends, and neighbors and, of course, from his Cancer Team at Kimmel Cancer Center, has been an enormous blessing. While it is stressful and difficult to ask for financial help, we find ourselves falling behind. Every little bit helps. Please donate.

Sometimes ignorance is bliss as we did not know at the time just how devastating ovarian cancer actually is. Celeste had lost two friends to this deadly disease but didn't know just how scary the diagnosis was because just the word cancer in itself is such a traumatic diagnosis. One is never prepared for it especially when no one in her immediate family had ever had ovarian cancer to her knowledge. In a recemt book called ""Memoir of a Debulked Woman: Enduring Ovarian Cancer,"" the author, Susan Gubar writies, ""There are many forms of cancer that offer a lot of hope but not this one.""  And further she goes on to say that there were 21,550 new cases of ovarian cancer in the US in 2009 and there were an additional 14,600 women who died from it. [In the UK, 6,500 women are diagnosed with the disease every year, and 4,400 die each year]. It used to be estimated that one out of 70 American women would get the disease, the deadliest of all gynaecological cancers, though recently the number sometimes cited is one in 55. There are very few published personal accounts for them to consult, since for decades, indeed for centuries, women have generally maintained silence about the silent killer.""  Like the author above, Celeste underwent surgery which in her case was an 8 hour surgery, which included  blood transfusions.  She then completed 6 rounds of chemotherapy which we know is a controversial and extremely toxic course of therapy that last 10 hours each time it was administered. Because there is so little hope offered by mainstream medicine, Celeste has diligently explored supportive treatments from the alternative medical community which we both believe is a must for everyone to do.  Although Celeste has good insurance there is so much that is not covered and that includes a very special therapy that is at this time to be considered state of the art (more about this in a moment) and therefore I am asking for your help financially to help us pay the cost of this treatments since insurance won't. It is our hope for Celeste that she can beat the horrendous odds she is up against with ovarian cancer, which reocurrs more often than not as she wants so very much to get back to what she loves doing best and that is helping other people in any way she can.If you need to refresh your memory who Celeste is, you may remember her as a talented actress, who co-starred with Elvis Presley in the film ""Live a Little Love a Little."" Many people also remember Celeste for having been the last elected Miss Rheingold back in 1964 where she garnered 20,000,000 votes to be the spokesperson for an Eastern Seabord Brewery called Rheingold. It was an advertising legend that the Mad Men of the day dreamed up to sell beer and Celeste was the 25th Miss Rheingold. Many notable actresses got there start with this contest  but you may need to ask your grandparents about it if they lived in the  area.Besides have been being a model, spokesperson and actress and has been a part of 'show business' all her life Celeste is a devoted mother and grandmother who has spent her life in the service of others, through her work as a Holistic animal advocate and author.   Below are the covers of her two latest books for pets which she co-authors with her writing partner and dear friend Jean Hofve DVM.Most recently Celeste was one of the producers on a documentary film entitled, ""Femme Women Healing the World,"" where she also appears with 100 women from around the world as a spokesperson.  She loves empowering women and sharing the importance of gender equality, through her speaking, writing, producing and personal appearances . Celeste was so excited to be part of ""Femme,"" because it gave her the opportunity to share the importance of partnership with ones gender of choice, to help our world move forward to peace at last.  She was very excited about the future and wanted and still hopes to continue to be a part of conscious film making. However, on that fateful day, November 21, 2014 our world and plans were shattered as she faced all that would be in store for her for the forseeable future  right before the Thanksgiving holiday. Celeste had gone to her gynocologist for a pretty routine visit to discuss what she thought were some symptoms that seemed minor and couldn't believe what was to follow after being so healthy and after being devoted to holistic health care and wellness all her life. Bravely, she was steadfast and underwent that emergency surgery. We were blessed that Celeste had this amazing and excellent surgeon and surgical team to  operate on her.  It was like a miracle that one of the best women's cancer surgeons was available at our local hospital.On November 25th, I waited for nearly 10 hours with Celeste's daughter and son- in- law to finally get the good news that the surgery was a success but far more complicated than expected. Her surgeon removed 10 pounds of cancerous fluid from her peritoneal area,  along with performing two bowel resections and a complete hysterectory.  He debulked the peritoneum as well getting rid of all the cancerous tumors.After 4 grueling weeks in the hospital along and enduring a huge dose of antibiotics for an infection at the surgery site,  living with all the drains and tubes and minor additional surgeries, she was finally released in time for Christmas with the family and me. Our prayers had come true, our beloved Celeste was able to open presents with the family by the beautiful tree her daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter had decorated . She went through all this like a champ and is grateful to be alive and have the support of  her loving friends, fans and family.  The chemotherapy with all the side effects that come with it followed the surgery and this was rough on Celeste however with the help of  holistic modalities which she does each day as she needed to build up her strength and her immune system.  We didn't realize how chemo demolshes the cancer patients immune system rendering the person vulnerable to every germ out there. Because we didn 't know how serious this could be, Celeste didn't want to miss out on speaking at her favorite conference and thus sje made an appearance at the Conscious Life Expo in February 2015 the LAX Hilston. Because her immune system, unbeknownst to us was so weak she caught a horrific flu bug, which went into bronchitis and she landed back in the hospital. We now know all to well that when you go through chemo it truly wipes out your white blood cell count and with this bug she had become what is called neutropoenic. Celeste needed to be put in isolation at the hopsital and all the nurses were masked, gowned and gloved when they entered her room. Her coughing was so severe she got a very large hernia internally below her new surgical incision. This is called an incisional hernia. Like all hospital stays Celeste expressed that she was getting worse being there but was finally released to continue healing at home but still had to complete the rest of her chemo rounds for a total of 6. And chemo just makes everything take forever to heal. Celeste bravely faced the struggle to move forward and together she and I went into full on survival mode. 


Celeste completed all 6 rounds of those grueling rounds of chemo however Celeste she need to face another surgery on July 24th 2015.  Her PET and CAT scans  thankfully did not show any evidence of cancer however it detected two blood clots (DVTs) which required placement surgically of an IVC filter in her Vena Cava vein to prevent the migration of the clots during surgery when she would not be able to have her daily very painful Lovinox blood thinning injections which is pretty routine now during hospital stays and also for DVTs. Celeste had this repair surgery which also revealed what is called a lymphocyst the size of cantaloup, this was removed by a wonderful surgeon, then a second amazing surgeon stepped into repair her huge incisional hernia using polypropylene mesh to repair it and then a third surgeon stepped into to close and repair the damage that all this had done to her abdomen. Keep in mind this was a secon opening for the very same incision that was done in November for the first cancer surgery.Celeste's first surgeon being a man of vision who does not simply accept the standard of care,  had the foresight the night before that first surgery to ask if we could come up with a very large sum of money to store the tumor tissue at a facility called storemytumor.com as he would  be removing that tissue for future use and we, having no idea how we would come up with that money  simply said yes to what the universe might have in store for Celeste.This tumor storage was prepared and banked for later use for a special personalize medical protocol at a facility off shore in the Grand Cayman Islands called PerseusPCI . You may have seen lately in the news perhaps on 60 Minutes some of the exciting things that are being done in personalized cancer therapy and then of course the treatment former President Jimmy Carter had.  This new personalized immuno-therapy involves a series of 4 injections which have been  made for Celeste from this stored tumor tissue and her own blood.  Celeste and I traveled to the Cayman's this past December 2015 to make her vaccines and receive the first in the series which are done intradermally..just under the skin on top of each thigh. Upon arrival they review your blood work, give you a Nupagen shot to boost your white count and then go to work in their state of the art FDA lab to make the series of special vaccines only for Celeste. There are no other ingredients like you hear about being used in traditional vaccines. Here only ones own biological material is used and this is unique to PerseusPCI's patented delivery sustem.  Again insurance doesn't cover any of these costs and it is a cost that must be incurred. The percentage of people surviving past 5 years who just do chemo and surgery are only about 2% and this new treatment option is our hope in extending Celeste's life expectancy.  Here is a bit more information for your perusal in case you or a loved one would like to also explore this option:What is a cancer vaccine and personal cancer immune therapy? ""A cancer vaccine is designed to awaken the immune system and activate it to fight the cancer from within. The patient’s own tumor is used to vaccinate the patient making each vaccine personalized. These treatments are experimental, extend the patient’s time in remission, and have relatively no side effects."" The cost of this treatment alone has eaten up all that has been raised by the fund thus far as prepayment is required at the onset of treatment and we must travel back and forth to the Caymen's every 30 to 45 days for a total of the first four vaccines and then there will be two boosters at 3 month and 6 months. See  http://www.perseusPCI.com for more on the treatment protocol Celeste is doing presently for immunotherapy in the Cayman's.Of course,  Celeste is utilizing all the holistic and alternative options you would expect someone with her knowledge to do such with advanced neutraceuticals, CBD Rich Hemp Oil, Moxxor Omega 3, special arromatherapyl oils and an advanced cancer protocol with state of the art supplements, but as most of you know insurance doesn't cover any of these protocols and treatment options.Here is a bit more about Celeste's career""Live Long and Prosper!Celeste, besides co-starring with Elvis was also in many other films and TV shows but she is still well known for having been on the original Star Trek series in the classic episode entitled, ""The Apple."" Celeste has bravely trekked through the taxing medical reality of ovarian cancer treament, healed from the 6 rounds of chemo,  survived the stress of the extreme costs of her care,  much of it, as I mentioned is not covered by her insurance.  Celeste wants very much to see everyone again at autograph and media shows in the future and we have even made a trip to Germany together this past March for a wonderful Elvis event in Bayreuth Germany. We also were able thankfully to attend the STARCON/STICCON convention in Bellaria Italy to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Star Trek with none other than Bill Shartner, Captain Kirk himself. Her professional travels thankfully included all expenses being paid for us to attend.Celeste's  writing career as many of you know has been devoted to the service of people and animals,  and supporting causes to make this world a better place. This she does through her work in television, film, books, speaking engagements and all things wellness and anti-aging, for which she has been a tireless advocate all her life. Being struck by this thunderbolt in Celeste's 70th year has been huge and has led to major upheavals within our lives. Any financial support, even of $5 at this time is very much appreciated and tremendously beneficial in aiding her recovery, helping her get these amazing treatments in the Grand Cayman Islands where just the travel costs itself are astronomical is so very needed as she wants very much to continue to be of value to others. We send our love and thanks to all who can help her at this critical time. Please share this site with others as the symptoms of  the hard to detect ovarian cancer are listed here in several of her updates.  Celeste wants all women to be vigilent and not neglect any symptoms that seem suspicious. Ovarian cancer is very sneaky and standard diagnostics don't catch it soon enough. Celeste works tirelessly at her Facebook group page called Holistic Cancer Care and you may request to join and feel free to share it with others. Celeste hopes to do a book for women on Holistic Cancer Care and share what has worked so well for her thus far to get her into remission. Do keep in mind that we can't ever say that cancer is cured but we can say there is no evidence of disease and the purpose of immunotherapy is to prevent reaccurences. Celeste needs to build up her strength as she had a set back with an infection and was hospitalized again over the 2015 Christmas holiday however she  recovered beautifully but a chronic condition of bone on bone degenerative hip disease was exacerbated to such a degree we must now explore hip replacements for her as walking and standing have become so painful and difficult for her.In 2017 Celeste experienced a recurrence which they caught early and needed a second series of 6 rounds of chemo, this time with Doxil and the Carboplatin again. CBD Rich Hemp Oil helped her to not take the drugs for nausea and pain however insurance doesn't pay for this and it is several hundred per month.Celeste completed the 6 rounds over 6 months from spring of 2017 to November on the Carboplatin and Doxil and all looked great. CA125 was normal, CT scan looked good but the following month, December, 2017 everything started to look like another recurrence was taking place as the CA125 starting going up and up. Celeste received in January 2018 and again in April her two and final immunotherapy boosters from PerseusPCI which did not work at all this time as we got the devastating news on the May CT scan that the ovarian cancer came back again in the peritoneum but also hit a lot of lymph nodes and spread to her lungs, and two other places. They still even though the cancer moves to other places still call it ovarian cancer. Celeste's oncologist put her on a new drug called a PARP Inhibitor (Lynparaza) for 3 months at the beginning of 2018 and this too did not work as her CA125 started to soar and this was not good and very scary. So she was put on a daily low dose chemo pill which she takes each night and then we go into Cedars every two weeks for an IV infusion called Avastin which is an anti-angiogenesis drug meaning it targets the vessels that help to feed cancer! The CA125 came down after 4 weeks and has dropped since then but no where near the normal range but at least so far it has not gone up but Celeste developed a horrendous cough in May of 2018 with bronchial and diaphramatic spasms that after 4 months of various holistic and  allopathicmedical treatments have not made it to go away...no infection, just the nasty cancer making it feel like she needs to cough something up and there is phlegm but the cough just won't stop. She has seen many doctors both traditional such as a wonderful new integrative physician, a naturopath who supports the Western medical options and side effects with holistic things and a new fantastic pulmonologist...however, so far nothing has helped and she is very worn down and worn out and also short of breath. But she and I both remain positive and optimistic that something will work soon and she will be feeling well again. For now...we do the best we can!  Celeste and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your love, compassion, prayers and support...we couldn't have gotten this far without each and everyone of you and we do consider this fund to be an answer to a prayer to simply stay alive and live another day.Please share this page with others of course because we so need your help but also because we hope that what we share here will help others, too.Most Gratefully,NazimPlease visit Celeste's business website as she loves  to pay the things that she has found to be helpful forward. http://www.artofwellness.bemergroup.com",b4045d3335d160297db31f4d59363252,86,0.9724545454545455,1440.0,1,1,general,0,1,0,1,0,0.0003190810465858328,0.0,0.5962328767123287,1.0,0.0,gofundme

Although this was a huge life change, the initial prognosis was great, and she was told that thanks to advanced research in the field, most patients who take these daily oral treatments live a relatively normal life. A year has now passed and my sister has been unable to tolerate the TKI treatments due to a haematological intolerance, regardless of multiple dose changes and reductions.  She has been told that she will now need to have a Bone Marrow transplant in order to survive. The Bone Marrow transplant will require high-dose Chemotherapy and radiation in order to kill her existing bone marrow in preparation for the transplant. The procedure will see her in the hospital for approximately 4-8 weeks, and she will need 3-12 months of recovery time to be back to her normal self.There are many risks associated with this procedure, including a high risk of Infection from low immune system, and rejection of the transplant. She will also no longer be able to have children, and will need to preserve her fertility. She has been lucky enough to locate a donor match for this procedure, and is beginning consultations and transplant classes next week to prepare for this life-changing procedure.  My sister is incredibly talented, funny, loving and the kindest woman you will meet.

Yo la conozco. He visto su increíble perseverancia al buscar trabajo, su pasión casi obstinada para aprender inglés (créanme, no hablaba una sola palabra) y la descomunal energía que tiene para lavar platos hasta altas horas de la madrugada, sabiendo que en pocas horas debe levantarse de nuevo a estudiar. Mari es fuerte, pero para enfrentar este reto necesita un poco de ayuda. Un pequeño empujón, no es más. Los médicos acaban de diagnosticarla con “carcinoma papilar de tiroides”, y según el dictamen está en Categoría VI, lo que quiere decir que tiene alto grado de malignidad y el procedimiento a seguir de acuerdo con los médicos, sería la remoción quirúrgica.Así es, estamos luchando contra el tiempo.Mari debe someterse a una cirugía llamada TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY + CENTRAL NECK DISSECTION lo antes posible, pues en este punto de la historia cada minuto, literalmente, es vital.Nunca, en ningún momento de nuestro viaje a Australia, esperamos vernos enfrentados a un reto como este (venimos a pasarlo bien ¿no?). Pero los problemas llegan y hay que ponerles el pecho; claro está, hacerlo es mucho más fácil si contamos con apoyo.Maricel dice todo el tiempo que su mayor preocupación es estar sola en este país, y necesitamos la ayuda de todos ustedes para demostrarle que no es así; que aunque su mamá está lejos, en Australia tiene una familia inmensa que está dispuesta a hacer lo que sea necesario para salvarle la vida. Hemos creado este fondo para ayudarle a costear los gastos de su tratamiento; pues aunque afortunadamente el seguro médico cubre el valor de la cirugía, Mari no puede volver a trabajar durante los próximos dos meses, lo que implica que no tendrá dinero para cubrir los gastos durante su proceso de recuperación (consultas médicas, medicinas, vivienda y alimentación).Básicamente queremos quitarle a Mari la preocupación de no tener trabajo en Australia (todos sabemos lo que significa eso), durante sus dos meses de convalecencia. ¡Queremos que se concentre en recuperarse!Si además del apoyo económico, tienes alguna otra forma de ayudarnos a que Mari supere esta dura prueba, te estaremos eternamente agradecidos.-----Mari’s story began just like anyone else who has come to this country, facing her fears and taking on new challenges to grow as a person. Nevertheless, Australia has been tougher on Mari than on most of us, and today she is facing what is perhaps the biggest challenge that anyone could ever face on this journey: a fight against cancer. But Mari is strong! I know her. I’ve seen her incredible determination at finding a job, her dogged passion to learn English (believe me, she couldn’t speak a word when she arrived) and the colossal energy she’s got for washing plates until even the wee hours of the morning, knowing that in just a few hours she would have to get up all over again to study. Mary is strong, but to face this challenge she needs a bit of help. Just a leg up, nothing more. Doctors have recently diagnosed her with papillary thyroid carcinoma, classified at stage 6, meaning it has a high degree of malignancy and that doctors have recommended surgical removal. Indeed, we are in a race against time. Mari must undergo an operation known as TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY + CENTRAL NECK DISSECTION as soon as possible. This late in the game, every minute, literally, is vital. Never, at any moment of our journey in Australia, do we ever expect to find ourselves staring down such a challenge (we’ve all come to have fun, right?). But problems pop up, and we have to give them all we’ve got. If anything’s clear, it’s that doing that is a lot easier when we have people to fall back on. Maricel always says that her biggest worry is being alone in this country, and we need the support of each and every one of you to show her that this isn’t the case; that although she may be far from home, in Australia she has a family that is willing to do whatever it takes to save her life. We have created this fund to help cover the costs of her treatment, since although her medical insurance fortunately covers the cost of the surgery, Mari will be unable to return to work for the following two months, meaning she will lack the money needed to cover her costs during the recovery process (medical appointments, medications, rent and food). Basically, we want to free Mari from the stress of not having a job in Australia (we all know what that’s like) during her two months of recuperation. We want her to focus on getting better! If, beyond just financial support, you have any other way to help Mari along through this difficult test, we will be eternally grateful.",33118ec40abf957bff83f172c0b2974c,27,0.4385,7.0,4,0,general,0,1,0,1,0,0.0011299435028248588,0.0,0.5732647814910026,1.0,0.0,gofundme

And we are just going to be spreading joy and celebrating Harrison and his amazing life.” And those words are the truest ever written. Right from his mommas heart! Like Missy said, as of this afternoon, Harrison will be at home, with hospice care making him comfortable here on out. Because of that, Missy will be taking an unpaid leave to care for, and spend time with Harrison. As a community, our job is to rally around the Pluta's - to love and serve them however we know how to.  Sometimes, in situations like this, we have no idea what to do, how to help, how to love, and how to serve. There isn't an outline for how to do things like this. But the Word says that we are blessed to be a blessing. That it is far better to give than to receive. that as Christians and people who want to love, our job is to carry each others burdens. (Galatians 6:2) As Harrison, and the Pluta’s community, we wanted to create an easy outlet for you to do that. Because of the accumulating medical bills, unforeseen expenses, and Missy taking an unpaid leave from work to be Harrison’s primary care giver, one of the many and most practical ways we can lift a burden from the Pluta’s is a financial gift. The Pluta’s thank you. Our community thank's you. And I know God is grinning as He watches His people come together to love the son, and family that He loves so much. Let’s love the heck out of them!",e0f72cbcf3ce5de4fbf767e5a89fe9c6,26,1.1915,150.0,1,1,general,1,3,1,3,1,0.007125890736342043,0.0023752969121140144,0.03165137614678899,5.565910697987402,1.0,gofundme

In February of 2012, I was first diagnosed with stage 3-breast cancer at age 25. The treatment I received shortly after that diagnosis was 8 rounds of chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, 33 radiation treatments, and 25 hyperbaric oxygen treatments (because I had a really hard time healing after all of the treatments I had already gone through). Days before my double mastectomy I got married to my husband Wesley. It was one of the best days of my life and I thank God for him daily. Then, in July of 2013, I had breast reconstruction surgery. I had a hard time healing after that and spent 5 days in the hospital on high dose antibiotic. I was on hormone suppression therapy for almost 4 years. I had really awful side effects from those and got off of them in July of 2015. At the time I was diagnosed, I was on active duty in the US Air Force and thankfully my insurance covered all of these treatments and medicines. I have since been medically retired from the Air Force. In May of 2014, I moved back to MI to be near family. On March 4, 2016, I found out I was 5 weeks pregnant. What a miracle it was because I was told it would be VERY difficult to have a baby after all of my cancer treatment. BUT, God knew how much I desired to be a mommy and he gave my husband and me that gift on Oct. 21, 2016 when our beautiful, healthy baby boy was born. I thank God for my son Jackson everyday who is now 10 months old. Since having Jackson I just haven't felt well. In just the last few months it got worse and I started getting a rash with bumps on my right breast/chest that never went away among other health problems. I went to the dermatologist at the beginning of August 2017 and they biopsied 2 spots and it came back positive for recurrence/metastatic breast cancer. In the last few weeks I've had many tests done (scans, blood work and a liver biopsy). It turns out that the breast cancer is stage 4 and has spread to my skin (in the area where my original tumor was and the skin around it on my chest), and to both of my lungs and liver. After weeks of prayer, research and discussions with my husband and doctors I have decided that I want to use alternative cancer treatments in addition to some conventional treatments to fight this second battle with breast cancer. The first time around I used mostly conventional treatments and it wiped out my immune system and I have experienced many health problems since. I want to fight cancer differently this time and have a better chance at having quality of life. With that being said my insurance will not cover anything that isn't standard of care and will not be covering any of the integrative/alternative treatments that I will be using. I will be having surgery Sept. 1, 2017 to have my implants removed (which have been an issue since day one in my body and have caused a lot of pain in discomfort in the last 4 years) and I will be having a hysterectomy (that has been recommended by doctors because my cancer is ER/PR+/HER-) and they want to put me in menopause so I will have a better chance at fighting this hormone positive breast cancer. Insurance should cover most of this but not all of it. If you feel led to donate to my healthcare fund please do.  If you are unable to, that's okay too. I'll happily accept your love through prayers. Your prayers and support are very much appreciated. If you want to know more please contact me via Facebook or e-mail and I will get back to you as soon as I can. God got me through cancer the first time 5 years ago and I know that He will guide me through it this time. I have my fears about my son Jackson growing up without a mommy but my faith is stronger than my fear. And I have to submit my life to God’s plans and His will. I will not let fear keep me from following God, for I know that he will always love me and never leave me. I knew this day could come and cancer “could” viciously return to reek havoc in my body again I just didn’t think it would be right now. However, it is my hope that God uses this trial to impact the lives of people around me. “The LORD is my light and my salvation— whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life— of whom shall I be afraid?” Psalm 27:1Thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart.Here are a few links to some videos that were made the first time that I battled cancer... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocz5NlreN5c&t=9s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tyxWCCK-uA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApP33GCrbcSpaceCoast Living Magazine Article:  http://spacecoastliving.com/survivor-a-call-for-camaraderie/",fc5fbefedefbc5e7dfc1ad38791e6284,40,0.77925,510.0,5,1,breast cancer,0,5,0,4,0,0.005636978579481398,0.0,0.49068860978778694,8.324636231021431,0.0,gofundme

It receives less funding leaving children — and their families — desperate to find experimental treatments that insurance companies won’t pay for. DIPG is viewed as an orphan disease because it has not been adopted by the pharmaceutical industry due to little financial incentives for the private sector to make or market medications to treat it.The treatment for DIPG has not changed in more than 50 years. Astronaut Neil Armstrong lost his young daughter, Karen, to DIPG in 1962, protocols for treatment and life expectancy had not changed since that time.In February 2018, our 12 year old daughter Josephine was complaining of double-vision and began losing her balance. We brought her to the eye doctor who immediately sent us to the emergency room. That emergency trip to the hospital forever changed our lives as Josephine was quickly diagnosed with a brain cancerous tumor called DIPG that the doctors have determined is impacting her nervous system and it’s lethal. ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Since that fateful day in February, we have been visiting different doctors and hospitals desperately trying to find care that will help Josephine while we struggle to find a balance between treatment options and quality of life. We are praying that while she is fighting, a medical breakthrough will happen and Josephine will be able to quickly go back to being a normal 12 year old girl. But the cold reality of a brain tumor is weighing heavily on our hearts as our child has the fight of her life ahead of her.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼We had daily trips from New Jersey to New York City to hospital for appointments, treatments, physical therapy, MRIs, surgery, biopsies, medicine, and radiotherapy. We now have monthly trips to Monterrey, Mexico for intra arterial chemotherapy not available in the U.S. Taking pride in always being able to care for our children ourselves makes it very difficult to ask for help, but we are in a situation where every bit helps so we must ask. The monthly intra arterial chemotherapy costs not covered by insurance are beyond our means. As of June 1, 2018, promising treatments such as CART T cell therapy and TOCA 5 among other form of treatments are still work in progress…The new law “right to try” that just passed only addresses FDA approval of drugs not procedures….As of July 1, 2018, a genetically modified poliovirus therapy developed at Duke Cancer Institute shows no sign of clinical trials for DIPG pediatric tumors...In fact, study participants of prior trials were selected according to strict guidelines based on the size of their recurring tumor, and  its location in the brain.  A tumor by the pons is not a location they would even consider at this point....Monterrey, Mexico offers intra-­arterial chemotherapy which consists in delivering chemotherapy in a highly selective way, infusing the drugs directly on the arteries that feed the tumor. This procedures are supplemented later on with immunotherapy. The cost of these procedures ranges from $15,000 to $33,000 per infusion depending on the combination of the procedures. The number of treatments depends on every patient's response, but the frequency ranges between 8 to 12 treatments the first year. Josephine ‘s first intra arterial chemotherapy took place 8/13/18 and we are coming back every four weeks afterward.....we are currently spending $22,000 monthly in these treatments since August 2018. These expenses are adding up......Any contributions provided will go toward Josephine’s medical expenses and care.

I seemed to be in good health. In July, I hurt my back. My pain never went away, it just became increasingly worse, and I was worried. I had given up my health insurance because of the cost. Lesson to learn: no matter what, you MUST have health insurance!I finally went for an xray at the beginning of this month. After seeing something concerning,  the doc suggested I go see an oncologist. An MRI was done.  Bad news. 4th Stage Lung Cancer that metastasized to my spine and several lymph nodes.  A mass has grown 2 1/2 inches and fractured my vertebrae. Which, in turn, pinched the sciatic nerve. Hearing that I have 6 months to 1yr to live (without treatment) is a surreal thought to grasp. The pain was so intense I couldn't move for hours after waking up. But I love baseball, and working with the Astros so much that I would drag myself to every game. I kept this pain to myself because I didn't want my Astros family to be concerned about anything but winning another World Series. I also continued working the Texan games. I told the rodeo folks- My sweet friend Ida Nuncio and the big boss James Davidson because I knew I wouldn't be able to do any lifting. I finally told Rob Runnels at the Astros. They worked with me for help. The pain was so excruciating this Friday I had to be admmitted into the hospital. I had a CT scan and even more bad news. My spine can't be fixed by surgery . Now I wait for a biopsy to see where it started and if there's any possible course of treatment. I’m trying to get into MD Anderson. There’s some chance I’ll have insurance in January, but I really don’t know. God willing. Of course, I'm hoping for the best. I have a friend that has lived through 4th stage lung cancer for 10 yrs now, and I hold onto that hope. I have my God. I made peace with my Lord. As a Catholic, I went to confession to be absolved of my sins. I don't want to die, but I'm not afraid to. I know I will go to Heaven. I've always tried to live a good life and to be positive. This will be a hard road. I saw it first hand with my brother, a fireman at 911,  who died of lung cancer 12 yrs later. It's very sad, and I'm emotional here, late at night with the thought of my death running through my brain. My sweetheart of sweethearts has been helping me just by caring. Cynthia Migl, my Bubbles, has been one of a group of angels. BoBo Raley Morgan McKay. my sister Deb Green, Heidi Clark, Robyn Nygard, Rob Garcia, my family, my ex- the greatest ex! Tracy Lapierre and her husband Tony. Vince King, Brittany King, Tammy Mayfield a nurse who drove from Dallas to be with me to hear the news from the Oncologist, David Hicks, Linda Gajdousek Joyce... and my greatest angel, Jo Stone who guided me in this direction. I love everyone with all my heart, and I hope at some time in our times together, I’ve touched your heart and soul. Because love and faith is all we have. Dad always said MEMORIES ARE THE ONLY THING YOU CAN LEAVE FOR LOVED ONES LEFT BEHIND. I know this is long as I spill my late night thoughts of life and love,  but I do love you all, and I plan to fight this cancer. Just keep praying. Feel free to call or ask questions. It's day to day, but my big goal this year is to make it to my 30th year of working for the Houston Astros. God loves me. He's not punishing me. Prayers for me please.

It started as a love story between Diana and myself, but now has grown to include 2 others - our 2 young daughters. First let me introduce myself, My name is Marc Godfrey. My wife is Diana. We have 2 daughters - Angelina, who is 3 years old and our latest bundle of joy - Attalia, who is 9 weeks old. In 2014, Diana was diagnosed with Breast Cancer when she was 36 years old. She had surgery on her breast to remove the cancer. The good news at that time was that the cancer was contained. All her lymph nodes were negative and the cancer had not spread anywhere else. She was advised to start Radiation treatments after her surgery which she did. She had completed perhaps half of her radiation treatments when we found out that Diana was pregnant. Obviously we were not planning on this to happen and now this created a dilemma for us. Diana could not continue with her cancer treatments if she was pregnant as there was too much risk of the treatments harming the baby growing inside her. Diana was advised by several of her doctors that she should terminate her pregnancy so she could continue her cancer treatments. This was not an easy choice for Diana to make. She believed that the baby's life that was growing inside her was just as precious as her life. How can I terminate this life she asked me tearfully? So together we made the choice that Diana would continue with the pregnancy and that we would stop the cancer treatments therefore giving this new life the chance that it deserved.On October 18, 2015, Diana delivered our 2nd Daughter. We named her Attalia (named similar to Diana's Grandfather Attilio who passed away last February) Attalia was a beautiful, healthy baby girl. Angelina our older daughter was in love with her baby sister. She wanted to always hold her and smother her with kisses. She couldn't believe she had her own live baby doll. Life seemed to be so good for us. We were both so happy. The children were healthy. Diana was feeing great. She had a follow-up with her cancer Dr. last month who advised Diana that now that she had delivered the baby - we need to have a CAT scan to check her status and see how she's doing. Diana told her - Everything is fine. I've been eating really healthy, juicing, and I have never felt better in my life. Her Dr told her - this is just routine Diana.Well last week Diana's doctor called. And that is when our world came crashing down. She said I have bad news to tell you and I know it is one week before Christmas, but I don't feel that this can wait. The CAT scan she said showed that the cancer is Stage 4 and has spread to both of Diana's lungs and also to the bones in her pelvis and hip. We were devastated. Crying. Shocked. We never expected to get this type of report. However, when we look at our new baby daughter Attalia, we know without a doubt that we made the right choice to continue Diana's pregnancy. She is a gift from God. As Diana's husband, I am trying to be strong too but it is difficult. Diana is the rock of our family. She is the one that holds everything together. She is an amazing mother to our daughters. I cannot imagine our life without her.We are in the process of trying to secure the best care and treatment possible for Diana so she can fight this dreadful disease. We know that we are in for the fight of her life. It is going to be expensive and cost money that we do not have. Diana will not be able to work and her loss of income will affect our family as well. We are asking friends, family members, co-workers, acquaintances and even strangers who read our story and are impacted by it to help us. Whatever you feel you could comfortably contribute be it $10.00, $ 50.00, $ 100.00 $ 1000.00 or more. Any amount would be greatly appreciated and would help us tremendously. We also would ask you to pray for us - both as a family and for Diana specifically that she will beat this disease. God has the power to grant a miracle and that is what we are praying for. Angelina and Attalia need to have their mother and I need to have my wife by my side. Thank you for taking the time to read our story. I will post updates with regards to Diana's treatment and progress so check back on our page.Psalm 30:2 - Lord my God, I called to you for help and you heard me.Love, Marc, Diana and Family",d0197a164a4dc13d6f7586e8815674c6,55,0.92742,1110.0,1,1,breast cancer,0,3,0,2,0,0.003605769230769231,0.0,0.7572347266881029,3.727968671837326,0.0,gofundme

Although this is the case, we have come to find providers that can avoid removing her eye, while providing a cure.  This cancer only occurs at a rate of 0.4 per million, with the majority of cases documented being in the middle east.  Oncologists are not even taught about it in med school because they will likely never encounter it.We have found a team of doctors with much experience with her cancer in Pittsburgh, PA.  Her big surgery to remove the tumor is scheduled on Wednesday, November 21st, 2018.  We anticipate 1 day in the ICU, followed by 4-5 more days in the hospital.  She will then come home to heal for 4-6 weeks before radiation begins.Any finacial assistance you can offer (even $5.00) will be most appreciated! The bills are already overwhelming.  Any money collected will be used for her medical treatment.  If there is extra we would appreciate to be able to use it for food and travel when we must be out of town for her care.Miranda has signed up to be part of a 5 year research study to add to the limited information available regarding this cancer.  We truely hope this can help others in the future.Thank you so much for reading our story.  Please post it to your social media and share with your friends and family!  EVERY little bit helps and this only works if it is shared! https://www.gofundme.com/support-miranda-kings-cancer-fund&rcid=r01-154222529296-b3bea24919b641cf&pc=ot_co_campmgmt_w",10f13ad7df46b28fe5cca2dfaa6a860b,21,0.30218,60.0,2,1,neuroblastoma,0,0,1,0,1,0.0,0.001941747572815534,0.4370860927152318,0.0,1.0,gofundme

A few years later, another devastating challenge came when Katie (the second child) was diagnosed with bone cancer of the lower jaw at the young age of 12.  Soon afterwards, Becky (the youngest) was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 13. Then a few years after that, Tessie (the eldest child) was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 20. One year after Tessie's treatment, Katie (then 19) was diagnosed with breast cancer, and in 2016 was diagnosed with colon cancer that had metastasized to her ovary. This year, both Tessie and Becky were also diagnosed with new cancers – Tessie was diagnosed with bone cancer in her upper jaw, while Becky was diagnosed with bone cancer in her ribs.             When their dad Paul was alive, he was an editor, writer, owner, and distributor of the Wednesday Magazine in Kitsap County, Washington for many years until his final days.  Beth, mother and wife, helped Paul run their business which she continued to manage after Paul’s passing. However, when the children were diagnosed with cancer, Beth could no longer keep the business running full-time by herself so she had to close it and pursue part-time employment. Over the years, Beth worked tirelessly juggling her schedule between jobs to sustain their family’s financial needs while tending to her three children who, at times, were undergoing surgeries and treatments at separate hospitals distantly located from their home. As a single mom, caring for one child suffering from cancer is very challenging physically, emotionally, and financially – now imagine having all three children with cancer.              Despite the limitations and challenges cancer has put them through, all three Goheen girls have been successfully living normal lives personally and professionally until their recent diagnoses and treatment plans made it impossible for them to work. Becky had surgery on September 13, 2018 at the University of Washington Medical Center. Tessie underwent surgery on September 24, 2018. Katie is no longer responding well to chemotherapy and the family is looking for other available treatments that could possibly help.            We are raising funds to support the Goheen family for lost income, ongoing medical expenses, travel expenses to and from the hospital, and any of the family's needs. If cancer has impacted you or someone you know and love in any way, you understand the devastating impact it can cause on your life physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, and financially – most especially when cancer has hit not only one, but four members of the family.            Every little bit helps.  When a close relative asked Beth: “Would you like me to be there with you?"" She said shyly, “I would love you to come, but honestly can you just continue working at your job and send me gas money instead?” We know Beth very well. Despite her dire financial situation, she is always shy to ask anyone for financial help. For her to ask for gas money means they are now in a desperate situation.  That is why we feel led to create a GoFundMe account for the Goheen family.            You may easily spend five dollars on a coffee break – but for this family it could mean gas money from one hospital to another. If you are unable to give for whatever reason, could you at least forward or share this story with anyone you know who may be able to help.  Contributing is a simple, but very meaningful way to support the Goheen Team in this difficult time.            As an old Proverb says:  Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.              Your prayers and help are highly appreciated.

In June of 2018 Claudia was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, which had spread to her lymph nodes, lungs, bones, and liver. Pancreatic cancer is usually terminal, especially at this stage,  and requires immediate and intense treatment. Standardized medical care guarantees only a 2% recovery rate, and requires aggressive chemotherapy and radiation, which also equally guarantees a poor and debilitating quality of life. After much prayer and research, Claudia has found a renowned alternative and integrative clinic in Mexico, just across the border from San Diego, known for its high rate of success in healing terminal cancer, and other chronic and traditionally incurable diseases. The medical tourism industry in Mexico is the highest in the world, and people from all over the globe come to get cured. Treatments which are efficient in curing cancer and other chronic diseases, which are not FDA approved in the US save people's lives here. Stem cell therapy, immunotherapies and metabolic therapies, including vaccines made from your own blood and body are at the forefront of healing people who, like Claudia, were given a life sentence back home. Her doctor has been at the forefront of curing cancer for 25 years, and he is a world renowned immunologist, who patented his own successful anti-cancer vaccine.  Powerful anti-cancer natural vaccines, supplements and antioxidants in the forms of IV's are administered daily to support the immune system, with a very low dose of insulin targeted chemotherapy which often has no side effects.  Claudia's sensitive system would not allow for full dose radiation and chemotherapy which was the only option in the States, and which would have only guaranteed her a couple of extra months to live with no chance of survival. Please read Claudia's recent blog and account of the medical industry in Mexico, and how you and others can also be saved from certain death by thinking outside of the box, and looking at alternative treatments outside the US. ""If you have  health insurance, that is actually your Death Insurance,"" Claudia wrote. Find out why, and about her first hand account talking to patients for the past 6 months who were sent home to die, but were saved coming to Mexico, and are now in remission!""Dying To Live In Mexico:""  https://claudiaghetuwellness.com/2018/11/23/dying-to-live-in-mexico/Needless to say, Claudia's insurance will not pay for the kind of treatment she has chosen. Insurance companies profit from the trillion dollar pharmaceutical global industry, with cancer treatment being at the top driving our economy! So, all of Claudia's costs are out of pocket! As you’ll see from her updates, she is making significant progress, and would have not otherwise succeeded in making it this far with traditional treatment.  The 100% standardized chemo therapy dosage, as it was relayed to her by her first integrative oncologist back in July, would have put her in a coma in less than a month.  Many people die from chemotherapy and radiation, and Claudia didn't want to ever undergo that inhumane and antiquated treatment, when there are in fact integrative and alternative options which guarantee a good chance of success even when dealing with pancreatic cancer. Also as a holistic health consultant, who has always believed in natural methods for healing the mind and body, Claudia knew immediately she wanted non-traditional and compassionate care,  in alignment with her own personal philosophy and spiritual core beliefs.  Initially the money required for treatment and the goal posted was $50K, which was to cover only the first 6-8 weeks of treatment, however after many subsequent tests Claudia and as per her doctors’  assessments, she needs to continue with 10 more months of medical care. In October Claudia had a set-back due to the metastasis in her bones, after she had made great improvements on her pancreas and liver, with tumors shrinking  at an accelerated rate, which impressed all the doctors.  She nearly lost her life, as she became suddenly incapacitated with excruciating pain in the spine and throughout all her  bones and muscles. Part of the reason was because she had taken a break from treatment and switched clinics, and was also low on funds and could not continue her treatment without interruption. This is when all the amazing people like you, kicked it and helped her find her current doctor and clinic which have saved her life. Her kind and extremely compassionate doctor, who took her in despite her lack of funds in October,  is a world renowned immunologist, and has successfully treated many well known people and alternative care advocates, including Suzanne Summers who continues to refer patients to hime, and credits him for saving her life! If you would like to find out who he is, you can contact Claudia directly. Claudia has applied for Social Security Disability Benefits which will not be available until next year. She has gone for the past 6 months without any government support, even though in her case they should have started paying her within a month of applying (July) due to the compassionate act for terminally ill cancer patients.  Your continued support will be of immense help, even once her small social security stipend kicks in early next year, as that would only cover the cost of rent and basic food. Claudia has always believed that true healing comes from  connecting to our divine nature, a supportive and spiritual environment, and from deep within ourselves. Her belief in God is unwavering and she is filled with divine gratitude, knowing that she was given this obstacle to overcome, only to transcend beyond worldly limitations and help others. As an Integrative Holistic Health Counselor, Nutritional Chef, and yoga and meditation teacher, she lives what she teaches  and is known to go the extra mile to empower, support,  and inspire those around her.  Even a few days before she was diagnosed, short of energy and barely able to eat, she visited someone in the hospital to give them wellness and spiritual counseling, and cooked for her clients until the day she had to go to the emergency room, making sure they wouldn’t miss out on their healthy meals. She has dedicated her life to helping others facing mental, emotional and physical challenges, and those seeking to transition to a healthier mind-body-spirit lifestyle. Now, she is the one in need of our support. She is using her own healing modalities to heal herself combined with the help of an amazing team of alternative doctors, who support her holistic choices, providing her with the compassion and motivation which she has always shown to others. She bravely turned down traditional chemotherapy and radiation treatments, which would only give her a 2% chance of survival. Those who know her well call her a warrior!

I am 23 years old and a Senior at West Virginia University studying International Studies with an emphasis in Business. While attending WVU I was able to be a part of the Collegiate Swimming and Diving Teams. Due to illness I had to withdraw from my classes last semester, but plan on finishing my degree this Spring. I hope to then enter a Master's Program in Mental Health and Rehabilitation Counseling to give me the opportunity to help people who may be going through similar struggles to the ones I have faced. I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Testicular Cancer in July of 2018, and received a surgery to remove the mass. Upon completion of the surgery the cancer was found to have moved to my Lymph Nodes. I have since been through Four rounds of Chemotherapy, was hospitalized twice, and now am facing another surgery to remove a mass in my Abdomen & Lymph Nodes.Today I received news that the mass has encapsulated my Aorta and also my Inferior Vena Cava. I have what is called a mixed germ cell tumor which contained 4 different kinds of Cancer. The Chemotherapy killed 3 of the 4 types of Cancer, but didn't affect the last kind in the mass which is bigger than my liver. I now am forced to  schedule a 6 to 8 hour surgery at Indiana University to remove it.  My doctors here recommended that I seek treatment in Indiana because this type of surgery is outside of the areas of expertise of my team and the doctors in Indiana deal with this type of surgery on a more frequent basis.  It is about a five hour trip there and I will be hospitalized for at least 4 days which only adds to my medical expenses as well as the cost of travel and lodging for me and my loved ones. I haven't been able to work due to treatment and now with the completion of my Chemo the Medical Bills are substantial. Anything you can give would be more than appreciated. My family and I would be eternally grateful for your contributions and even if you can't give anything sharing this fundraiser would mean the world to us.I want to thank each and everyone who has shared, and generously donated to make this opportunity possible. I am truly grateful to have the continued love and support throughout this challenging period in my life.

Greta took her last breath snuggled between her Mama and DadaThe pain we feel is unbearable, and words cannot express how much we already miss her, but we know our girl is no longer suffering. Our hearts are broken and will NEVER be the same. We LOVE you Miss Greta. #gladiatorgreta-----------------------------------------------------------------------This is Greta! And this is the story of Greta's battle with cancer...Greta was a happy, healthy energetic baby. Then she started having some vague symptoms, unexplained fever, a little nausea, less stamina. After various tests Greta went for an ultrasound and that's when our world was forever changed. The scans showed Greta had a mass on her liver. In September 2015, days before she turned 2 years old, Greta was diagnosed with Hepatoblastoma – an extremely rare liver cancer found in fewer than 1 in a million children.Greta started her first chemo treatment on her 2nd birthday. She tolerated her treatment extremely well!  Though she lost her hair and had to be isolated because of low immunity, Greta remained a happy, exuberant child. At the end of March 2016 – after 2 major surgeries, 10 chemotherapy sessions and endless pokes and procedures, she was done her treatment and had ""no evidence of disease"". The Oncologists said recurrence was unlikely. We were overjoyed!  We enjoyed the summer with Greta and her big brother Ben. Spending lots of time at the lake and watching her change from a baby to a little girl. Then, on a routine follow up doctor visit, we had disturbing results from a blood test - it looked like the cancer was back. More tests and scans revealed that it was. The good news was that it had not metastasized. We started chemo all over again almost exactly a year after the first round and were told she would need a liver transplant. We have been working extensively with doctors in Calgary, Toronto and Cincinnati on how best to take care of Greta’s relapsed hepatoblastoma (liver cancer).  Our Canadian doctors have done everything they can to help but, in this case, our system is far behind many of the large centers in the world.Dr. Geller, a paediatric oncologist at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, has a special interest in hepatoblastoma and much more experience than any Canadian doctors. . He has spoken with us at length about Greta's situation and has offered to help in any way he can. With being denied a transplant in Canada, he is our only chance to get Greta a healthy liver. He has been working closely with our Canadian doctors but is convinced he can do more to help Greta than is possible here. In his practice he has been personally been involved in 9 rescue liver transplants (transplant after resection) and 8 of these children are doing well! Dr. Geller believes Greta has and deserves a shot at life.But it is expensive! We are travelling to Cincinnati right away to start the evaluation process for a possible liver transplant and a procedure called T.A.R.E  which will help to hopefully stabilize her tumour and prevent it from spreading beyond her liver but we need approximately  $150K US for the procedure.  However, there is a chance they would be able to transplant right away. This would require A LOT more money.We asked for the cost of this treatment and were told that for initial evaluation, transplant surgery and follow up care and chemo until she can return home it would be USD $1.2M.  Above this would be travel and living expenses for us, Greta's parents, while she is in Cincinnati. At this time, AB Health Care will not be covering the cost of Greta’s transplant surgery.We need help! And we need it right away. Greta's life depends on it. So much of the journey through childhood cancer is lonely and isolating, but our friends and family have rallied around to support us as best they can. And we need you now more than ever. Every single dollar will help give Greta a chance at life, a chance she deserves.  If any funds collected are unused for Greta's care we will donate them to a Children's cancer care/research charity. Words cannot express how greatful we are for all the support and donations. Thank you!Love Steve, Lindsey, Ben and Greta xoxoInformation requested by GoFundMe:My name is Katie Findlay and I am a long time family friend working on behalf of the Marofke's to raise money to help Greta.

We first donated to the cause a few years ago. Through a contract with Baptist Children's Hospital, the CCCC was able to turn a  $3,000 donation into $12,000 worth of treatment for a family in need of help. ""During the past 51 years, no family has ever received a bill, and no child has ever been turned away"". The CCCC works with Baptist Hospital to not just treat children with cancer, but care for them.Our goal is to help in whatever way we can.

We got it all, from egg eating to rap battles, from slam poetry to egg eating, from egg eating to Sea Den performances, you're not gonna want to miss a second. We'll have many people at Jeremy's side to keep him awake as the clock runs down. We're going to have two donation structures during the live stream. One that is goal based, so as we reach different goals we'll perform different actions. The other structure is based on independent donations.

She had lower abdominal pain all summer long, and just before going back to finish her final year at Covenant College in Georgia, she went for a check up at her gynocologist to check for orvarian cysts. During a laproscopic procedure the cancer was discovered. After meeting several oncologists, Hanna felt strongly that she needed to pursue a natural approach to dealing with the disease. She was able to enter into the care of some of the best alternative doctors available who felt confident they could help her. And so, over the past 6 months Hanna has pursued every avenue of homeopathic treatments, traveling to doctors around the tri-state area every day of the week, sometimes two in one day. We found out two weeks ago that the the tumors in Hanna's abdomen have grown from 3 CM to 17.5 CM - and have englufed her bladder, uterus, ovaries and affected part of her liver.

We have no time to waste chasing down the insurance company. All donations will be put into the bank account of Hanna's mom - Hope, as she is sparing Hanna the financial burden as Hanna fights for her life. Throughout this entire experience, Hanna has remained steadfast and hopeful, which we credit to God and the immensely supportive community of friends and family who have come alongside her, prayed for her and sent notes of encouragement to Hanna. We recognize this is an incredible amount of money to try and raise in such a short amount of time, but her life depends on it.

I would like to share a small portion of it in hope that you can find it in your heart to help him during these trying times.  


In 2010 at the age of 24, Jacob was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He was living, volunteering, and teaching in Africa at the time and returned to the U.S.A. to recieve treatments at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City. After multiple surgeries over the course of a few months, including an RPLND which removed all of his lymph nodes throughout his entire abdomen, he was declared cancer free. He was left with astronomical medical bills, but he never once asked anyone for help. 


Jacob then went on to celebrate his remission by bicycling across the entire width of the U.S.A. Afterwards, he spent a few months learning how to build eco-friendy earthen homes and took this newly found skill back to Africa where he helped many rural families and communities to build affordable shelters. 


After returning home from Africa, Jacob fostered his passion to keep helping people by deciding to enroll back in school to become a nurse. He remembered how much of an important role the nurses played in his recovery and he wanted to have that impact on other people's lives as well.  


Along with being a full time nursing student at Rutgers University, he still found time to give back to other cancer patients and the staff at Memorial Sloan Kettering by volunteering to be a guest speaker and conselor to both new incoming hires and patients. 


Unfortunately, with only two semester left into finishing his goal, Jacob felt two lumps in his throat and his battle with cancer began again. 


After 7 years of remission, Jacob was diagnosed with testicular cancer once again. This time his cancer has aggressively returned and has spread throughout his body in multiple locations. This has left him in a 'high-risk' category and his treatment will be very difficult. 


Jacob will be undergoing 4 rounds of chemotherapy that includes 5 days of 5.5 hours of chemotherapy followed by 16 days off per cycle. If the chemotherapy responds well, he will then have to have multiple major surgeries to cut out the remaining cancer after a few months later. During this entire time he will not be able to work and his student financial aid loans have also been stripped away from him. This has left him with previous medical bills and zero financial support at this time. 


Jacob is such a prideful person that he would never ask for money, but as his brother, I am reaching out to the world to ask for any small donation that you could offer to help him during these times. I ask that if you cannot give yourself that you at least share his powerful story.  


My brother is an incredible man and there is so much more to his story that can't be written in such a small space. I ask that you support him during these times and know that any donation will be going towards a man who has spent his entire life giving to those who have needed it and is pledging to do so again as a nurse once healed.

Because it is so rare, there is minimal research or treatments for it. The government and pharmaceutical companies have no interest in investing their time or money for a rare disease, since there is no financial gain in it for them. This clearly makes my family and I feel abandoned. Despite these feelings, I refuse to let them cripple me. I have learned to advocate for myself and I will fight vigorously to live the long life I deserve.   I will fight for others who are diagnosed with this awful disease to have more options. Luckily there is a team of doctors at the University of Michigan that is lead by the amazing Dr. Gary Hammer, who have been researching cures for Adrenal Carcinoma to help people like myself. For my birthday on November 20th, there is no better birthday present than for my friends and family to help me raise money to present to Dr. Hammer when I go meet with him on December 11th for my next appointment. I believe this man will save my life and others like me, but he can’t do it alone. Here is a link to learn more about this rare disease and what Dr. Hammer and his team are doing to find a cure.

This is the story of our beautiful little girl Gabriella. October 1st 2017. It was the day that changed our lives forever. It was a beautiful fall Sunday morning and there she was: running around and playing as all three year olds do. We had to calm her down to get her dressed and ready for the day, when we felt a concrete like lump on her abdomen. We didn’t really know what to make of it since she showed no sign of discomfort or pain. We thought it would be best to take her down to urgent care to get checked out as it was Sunday and her pediatrician was closed. We took her there thinking they would just tell us it’s a milk allergy or a bad case of constipation. An X-ray of her stomach showed a large mass but they couldn’t really tell what it was for sure. They wanted to do a CT scan on her stomach to further tell what it could possibly be. After we took her in for the scan, we went back to the room and waited for the results. What seemed like hours had passed when the doctor working that day came in and told us what she believed it was. She told us it looks like a massive tumor and we needed to go to Boston Childrens Hospital IMMEDIATELY. Our hearts sank. We were overcome with confusion and fear. Without hesitation, we rushed her to the emergency room at Children’s and they took her back right away. What came next was a barrage of testing and scans. They needed to draw blood. They needed urine samples. They needed to do an MRI and another CT scan. By this time it was close to 10 pm when the doctor came in and told us they sent all of the images and blood work over to Dana Farber and a couple of oncologists were on their way to speak with us. They sat down with us and confirmed every parents worst fear. It was a 3 pound tumor growing off her adrenal gland. Neuroblastoma. Cancer. They would be scheduling surgery immediately.To say that Gabriella has been through a tough time is an understatement. At a time when most young kids are enjoying school, playing outside, spending time with family, Gabriella has spent the better part of a year in the hospital for a major surgery, two bone marrow aspirations, and countless doctors visits for checkups, blood tests and urine tests. She also has an MIBG bone scan and injection every 3-6 weeks. We thought she was in the clear as we approached the one year mark of her diagnosis, the doctors noticed a small mass on a routine ultrasound. Her catacholmine levels have started rising above the normal levels. She has her next MIBG scan and bone marrow aspiration in a few weeks, and we are praying that our worst fears won’t be confirmed again. There’s a quote that reads “when someone has cancer the whole family has cancer” and that couldn’t be any more true. Yet we remain as positive as possible. Gabriella will need follow up medical care for the foreseeable future. We already have mounting medical bills from the life saving treatment she has received and continues to receive from Children’s and the Jimmy Fund Clinic at Dana Farber. No child should have to endure what Gabby has. She has shown us what true strength is. She in the fight for her life and continues to amaze us with her sense of humor and her ability to laugh and smile during every one of her pokes and procedures.Any money raised from this Gofundme will be used to pay for further treatment and ongoing expenses related to Gabriella’s fight against this horrible disease.

To family and friends, Summer is the light of our lives. She is a character. She is smart, funny, caring, always happy. She is so much like her mother April, with her big blue eyes and a laugh that makes everyone smile. Like her dad Clint, she loves fishing, nature, the outdoors. I write this with a heavy heart that my niece has a long journey ahead of her.  Throughout last year, my sister April expressed strong concerns to several GPs and hospitals of Summers ongoing health issues. April ensured to receive second and third medical opinions as her intuition was telling her something was wrong. Each visit, Summer was overlooked and misdiagnosed for weight loss, snoring/sleep apnoeas, dyspnoea, and altered speech. On the 20th of December, Summer was transferred from Sunshine Coast University Hospital to Lady Cilento QLD Children's Hospital by ambulance and placed in an induced coma in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit for 6 days in a critical but stable condition. During this time, we received the devastating news that Summer has  a rare form of childhood cancer.  Summer awoke from her coma on Boxing Day and the Oncology Services Group began chemotherapy immediately. She is currently undertaking this intensive protocol chemotherapy treatments on a weekly basis that is expected to last approximately 12 months. Thereafter, she will be in remission for 2 years. As Summer progresses through treatment, she may experience a series of side effects associated with treatments including: nausea, vomiting, constipation, alopecia, increased risk of infections due to suppressed immune system functioning, weakness and muscle deterioration. Summer's care needs will escalate above the care needs of a child her age. She will require extensive support with daily activities such as showering, walking and dressing. These side effects are expected to worsen over the coming months as her treatment intensifies. Summer will need specialised care for the entirety of her treatment. This is a full-time responsibility that April will be required to prioritise. April will be unable to return to work or continue her educational studies. The next 12 months, Summer will be reliant on receiving her nutrients via a nasograstric (NG) tube attached to a feeding bag. Radiaotherapy will also commence some time during this year.  It has been confirmed that Summer will suffer from infertility. We have created a Gofundme page to raise awareness, and if you feel that you would like to share your support in whatever way possible, please feel free to do so. Her diagnosis was unexpected and this treatment will strain the family finances significantly. As I am sure you can understand, this is a very difficult time for April, Clint and both families as we adjust to Summer's diagnosis and support her through treatment. Funds raised will go towards living expenses (accommodation, transport, food, parking etc), medical costs (medicine, NG feeding material, syringes, port-a-cath patches etc) and general support costs for Summer's fight against cancer.  Other ways that you can support are through giving blood via the Australian Red Cross Foundation  https://www.donateblood.com.au. Food vouchers, fuel vouchers, in-home support services, early learning programs and experiences for Summer will all help contribute to her healing and recovery. April's sisters Natalie, Gemma and I will be hosting a fundraising event called ""Sounds for Summer"" filled with music, markets and prizes.

In July 2016, at the age of 28 he was diagnosed with stage three colon/rectal cancer . He has been in and out of hospitals from October 2016 to September 2017 following the traditional route of chemotherapy, radiation and colostomy .We thought the worst was behind us as TJ was adjusting to his new life with a permanent ostomy bag,when we were dealt a heavy blow this Christmas. Suffering from unbearable pain, he was rushed to the Hospital and 2 surgeries later, his doctors confirmed our worst fears...his cancer had returned.Radiation is no longer an option as TJ has been given his lifetime quota of radiation. Also, his chemotherapy options are very limited, too limited to give us a good prognosis. Doctors have recommended surgery, however it has not been approved by the insurance and TJ is very weak. This 4th major surgery is going to be very difficult on his body, especially since he's done 3 major surgeries in less than 12 months.  The recovery period has become very difficult and painful for him with no guarantees of success.We have however, been handed a lifeline through an alternative therapy option called ""Ozone Therapy"" and believe it's our best chance at saving TJ's life. In addition to being a natural alternative to eradicate cancer, TJ will be educated on how to follow a healthy diet to maximize his chances at a cancer free life. The ""Ozone Therapy"" will be 3 times per week over an 8 month period and is geared towards creating a hostile environment within the body that makes it impossible for cancer cells to survive. The total cost of therapy, special diet, minerals and supplements will be $34,000 which unfortunately TJ's insurance company will not cover either.We believe that this is our brother's best chance of beating his cancer and we ask for your support in reaching our Goal.Nicholas and Alicia",efa7189919661077ff3c86da3d198d4b,14,1.0074117647058825,330.0,0,1,general,1,1,0,1,0,0.0026109660574412533,0.0,0.9580188679245283,2.796967129861174,0.0,gofundme

Sweat drops under her eyes. you could take a towel dry her off and when you were finished with that first swipe, she was wet all over again.)  not only did Bridgette have the sweating to deal with but she started sleeping a lot losing her appetite. Bridgette went from being over weight to dropping pounds on the scale. Only when the dr weighed her, you saw she didn't lose anything.  :( We had to start buying smaller diapers and getting out her smaller clothes.  She started getting dark circles under her eyes. Her belly started to bulge. she started eating again in BIG portions like she was starving but never gained a pound or showed it. I then made a appointment with Bridgette 's dr they ordered to have some lab work done, little did we realize what a long tough road Bridgette had I front of her.  She went threw blood work lot of blood. she had a ultra sound, allergy tests, parasites, all kinds of testing for a whole year! Still no answers and we were no closer to finding out what was wrong with Bridgette.  But Bridgette has developed a huge fear of the doctors. As a parent and trying to find out what is wrong with your child and seeing nothing being found, when as a parent do you say enough is enough? Well for me it was time, my husband and I made the choice to bring Bridgette 3 hours away from home to Boston Children's hospital. Knowing this was going to be a hard trip ahead. We packed our things with high hopes to find out once and for all what was wrong with Bridgette .When we got there she needed lots of blood work again and this didn't make poor Bridgette happy. She shakes cries and so scared I have never seen such a fear of doctors as she is. Then came the MRI of her brain, that was cleared but they did find abnormal test on Bridgette, she has a thyroid problem they found. Then more abnormal test made them find more. We still are not sure exactly what is wrong with Bridgette.  But they told us she needs to be tested for a cancerous tumor. New MRI,pet scans, lab work and ultra sounds. We are in a bind all these medical expenses have brought us to a painful halt.  The thing about Bridgette is she is a rare kid event tho she is very sick and she is still so happy and sweet. So far at Boston we have been informed that Bridgette needs to be checked in to the Dana Farber Cancer Institution. They are now having Bridgette stay impatient for the next week.

Unfortunately the insurance companies do not agree nor are they willing to pay for any type of treatment that they don't deem standard. As I said she's been there and knows first hand what works for her however that isn't enough to have it funded by insurance. So many of you have been generously helping on another Go Fund Me page set up to help and as of today she is more than a quarter of the way to her goal of $40,000 which will allow her to have the treatments in the manner both she and her doctors know is right for her. This brings me to the light bulb above my head. I have a WIN-WIN-WIN idea thats nothing but positive for all involved. What is the ""Tie That Binds"" us all together? Bruce, of course! I wonder if he knows just how much his music and our love for all things E Street has strengthened all of us at one point or another. He continues to give in so many different ways always reinventing himself and sharing it with us. What if we could thank Bruce & help Judy at the very same time? Interested? As so many of you know I have started a business called Audrey Hunn Designs. I make personalized photo gifts that are as individual and special as the recipient they're for. With that said I am donating my time, my art & the cost of making Bruce a ""Thank You/Birthday"" blanket for his upcoming birthday which also just happens to be right before the start of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The blanket will consist of pictures of Bruce & his fans from all different periods of his career. If you've had the good fortune to meet Bruce at any point whether it be at a book signing, outside the Broadway show, on the street, in an airport or maybe even on stage with him I want your photo to be a part of the blanket. A $25 donation will get your photo on a small square.  A $50 donation will get it on a larger square. Last but certainly not least a $100 donation will get you the largest sized square and you can also send me a personal birthday card for Bruce that will accompany all of this along with a description of this project and how our love of all things E Street has helped yet another one of our own. I will furnish those with my mailing address later to send a card. What I can promise is delivery of the blanket.  Anyone who knows me knows when I set out to do something I don't rest until its done! Every single dollar raised through this project will go directly to Judy and her fight to get healthy. I have set up this Go Fund Me page, which is different from the other set up by a friend of hers a while back.  This is just for the blanket project and I know so many of you have so generously donated prior to this project but this is the only donation location that is connected to the blanket. After donating please email me your picture along with your name to aud425@comcast.net and put ""Bruce Blanket"" in the subject line. Please do not post your picture you'd like to use here unless you email it as well. The deadline to get your picture in is SEPTEMBER 1st! Thank you in advance for visiting our page, for donating and for helping to ""TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN!""",b30757c0e09d640e82aeb288da528388,33,0.3741,180.0,2,1,breast cancer,0,5,0,2,0,0.007352941176470588,0.0,0.04380403458213256,8.25942955291939,0.0,gofundme

Or, rather, we rescued each other. The Navajos have a serious stray dog problem, and the crippling poverty of the Reservation creates less-than-ideal living conditions for their dogs, many of whom become abandoned. Such was the case with Tucker. He showed up at the front step of my house to drink from the pot of water I put out for the homeless dogs on my street, and looked at me through the screen door with the saddest eyes I had ever seen.Since that day, Tucker and I have become closer and closer, and have developed a bond that is hard to describe. I know that sounds magical and, if you saw how scared he was when I first met him, you would know that word is very appropriate. He quickly became my best friend in a place of desolation and loneliness. This was my first time truly away from all family and friends, and I was bored out of my mind and struggling to connect with people. I was working for DNA-People's Legal Services for an unpaid internship, but I spent my free time (and a good deal of time at work) being a dog whisperer of sorts. It was hard for me to make friends in such a short time there, and although my little 9 year old neighbor Dinesha and my roomate Chad were around most of the time, the one who laid by my side the whole time was Tucker. My constant companion, Tucker was there for me this summer, and I became his source of food, water, shelter, and most most importantly, love. Unfortunately, Tucker's story is not filled with all sunshine and rainbows. Before he arrived at my door, he had been roaming around the streets and hunting for his food after his owner abandoned him. He had accumulated about 40 ticks engorged all over his body. The process of removing all the ticks was painstaking; Tucker didn't like the flea and tick spray, and he ran away if I made any sudden movements. Tucker was very distrustful at first, and he still is with strangers and little kids. However, slowly but surely, I gained his trust, through food and affection, and as I moved the food bowl further and further into my house, Tucker began to trust me more. Then, one day, I turned around and he was gone. He had snuck into my bedroom and laid down on my bed. That day, Tucker decided that I was going to be his home, forever. Although many Navajos care for and love their dogs much the same as I do, it was definitely a different environment concerning dogs on the Reservation. Most of the dogs are not house pets and some are not pets at all. Estimates vary, but there are about 5,000 stray dogs on the Reservation alone. So, although Tucker may be unique in many ways, his predicament was quite common. Unfortunately, while roaming the Reservation, Tucker had his fair share of sexual encounters. As most of the dogs on the Reservation do not get spayed or neutered, there is a high prevalence of canine coitis, and it has serious repercussions, as I found out months later. I decided to bring Tucker and his brother Red back to Wisconsin to give them homes. I took them to the vet in Chinle, Arizona and paid to get them neutered and all of their vaccinations so they would be healthy and ready for a new home in Wisconsin. After my time was done on the Navajo Reservation, my brother and I brought Tucker and Red (his brother)back to Wisconsin on a weeklong road trip that brought puke, diarrhea, and some amazing moments as well.Zach, Red, Me and Tucker at Monument ValleyRed and Tucker snoozing and cruisingHiking through the canyons of Moab, UtahOnce back in Wisconsin, I was worried that Tucker wouldn't get along well with out dog, Koda. Tucker quickly dispelled any doubts that I had, and soon him and Koda were running around the yard and cuddling together in my bed. After the fighting, ticks, and other obstacles all seemed to fade away, I thought Tucker was home safe and sound.However, in September, he started to bleed from his penis. The bleeding got pretty bad, and he was making a mess in the house, so we had to put a diaper on him at all times. The veterinarian diagnosed him with a Transmissable Veneral Tumor (TVT), an unusual cancer, one that is uncommon in this part of the country.Fortunately, we learned that this is actually a very treatable disease; at this stage there is a 90-95% rate of successful removal. The treatment will cost about $300 per visit, and it usually takes about 6 rounds of chemo to cure this type of tumor. The tumor is highly contagious, and he is currently living with my family and other dog, Koda, so we will be starting treatment right away on January 19th. I am currently a fourth-year student in college and don't have the money to pay for thetreatment. I work two jobs on campus and already have sizable student loans waiting for me when I graduate, so any help would be greatly appreciated. You should also know that any help will be paid forward inthe future. I have already found homes for three dogs on my own this summer, and a big thank-you goes out to my cousin Nick and his wife Carly (and their dog Jasper) for taking my beloved Red into their hearts and home, as well as the woman who adopted my little friend Shaggy. I volunteer regularly at the Poweshiek Animal League Shelter. I put more time in this summer as a dog whisperer than a law clerk, and I have no qualms about it. Those of you who know Tucker know that he is usually terrified of meeting new people and as a rule does not trust strangers. So, if you could give him a reason to put his faith back in people by helping out his cause, he would greatly appreciate it.I wish everyone could love someone the way Tucker loves me. The unbridled joy with which he greets me every time I walk in the door, no matter how long my absence, fills my heart with joy every day. The faith he put in me to take care of him this summer, after he had been mistreated, abandoned, and lonely for months, amazes me. He has made me laugh and cry and feel alive in ways that nothing ever has before. Your help couldn't be going to a dog more deserving. Thank you so much. Tucker is already a loyal Packers fan. Brett Favre is his favorite player, naturally. Tucker is a big fan of the snow, just not of snowmen.",83f92cef11455302f56bb993c5503350,51,1.0375,720.0,4,1,general,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

Je venais de vivre une séparation déchirante puisque j'avais un petit garçon âgé de moins de 2 ans... Le 5 décembre, je faisais la rencontre d'une femme merveilleuse, un coup de foudre, qui s'est révélé être mon âme soeur, la flamme de ma vie. Cependant, le lendemain, alors que je suivais une formation de pilote, mon rêve professionnel, une nouvelle terrible tombait, j'apprenais que j'avais un cancer des testicules. Tout s'est bousculé très vite ensuite: le 23 décembre suivant, je subissais ma première opération et la chimiothérapie débutait en janvier 2011. Ce traitement a duré jusqu'au 31 mars et j'ai été extrêmement malade. Ma conjointe, que je venais tout juste de rencontrer, était présente et me soutenait malgré les difficultés et les embûches sur notre chemin.  Je me relevais tranquillement, mais sûrement. Par la suite,  en tentant de reprendre le cours normal de ma vie, j'étais engagé chez Skyjet, une compagnie d'aviation, afin de me rapprocher de mon emploi de pilote que j'aimais tant. Par contre, je n'ai jamais pu obtenir le certificat médical me permettant de reprendre à voler. Je n'abandonnais pas et je continuais d'avancer en occupant un emploi de bureau temporaire. Au moment où je devais obtenir la permission médicale afin de recommencer à piloter, le ciel m'est retombé sur la tête: le cancer était revenu, encore!! Mes ganglions lymphatiques étaient de nouveau inflamés et je devais être opéré encore... Une opération majeure qui a duré près de 10 heures et qui comportait un lot de risques très élevés. Nous apprenions au même moment que ma femme était enceinte... Enfin, nous avions l'impression de pouvoir respirer et nous pensions que la maladie était derrière nous.J'ai retroussé mes manches, encore une fois et je suis retourné au travail au printemps. Ma femme et moi n'avons eu quelques mois supplémentaires de répit, mais à l'automne 2012, une ombre revenait planer sur notre famille: je n'étais plus en rémission.Les émotions s'entre-mêlaient et avec la maladie, ces moments qui auraient dû n'être que du pur bonheur étaient déchirants et difficiles, un combat de chaque instant. Le cancer était plus fort. J'ai donc décidé de demander ma conjointe en mariage afin de ne pas laisser ma famille dans le besoin, si jamais le pire venait à arriver. Pendant ma nuit de noces, ma fille venait au monde, plus tôt que prévu. Ensuite, les médecins ont donc décidé d'y aller avec une chimiothérapie de pré greffe et deux chimiothérapies agressives nécessitant une greffe de cellules souches afin que mon système immunitiaire redémarre. Malheureusement, la première greffe n'a pas eu l'effet escompté, cela ne fonctionnait pas... Une nouvelle qui fût plutôt difficile à comprendre et à accepter. Les médecins m'offrent alors de m'opérer à nouveau, avec tout le lot de risque que cela comportait. Mai 2013: la chirurgie arrive enfin, mais on doit m'enlever un rein afin d'accéder à la tumeur. On a aussi dû m'enlever une partie importante de l'intestin et j'ai eu un nerf d'écrasé dans la jambe droite. Évidemment, les choses n'ont pas été aussi simples: post-opératoire a été un véritable cauchemar. Les points de sutures faits à l'intestin n'ont pas tenus comme prévu. J'ai fait de multiples infections qui m'ont amené à faire plusieurs séjours à l'hôpital pendant 8 mois, pour finalement me faire réopérer en décembre 2013 pour les intestins pour réparer ce petit bobo. Tous ces évènements ont été difficiles au niveau financier et m'ont obligé à faire faillite.En mars 2014, j'ai enfin pu retourner au travail dans une quincaillerie. Moi et ma femme tentions de reprendre une vie de famille normale et plus équilibrée. Nous avons réussit à maintenir ce fragile équilibre et nous avions espoir d'avoir laissé tout ça derrière nous. Nous avons donc reconstruit notre vie pendant un peu plus d'un an. BOOM!!! En mai 2015, il est de retour, petit et à un seul endroit. En août 2015, une opération préventive est alors effectuée et une nouvelle chimiothérapie, très agressive, est recommencée, afin d'être sûr que cette fois serait la bonne. La chimiothérapie s'est terminée en février 2016, mais encore une fois, nous n'avions pas les résultats escomptés. Les médecins du Québec ne peuvent plus m'offrir de solutions et ma meilleure option devient la recherche et les traitements expérimentaux. Je n'ai pas abandonné et je suis parti à Toronto pour essayer des traitements expérimentaux de phase 1. Ça a duré encore quelques mois, où je devais voyager entre ma résidence de Québec et l'hôpital de Toronto. Cependant, une meilleure option s'offre maintenant à moi: des traitements de phase 2 offerts à New-York que la Régie de l'assurance maladie ne couvre pas.Même si je reçois une grande aide de la fondation Nez pour vivre, je suis plus que conscient qu'elle n'a pas un sac sans fonds pour m'aider à payer mes traitements.Ces soins coûtent cependant très cher et ce, sans compter les déplacements que je devrai effectuer dans un autre pays. C'est ici et maintenant que j'ai besoin de votre aide. Vos dons me permettraient d'obtenir les soins dont j'ai grandement besoin et de couvrir mes déplacements entre Québec et New-York Ma course pour la vie est loin d'être terminée et je vous remercie d'avance pour toute l'aide que vous m'apporterez!***ENGLISH VERSION***In 2010, my life was turned upside down in many ways ... I had just experienced a heartbreaking separation and I had a little boy under the age of two. On December 5th, lightning struck me, I met a wonderful woman who turned out to be my soul mate, the light of my life. However, the next day as I was undergoing pilot training, my professional dream, I received terrible news, I learned that I had testicular cancer.Everything rushed by very quickly then: on December 23rd I underwent my first operation and then began chemotherapy in January of 2011. The treatments lasted until March 31st and I was extremely ill. My girlfriend, whom I had just met, was always present and supported me despite the difficulties and the pitfalls along the way. Slowly but surely, I was able to get back on my feet. Then, trying to get back to a normal life, I was hired by Skyjet, an airline company, to get closer to my goal as a pilot that I loved so much. However, I was never able to obtain the medical certificate allowing me to resume flying. I did not give up and I continued to advance in a temporary office job.When I had to get medical permission to start piloting again, my world collapsed: the cancer had returned again!! My lymph nodes were again inflamed and I had to be operated again ... a major operation that lasted nearly 10 hours and which involved a lot of very high risks. Finally, we felt we could breathe a little and we thought the disease was behind us. We learned at the same time that my girlfriend was pregnant. I rolled up my sleeves again and went back to work in the spring. My girlfriend and I had a few more months of hope, but in the fall of 2012, there was a shadow over our family: I was no longer in remission.  Emotions intermingled and with the illness, these moments which should have been pure happiness were heartbreaking and difficult, a struggle at every moment. The cancer was stronger. So I decided to ask my girlfriend to marry me so as not to leave my family in need, if ever the worst happened. During my wedding night, my beautiful daughter was born sooner than expected. Then the doctors decided to go with pre-graft chemotherapy and two aggressive chemotherapy treatments requiring stem cell transplantation to restart my immune system. Unfortunately, the first graft did not have the desired effect, it did not work. A piece of news that was rather difficult to understand and accept. The doctors then offered to operate again with all the risks involved. May 2013: the surgery finally arrives, but they have to remove a kidney in order to access the tumor. They also had to remove a large part of the intestine and I had a crushed nerve in the right leg. Obviously, things were not that simple: the post-operation was a nightmare. The stitches made to the intestine did not hold as expected. I got multiple infections which led me to have several stays in the hospital for 8 months, to finally re-operate in the intestines once again in December 2013 to repair a small tear. All these events were difficult financially and forced me to go bankrupt. In March 2014, I finally went back to work at a hardware store. My wife and I resumed a more normal and balanced family life. We managed to maintain this fragile equilibrium and we hoped to have left all that behind us. So we started to rebuild our lives. Well that lasted for a little over a year.BOOM!!! In May 2015, the cancer was back, small and in one place. In August 2015, a preventive operation is carried out and a new chemotherapy, very aggressive, is restarted, in order to be sure that this time it is the right one. Chemotherapy was completed in February of 2016, but again, we did not have the results we wanted. The Quebec physicians could no longer offer me solutions and my best option became research and experimental treatments. I did not give up but was obligated to go to Toronto to try an experimental Phase 1 treatment. It lasted a few months and I had to keep travelling between my residence in Quebec City and the Toronto hospital. Unfortunately, even though this treatment was very experimental and there wasn’t a big chance that it would work and it didn’t meet our expectations, it gave me a chance to meet the experts in research. A better option now exists for me: Phase 2 treatments offered in New York. Unfortunately, the Health Insurance Board does not cover these treatments.

I have been staring at this blank screen for what feels like days. In this chapter of my life, I truly need your love and support. I am asking my expansive community to come together and please offer what they can. In 2018, I began feeling deep waves of fatigue which brought me to research Lyme and Autoimmune Diseases.  Everything then shifted in November when I found a lump in my left breast. What followed was multiple mammograms, ultrasounds, and 2 invasive biopsies. On December 21st I received the call and heard the nurse say the mass was malignant. In that moment I was diagnosed with breast cancer. The cancer is known as INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA. There is still much unknown simply because the mass is still within my body. Genetic testing is needed since breast cancer does not run in my family. Also, another chest MRI for more details and then the partial mastectomy. This will be followed by a reconstructive surgery and then 6 weeks of daily radiation. After this, hormonal therapy for 5 years. Chemotherapy is still in question until my first surgery is had and lymph nodes are analyzed through pathology. The tumor is a quarter in scale. The stage of my cancer is still unknown.I am presently trying to slow down and intentionally build my foundation for healing. This moment in life is guiding me to learn the importance of asking for what I need and allowing myself the gift to receive. A good reminder we are part of a larger whole. And so, this is where you come in. I want to remove as much financial stress as possible so I can focus on caring for myself. I do have insurance which covers part but the co-pays and unforeseen expenses will add up. I want to fully support my immune and nervous system through integrative modalities (e.g., acupuncture, massage, reiki, herbs, and nutrition). I want to afford a home I can have friends and family stay with me during recovery. Being a single woman living alone in New York City makes this a very creative project since it is one of the most expensive cities in the world. Being an artist, I am up for the challenge. The surreal aspect of this news has been like no other. At times the weight of this reality swings between a bag of bricks to a heightened state full of gratitude. Going through so many emotions with the knowing this chapter will forever change me. With this said, I thank you for loving and supporting me to live a full, creative life while I continue on this journey. Please know I am forever grateful for your contributions. Onward!Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.Carla.",83d6ea5b2b3d1fb5d995e13a2a00227f,35,0.30416666666666664,20.0,5,1,breast cancer,0,0,1,0,1,0.0,0.002109704641350211,0.9568671963677639,0.0,1.0,gofundme

He proceeded to buy a pack of donuts and a drink and went and sit down at one of the tables but, before he could get seated at a table, the owner, Donna Crosby, grabbed him by his shirt and pulled him into her office. She told him “IF HE WAS GOING TO EAT IN HERE HE WOULD HAVE TO COVER HIS FACE!!” He left and went home in tears to tell me what happened.My father is a cancer survivor he lost his left eye and nose to this awful cancer. My father was discriminated against because of the way he looks. He cannot help what the cancer did to him. My father is the strongest man iIknow but, as he told me what happened to him, I watched tears roll out of his eye. It hurt me to see him hurt like this, especially over something he cannot help. My father is also on a fixed income and can not afford the surgeries it would to take to fix his where his nose was. Just so you know, Donna Crosby, my father can not cover his face with an eye patch. It rubs the eye socket raw and where his nose was. It has to stay open and nothing is to touch that area that might rub it raw. I thank GOD every one is not as small mined as Donna Crosby! I promise you he will never ever set foot in that store again! You should never judge a book by its cover until u have walked a mile in his shoes Donna Crosby. You discriminated against MY farther (Kirby Evans) for the way he looks. Here are some words of advise for you. DROP TO YOUR KNEES AND PRAY YOU NEVER GET CANCER BECAUSE IT DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE LIKE U DID TO MY FARTHER (KIRBY EVANS)!Please every one hit the SHARE button THANK YOU ALL AND GOD BLESS !  =================================================================================================== Hi my name is Brandy Evans I am Mr.Kirbys daughter. We live in Walterboro South Carolina. Mr.Kirby (aka Dad ) has lived with me here in our home for the last 5 years, with me and his 2 grand children. We do ourbest to see to his every day needs. However I can not afford his medical bills and he is on a fixed income.   I or my Dad would be using your kind donations to cover his medical costs for Dr. visits and surgery's/recovery he may need. We also would like to look into getting him a prosthetic nose. When dad first had his nose and eye removed do to the (basal cell carcinoma) they had to remove a lot of bone from his face and aroundhis eye. They had to get clean margins.I am sad to say it looks as if his body is rejecting some of the material  that they used to reconstruct around his eye.So this is one of the major things we need to have checked.   I would also like to have him checked from head to toe to make sure he is still cancer free. He has a spot that I am worried about on top of his head and it needs to be checked asap. Dad also has a few other health issues that I am concerned with he has high blood pressure,diabetes and his eye needs to be checked,as I can see that his eye sight is failing. Last time he had his eye checked he could not afford the special glasses he would need made.The Eye Dr. would have to make him something like a eye monocle that would clipto his hat.     Dad and I set up a joint account at a bank here in Walterboro to receive the funds that you all so generously donated to him.Kirby Evans is the primary and I am the secondary on this account we set it up together.

I can only hope that my decision to deal with this in the only way I knew how hasn't caused anyone to be offended.

The family is requesting donations to help with mounting medical bills and out of pocket expenses. Please read Teresa’s story below:Early in May of 2017, Teresa Sensinger was diagnosed with Glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. She underwent surgery but due to the tumor’s location, total removal was not possible. From there, Teresa underwent vigorous physical therapy along with high dose chemo and radiation therapies. Her surgery had left her with some physical deficits, but her positive spirit was unwavering. By August, Teresa was able to come home from the hospital just in time to celebrate her seventh birthday with family and friends. Through the summer and fall, her doctors continued with the most aggressive treatment options possible to prevent the reoccurrence and spread of the cancer cells. Unfortunately, by fall of 2017, the doctors found that the tumors had returned. Through the help of the “Make-A- Wish Foundation”, Teresa was able to walk the beautiful beaches of Florida, visit Sea World, Disney, the Kennedy Space Center, and visit with family in Georgia.After returning home from her trip, Teresa continued with her chemo treatments. In January, a follow up scan revealed several new tumors extending down her spine. Her doctors determined that as aggressive as the chemo was, it just wasn’t working. The medical team decided to discontinue the chemo, and began a palliative course of radiation. Teresa completed this last course of treatment on February 20th, but was readmitted to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) just two days later with nausea and uncontrollable headaches. Her doctors have worked tirelessly searching for treatment options to give her relief. At that time, Teresa was experiencing severe balance deficits and had lost most of her hearing, and later her ability to speak, but the hope was that these were side effects of the radiation and would subside with time.This past Friday, Teresa’s parents, Andrew and Michelle, sat down with their team of doctors and received the worst news any parent could imagine. The latest scan showed the tumor had now wrapped around Teresa’s brain stem and there was nothing more they could do. This coming Tuesday, the hospital will be transporting her back home under hospice care, where she can be surrounded by her family and loved ones. Due to mounting medical bills and out of pocket expenses not all covered by insurance, the family is requesting donations to alleviate the financial burden on Andrew and Michelle. Remember, every little bit helps and no contribution is too small as we read in Mark 12: 41-44.The family also requests your prayers during this difficult time. All donations will be given to the Sensinger family, Michelle and Andrew.￼￼￼￼￼￼",7fa215518537e35ce1aa60aa31e93c1e,21,0.86248,300.0,0,1,brain cancer,0,1,0,1,0,0.00211864406779661,0.0,0.02718717323109097,1.9562091862214102,0.0,gofundme

Whilst shoveling, I let Pancho and Holly ""help"" me out. By help I mean run around the yard playing in the snow and saying Hi to all the neighbors. This is something I always do with the dogs, but unlike all the other times when the dogs and I went back in the house, I noticed Holly limping. She was still her joyful, energetic self so initially I didn't believe it to be an issue. Fast forwarding to now, she is still limping and also had an open wound on her opposite leg which we thought was a spider bite that had gotten worse. My wife and I decided it was time to go to the vet. Unfortunately, the wound is not a spider bite. Her joyful and energetic demeanor are poor indicators in regard to how Holly is really feeling. Holly has a cancerous tumor on her left paw and a torn ACL in her right leg. This is absolutely disheartening to my wife and I because to some they are just dogs, but to us they are our kids. They are essential members of our family. They add value to our day to day lives and our family is not whole without Holly. Anybody who does know Claudia and I also know that everything in our life includes Holly. People who have seen us interact with Holly understand that we do not treat her like a ""pet"". So what are we doing for Holly? We got this news today and 2 hours later I have two applications in for a second job and more to come. So I am going to give every minute of my free time to ensuring that her life can be continued and the quality of her life can continue to be great after she overcomes this obstacle. So you can rest assure that I'm not just asking for a handout without putting forth all of my own effort as well. For those of you who do know me, I don't ask anybody for anything and I always take care of my family so for me to do this is very humbling. Holly's first surgery, to remove the tumor on her left paw, is the 23rd of November. Exactly 10 days from today. We're hopeful that it will only require one surgery and that the cancer has not spread. This surgery is going to be $1,227.98. Her ACL repair surgery is going to be after she recovers from her tumor removal. For her ACL, we were quoted $5,000.

She had melanoma in 2006 and had the spot removed by a dermatologist.  It has come back and is in her lung now.  Obviously we were devastated by this news.  She had to spend a week in the hospital and has gone back to stay twice since then for minor complications. She hasn't been able to work since June, when she first started experiencing symptoms and due to a paperwork snafu, she is still waiting for disability to kick in for all of that time.  She's doing good right now, responding well to the targeted therapy meds that she takes orally each day. These cost $11,000 per month but luckily her insurance covers most of it. She does have medical expenses for hospital, scans, tests, doctor visits, etc along with her regular living expenses and she could use some financial assistance in the short run.  If you have anything to spare, your thoughtfulness and generosity would be greatly appreciated. If you know  Beverly personally, you know she's a wonderful person who would do anything for anybody. She is an amazing mother and we are so grateful to still have her with us. Last month she had to replace her stove and furnace, and I know she is stressing about finances. That is the last thing we want for her to have to worry about!  If all you can offer is prayers and positive thoughts at this time, we'll gladly take that!!!

He has not a mean bone in his body and he has a knack for making you laugh when it's appropriate and more often when it's not.As many of you know by now, and for those of you who don't, Richard is a survivor of bladder cancer. True to his nature, he dealt with his ordeal with self-deprecating sense of humor in the face of a terrifying and often painful situation. After several years of being in remission during which he  worked his ass off opening yet another successful restaurant, Richard's curse has come back in the form of  Stage 4 cancer in the lymph nodes and other parts of his urinary tract. Officially, metastatic to lymph node, intra abdominal and transitional cell carcinoma, right ureter. With that cheery bit of news from his oncologist, compounded by the threat of potential kidney failure, Richard is clearly fighting for his life.He has begun his ""full-on"" aggressive chemotherapy  as of January 15. The treatment and subsequent surgery, and recovery will last several months requiring every bit of his signature humor, as well as most of his money, to win this battle.  A win for Richard will be a win for all of us.His lovely wife Terumi is working long hours as a Manager at Trailblazer Tavern in SF while using the rest of her very limited waking hours to help Richard deal with the physical and mental aftershock of chemotherapy.

I am just shy of 50 years old and I have been diagnosed with Breast and uterine cancer. When I received my diagnosis in October 2017 with breast cancer and December of 2017 with uterine cancer, I was paralyzed with fear. I was also 160 pounds overweight, understanding that in order to get well, I needed to take charge of the things I could control. I reached out to a person I respected the most for guidance and he has helped me with an eating  program  that I implemented to help heal. I lost 105 pounds in 15 months~(still a way to go!)

I want this disease eradicated from my body, to be able to stay present in my life, take care of myself and not have to live with  lifelong, crippling side effects.  My life has changed so much because of this experience.

Ashton with Mom, Dad and little brother Grayson. Happy, healthy and and full of life. Every day was a joy to watch our children grow; excited for the life that we were going to create together….Something is not rightOn November 16, 2017, life as we knew it, as Ashton knew, changed. Ashton had recently been complaining of headaches leading up to that day. We didn’t think much of it because he was still “Ashton”. Happy, inquisitive, ready to learn something new and ready to play. His condition suddenly worsened. He began to vomit, lose his balance and his eyes were starting to go crossed. We immediately took him to the local hospital where we were told that there was something seriously wrong and that we needed to take him to Vanderbilt Children's Hospital right away. The doctors performed an MRI and they discovered multiple tumors growing on his brain. In an instant, our worst nightmare became a reality. Ashton has brain cancer.                           The long road to recoveryOn November 20, Ashton underwent brain surgery to remove a large tumor on his cerebellum, as this was the immediate concern to his health. After the procedure, the doctors diagnosed Ashton with Medulloblastoma. This is a very rare form of cancer with roughly 250 cases a year. The doctors determined that the remaining tumors can be treated with high dose chemo and possible radiation for the next 7-8 months. Stronger togetherThe cost of the treatment is astronomical and the funds are inaccessible to us. Alone, we cannot provide the funds needed to cure our son, so that he may live a full life. We have turned to crowdfunding as our only hope. With all of your help, Ashton will have the best chance at survival and recovery.

Life was moving along for us - certainly we had some bumps along the road, but never did we expect to receive the news we did.  On December 3, 2015, I experienced what was thought to be a seizure or stroke. I was rushed to the hospital, put through many tests, and by the end of the day was being transferred to Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix with what was determined to be an aggressive brain tumor called Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). In an instant, my thoughts went from the joy the holidays bring to “what do I need to do to fight this and WIN so I can see my four beautiful children grow up?” I was told to prepare for the worst and given 10 months as a projected time to live. How did this happen? It really doesn't matter. What matters is my wife Aimee and I fully reject it, and we’re committed to fighting.  On December 14, 2015, I had a successful extended surgery where the doctor was very aggressive in removing the tumor. Now, we prepare for phase two which is to heal and get ready for chemotherapy and radiation. My diet and mindset have completely changed and we are going straight ahead at this. I came home from the hospital on my oldest daughters 12th birthday- what a blessing that was to be home to celebrate with her.  Just two weeks before my diagnosis, my company had to go through lay-offs, and unfortunately I was on the receiving end of that cut. With word of the lay offs, I had been proactive in a job search and fortunately had a final interview set up in New York for a very good position with a great company.  As it turned out the Friday before my surgery I had to contact the person I was supposed to interview with and take my name out of the running. Going through any unplanned disruption in a career is a severe blow to a family of six, but coupled with the news on the 3rd of December, we knew that we needed to reach out to those who love and support us, and ask for some help. This was not easy for Aimee and me. But through many discussions we know that there are good people out there looking to help, people who have asked what they can do to help, so here we are. We are asking you to consider helping us financially; so we can get through some tough roads ahead.   There is a large financial component in our immediate future and your financial support would go to our medical and family costs. We have also decided that the best thing for our family is to pack up our house in Arizona and move to Washington where we have the support of family to help during these difficult times ahead.  Adding a move to our lives right now is a huge undertaking both financially and mentally, but we know it’s the right thing to do. I have been told after insurance, the costs are substantial.  I have already had over $100,000 worth of treatment expenses, and have been told to expect over $1 million in costs. We have been in touch with some doctors and people throughout the country who are helping us gain valuable information on how we can go at this aggressively. This includes traveling to different hospitals to see specialists for clinical trials that are out of state and very expensive. I also need to keep my current health insurance which is an important factor for me maintaining a great level of care, but the premiums are extremely high. Any contribution you can provide will help more than you know!  From the moment we got the news, Aimee and I believed there was a bigger reason that this was happening to our family. We do not question why, but say HOW are we going to use this to help others? I have had great satisfaction helping many people financially in my career, and to be a long-term cancer survivor I envision helping so many more! Our hope is that one day we will be sitting across from a family who has received devastating news as we did, and tell them that there is hope. We believe this with all of our hearts, and our faith has never been stronger. I am used to being on the giving side, but we find out life unfolds in ways we can never imagine. I am now in this role – one of needing and asking for help. I accept the fight and your help will allow me to cover heavy costs to do this. For those who are able to donate we will never be able to put into words how much we thank you. For those who aren’t able to donate, but hold us up in prayer we can’t thank you enough for that too. We are putting together a team to beat this, and we want every single person who reads our story to be on our team. It's a team that is dedicated to beating this, who believes in the win, and the glory that will come. We will pay this forward one day... it's our mission and we will not quit.  We remain faithful. We are blessed for each new day. We are strong. We are going to win… day by day we win each day! Thank you so much for your support and your prayers. The Staudt Family-Jeff, Aimee, Chloe(12), Madeleine(10), Frances(6), and Jack(4)WTD- “Win The Day”#wintheday",523307dd6502b071eae523227ad59c9e,47,0.7201,1110.0,6,1,general,0,10,0,5,0,0.010245901639344262,0.0,0.13151658767772512,21.08496499521049,0.0,gofundme

I am a recurrent osteosarcoma cancer survivor looking for money to help fund the medical expenses, travel fair, and lodging of an amazing study out at the University of California - Los Angeles. I am 26 with clear ambitions of what I want to do with my life, loved ones I would do anything for, and every reason to be here. My journey starts 10 years ago in 2006 when x-rays showed a mass growing in my lower tibia (shin bone) and pressing against my fibula. I remember leaving the doctor's office not knowing what this meant. I noticed that my mom was silently weeping, and I put an arm around her and told her, ""it's gonna be okay. We got this."" To be honest I didn't know what ""this"" was, but I knew right then that this journey wasn't about me alone: it's about my family, friends, dreams and ambitions, who I will become, and why it's worth it to go through hell to emerge victorious on the other side. Since that time I've had four relapses. I’ve undergone multiple chemo regiments, dozens of surgeries, both on my leg and on my lungs where the cancer eventually spread, and more adversity than a single person should have to go through. However, I've learned much about myself, why I believe I'm destined to be here, and what I can accomplish in this world.  Despite relapses, I received my undergraduate degree in Kinesiology and was accepted in the Doctorate of Physical Therapy program at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Because of my experiences, I have a passion to help others move and regain control of their bodies after injury, ailment, and disease just like the amazing physical therapists of my past retaught me how to walk, how to exercise, and showed me all the things I could do after my various leg surgeries. I can’t wait for the opportunity to give back to others and help them regain their movement abilities.Three semesters into my DPT courses, and four and a half years of no sign of disease, routine scans showed a tumor at the bottom of my right lung. I had surgery to remove the tumor, but a month later, five nodules popped up in its place. Since then we have explored and undergone many different treatment options. While some treatments were successful for a time, we need to seek state-of-the-art treatment to take care of the cancer for good.  The University of California – Los Angeles has an advanced study that uses my own modified cells to kill the cancer. It does this by engineering my cells to attack protein markers which my cancer highly expresses. While there are no guarantees in the medical world, we believe this is the missing link to curing my cancer. It is extremely difficult to get into these clinical trials and I am beyond fortunate that my cells, blood typing, and protein markers match perfectly with the study.Due to travel expenses, lodging, food, and the medical expenses, this treatment could cost 50,000 dollars or more. That is why I am looking for your help. This treatment is the next (and hopefully final) step in curing my cancer. I’m set to begin treatment December 12th of 2016, but will be asking for donations all December while I undergo my trial. Thank you so much for your love and generosity.I have much to do in this world, and my destiny is to be here for a long, long time. I look forward to the opportunity to get back to school, become a physical therapist where I can help people suffering from medical ailments as I have every day, marry my girlfriend, and so much more. Thank you to everyone who believes in me in these endeavors, my friends I have made along the way, and to those who can help me to reach my aspirations. I love you all so much, and couldn’t do it without you.-John KeimigTo read more about my story, visit my blog:   https://johnsdestructionofcancerplan.wordpress.com/2016/12/07/the-jist-of-it/",6762723641d90f0431d68c1e4838d658,29,0.6706,750.0,2,1,general,0,0,2,0,1,0.0,0.0028208744710860366,0.09521331945889698,0.0,2.0,gofundme

Anyone who has worked with Kate knows her dedication, her enthusiasm, her gift of giving, and her infectious laugh.  She can brighten any room the minute she walks in. Kate left QPS a few years ago to work as an investigator for Education NSW and to be closer to her family. In her new role, Kate again has served the people of NSW in the work she does, investigating complaints surrounding the abuse of children.  As a single mum of 3 year old son Max, Kate has found her happy place. There are a multitude of photos of Kate and her adorable Max on facebook all depicting a very happy little family living a very normal and busy life.However things changed very recently when Kate noticed a lump in her left breast in early December 2018.  She went to her GP who said it was unlikely to be cancer. Thankfully this doctor said “I don’t muck around with boobs” and Kate was very quickly referred for a mammogram and ultrasound.  Those scans showed that her GP was right, the lump Kate had felt wasn’t cancer, but another lump was found, but one which Kate could not feel. Later a biopsy showed it was cancer!!At that time the scans indicated the cancer was 1.1cm and at that size, Kate was told it wouldn’t have spread to the lymph nodes, and that after surgery she would only require radiation. But unfortunately that wasn’t to be the case as the cancer, once removed, was 3cm and the two biopsied lymph nodes showed .5 cm cancers in each of them.  This changed treatment drastically and Kate’s prognosis fell from 98% to 70% survival.Just last week Kate had a full lymph node removal, a far more significant operation and recovery.  She has had to obtain private treatment so far, as her GP couldn’t get her in to see a public surgeon until mid January (even with a diagnosis early in December).  Had Kate not had private health and some savings she may still have been waiting to see a surgeon. Where would that have left her?Anyway two surgeries later Kate is now recovering from the second surgery so that she is able to commence a 6 month treatment of chemotherapy.  All things going to plan Kate will hopefully starting treatment early/mid February. Once that is completed Kate needs 6 weeks of daily radiation followed by 5 years of hormonal treatment. This will bring on menopause and all those other fun symptoms!!Kate is now forced to take leave for most of 2019.  She does have income insurance, and will be paid 75% of her income, but as a part time worker (75% of 0.6), the reality is that she is going to really struggle financially.  The medication she needs as well as caring for Max and normal bills are more than she can manage. Her savings have been used to pay the excess of private health. Nothing comes cheaply these days.Max turns 3 this March and as a single mum Kate would be very grateful for any help, that people can provide.  We need to raise funds to take the pressure and worry away from Kate so that she can focus on her recovery, mothering, her treatments and getting well!!Please donate any amount you can to help Kate.",df4db750c6ae7d352aac984f026bd97a,28,0.3248333333333333,12.0,0,0,breast cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

The doctor was concerned that it could possibly be her gallbladder so he sent her for a CAT Scan. He came back and told her that they noticed 2 masses on her Liver and needed another CAT Scan with contrast. The doctor confirmed that she indeed did have 2 masses and was going to send her home and refer her to a specialist . On Monday, November 6th the specialist called and wanted to see her. She was told she had Stage 4 Colon Cancer that had metastasized to the Liver. Her whole world was turned upside down, we were NOT expecting that news.

That describes exactly the generosity and kindness demonstrated by all of those who contributed to Tigre's medical through the fundraiser and her transport to CT.  After fees, $2,721.55 has been raised. which should hopefully come close to covering the high end estimate and part of the cost of the additional films that were not included in the estimate but were needed to determine if the cancer had spread to her lungs. Thank you, everyone, for being so compassionate About two weeks ago now,  Tigre was transported from the Miami Dade Animal Shelter to my home in Connecticut. We had raised a significant amount of pledges for her through people in the various dog facebook groups, but she had no interest. Pleas were send out by MDAS to rescues but none stepped up for her. The next step for Tigre, who had been seized by Animal Control when they went to pick up the dead dog she had been living with for two and one half weeks because she was in such bad shape, would have been ""humane euthanization."" I could not let that happen to this senior girl.Tigre is being treated for a long standing yeast infection in both of her ears, so bad that the skin has toughened. She has a large area of bacterial infection on her chest. And,  she is  underweight. Her most serious issue is cancer of the the mammary glands on the right side of her belly. If these glands are not removed, just as in women with breast cancer, the cancer will most likely metastasize. In dogs, the most common area/organs to which mammary cancer metastasizes is in the chest. I have received an estimate from my vet for the removal of the glands. It is very high. I will post the estimate.  I am presently treating the yeast and bacterial infection and working to get Tigre's weight up. That is not difficult. I am not, however, in the financial position to pay the $2700 needed for the surgery. To forgo having it done means that in all likelihood the mammary cancer will spread. That cannot happen. She deserves a chance at a happy healthy life, especially after the horror and lack of care she endured at her previous owners. To have the surgery done, Tigre and I must rely on the kindness of dog loving strangers and friends.  As they say, it all adds up. The estimate for the surgery is indeed a very large amount  but if people will heed my plea and donate any amount possible, we might just get there.

The treatments have been keeping the Cancer at bay but this is a long-term fight.  Didi recently suffered an additional setback that resulted in the discovery of a brain tumor in which she had a very intense 5 hour brain surgery procedure.  We feel very blessed for the success of this surgery.  Modern medicine is amazing! But it took its toll on her and has led to follow-up focused radiation treatment.  In addition to the set back of her Brain Tumor, she lost her Kaiser insurance through Obama Care.  This delayed her continued treatment. She has since found new doctors and a new facility to administer her immunotherapy in Santa Cruz.  Didi continues to suffer from incapacitating headaches that have rendered her immobile. Her fight against Cancer has taken its toll on her ability to regularly work, keep up with the medical bills, and the cost of daily living.  Shannon, Didi’s husband has been working 6 days a week and doing what he can to keep things going but that isn't enough to cover the financial setbacks and ongoing medical costs.  They are both overwhelmingly grateful for the help they have received to date but, unfortunately, more is needed.Fighting this Cancer is a long-term battle. But with the help of friends and community, we are confident she can beat it!  So, with some convincing, Didi has finally accepted that it is time to reach out to all of her friends, family, and community. Didi is not only an asset to all of us who know her well, but she has always been kind, generous, and an inspiration to the greater community at large, including the homeless and the mentally ill.

Just before my 50th birthday I was scrolling Facebook and I saw an ad for an upcoming free breast cancer screening event at St Joseph Mercy Hospital. Being self-employed my insurance history was spotty and I had not yet had my first mammogram. I saw the ad and was inspired to sign up for the event. At that time, I was the first participant where cancer was found since the event began 4 years prior. It was truly a blessing and I know that I would not have had that screening or learned that I had breast cancer if I had not responded to that Facebook ad. I truly believe that I have been touched by God's grace. 2017 was a whirlwind a year. I had a lumpectomy where the cancer was removed and it was determined that it had not spread to the rest of my body. I underwent six weeks of radiation. In the fall of 2017 I began hormone suppression therapy. 2018 was a different story  Since I was uninsured at the time of my cancer diagnosis my husband and I are responsible for the bills that were incurred. St Joseph Mercy Hospital was generous in reducing our bill by 74% this still left a remaining $30,000 that we were responsible for. A payment plan was set up and we were able to make payments through most of 2018. Unfortunately, I did not respond well to the hormone suppression therapy. The side effects of the medications were crippling and as a direct result my income has decreased by more than 50% for the year 2018. The next steps for my health require trying a different course of hormone suppression medications. At the end of last year I honestly considered foregoing any further treatment in order to reduce our expenses. We are still waiting to see if our unsubsidized ACA bronze insurance plan will approve the new therapies.  I remain hopeful, I am in the palm of God's hand. It is with great humility that we ask for help.  I continue to work, I've been on a ""medication vacation"" since October and my energy levels have tripled. I'm working diligently and I've taken on a second job in order to stay afloat. My husband works every available shift, sometimes working 15 days straight with one day off. He is such an incredibly wonderful partner. It has been very difficult this last year feeling that I was unable to equally contribute.

Her name is Rita and she is the biggest sweetheart. Her favorite thing to do is play ball and cuddle anybody who will let her. She howls when she's excited and wants nothing but love and affection.

Rita was my boyfriend's dog. His name is Dane and he had her since the day she was born and she was the biggest daddy's girl you could ever meet. Unfortunately, Dane passed in July 2017 and I have taken it very hard. I have had anxiety and depression my entire life and when Rita and Dane came into my life, they made things better and loved me either way. She is the biggest support to me in ways I could never put into words. She has a way of calming me that I could not imagine life without.

I have been making sure Rita is happy and healthy since his passing, but she has now been diagnosed with liver cancer. Something that could not have been prevented unless I had done an ultrasound on her, which there was no sign indicating that she needed to have one done. The vet is confident that if she has the surgery, it will add years to her life. If she does not get the surgery, it's likely that she will pass away or need to be put down before the year is over. At any moment, she could start uncontrollable bleeding, which will either cause her death itself or force me to put her down. Rita is in every other way as healthy as can be and you can't even tell by looking at her that she has cancer. She shows me unconditional love and strength. 

I have put down two dogs this year (due to diseases) and lost my best friend since 4th grade just three weeks ago. I can not lose another love. Rita is my registered emotional support dog. I am begging you to help me raise money for her surgery. 

The surgery is about $3,500 but I am asking for $4,000  to help compensate for the fees that come with GoFundMe. She will also need ultrasounds every 3-6 months to make sure the tumour doesn't come back. So any additional donations are immensely appreciated as well and will be used towards her health. I have spent $1,000 in the last 24 hours to get her diagnosed and I am unable to afford any additional expenses. The surgery needs to be done as soon as possible so I have no way of trying to earn that money on my own.

Please help me take care of my babygirl and keep her here with me. She is always right by my side. I can't even use the bathroom without her wanting to be right at my feet. I can not imagine life without her.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

She is currently in the hospital and the plan is to move her to a hospice house where she can get 24 hour care. It kills me to do this since she hates hospitals, and Genevieve and I miss her terribly, but she is not safe at home anymore. I am in a no-win situation, but have to choose the lesser of two evils. I wish I had better news.”I’m posting this update on behalf of Tom & Jessica. I created this campaign last year for them, which has been incredibly helpful. As you may recall, with Jessica unable to work due to her cancer, they had to move to a smaller house. Last year’s donations were instrumental in letting them fix up their house to get ready to sell and to deal with all of the moving expenses. Unfortunately, as Tom has reported above, things have taken a turn for the worse for Jessica. She is now so weak, with vertigo, double-vision, and a host of other problems, that she can no longer live at home. As of this writing, she has been moved to hospice care. As you might imagine, Tom has had to take a lot of unpaid time off from work, and even with insurance, they are amassing a mountain of ridiculous medical bills.

She had surgery, and it was thought that the surgeons got everything.  Unfortunately, they recently learned that the cancer had metastasized into her spine, hips, lymph nodes and brain.  Although they are doing all they can, her prognosis is not favorable. Jessica currently has a lot of mobility issues, as well as nausea, dizziness and vertigo, so she can no longer drive. As a result, she has had to put aside her beloved landscaping career, so she and Tom are having much trouble making ends meet. They are definitely going to have to move to a smaller home, since they cannot afford their current one on Tom's income alone.  Of course, moving is not cheap. There are repairs that must be made before they put their home on the market and, despite insurance, the medical bills are piling up. They would rather not ask anyone for money, but they certainly need it.  Any amount is welcome, and they will certainly not think less of anyone who can't give at this time. They know they have the best friends in the world, and help doesn't always come in the form of money. You may give anonymously if you so choose. Please share this as much as you can.

These last few months have been nothing less than a parent's worst nightmare. Mike & Becky's only child MJ was just diagnosed with bone cancer. This comes shortly after Becky was let go from her job of 19+years, leaving them to solely rely on Cobra Insurance Coverage that ends in 16 months time and runs $2200 a month. No parent should ever have to worry about the cost of their child's medical expenses.

We would also like to ask you to share this page with your family and friends...church groups, etc. Becky & Mike are the kind of people who will go out of their way to help friends and strangers alike. Let's join together and be there for Becky, Mike and MJ. ￼MJ's Last Few Months (shared by his mom Becky) In mid/late October 2017 MJ was experiencing pain in his thigh that got progressively worse throughout each day and then started fresh the next morning. Eventually it reached the point that even when lying down, he was in excruciating pain - literally screaming. That night even though we felt silly we took him to a standalone ER for thigh pain. I told her that he had a fever before we came if that was relevant and she said he did not have a fever, that body temp goes up at night. They moved his hip around, did an X-ray, and reported that they couldn't see any issues causing the pain. They offered a CT scan and blood work but said the CT scan would be a lot of radiation and if it were something that would be caught on a CT scan there would be other symptoms. So we agreed not to do the CT scan but I requested blood work. The doctor said that if we weren't doing to CT Scan there was no reason to do blood work. So we were released and told to follow up with our pediatrician, which we did the next day. Our pediatrician checked MJ over and since she didn't find anything concerning she ruled the problem to be small muscle tears. She told him to take it easy. The pain did pass in a few days, for about a week, but then returned. We called the pediatrician who referred us to an orthopedic doctor. The ortho moved him around, took an X-ray, and said it happened because he needed to stretch before physical activities, and diagnosed him with tendinitis of the knee (yes knee?). After a week or two of no improvement and in fact worse pain, and after multiple calls to the ortho asking if they were sure, they referred us to physical therapy. We owe so much to the physical therapist. It was fairly obvious to me that she knew something more serious was wrong throughout her examination. When she finished her evaluation she tactfully told us that there was something more going on and that we needed to go back to our doctors for more scans and blood work. So the next day she called the ortho for us and we called the pediatrician. We went to three appointments that day. Pediatrician, blood work (ordered by pediatrician), and the ortho. The ortho took another X-ray, charged me for my visit (yes I'm bitter) and told me he wasn't qualified to help us because he saw nothing wrong and 'sees kids who have sports injuries'. So he referred us to a better ortho - the best pediatric ortho in Dallas. The new ortho got us in the next day (Friday). He ordered an MRI which we had Saturday and he reviewed it over the weekend. He called Sunday night and told us MJ had infection in his pelvic bone and that he would need to operate within the week. He operated the first time on 12/20 (Wednesday). They took cultures but nothing (no bacteria) ever grew in the lab. MJ slowly improved following surgery, but 10 days later (12/30) he had a night of terrible pain that woke him from sleep and couldn't be managed. We were out of town so went to an ER under our Ortho's instruction and had blood work and an ultrasound. Blood work hadn't improved so they changed our oral antibiotic but ultrasound looked normal. MJ started using his crutches 100% of the time and after not using the leg for a week or so it felt a little better but if he moved to much it resulted in hours of crying. Still nothing growing in the lab. After returning home we had a follow up appointment and did blood work to check infection markers - they were WORSE not better. So the doctor ordered another MRI which we did the next afternoon. The doctor called about 2 hours after the MRI to tell us the infection in the pelvic bone was worse/bigger than when he operated. We had to go back into the operating room for the same procedure THAT NIGHT. It was much more aggressive/invasive and he was in a lot of pain. They took more cultures but again, nothing grew in the lab. They put in a PICC line so he could get IV antibiotics at the hospital and then eventually at home for 6 weeks. Unfortunately a couple days later he was back in terrible pain in his thigh that caused moaning and screaming for long periods of time. Another MRI showed that he had infection/an abscess in his right thigh. Enter his 3rd surgery in a month on 1/20. More fluid taken for culture, but again nothing grew in the lab. Walking was limited to 25-50 steps and every time he got out of bed it resulted in an hour or more of terrible pain. He got mildly better and we were released on Wednesday 1/24 to home health. Home was hard too. He might be fine for hours but if he had to crutch-it to the bathroom it would result in hours of writhing in pain and often fever. Tuesday 1/30 returned disappointing blood work and Wednesday 1/31 we had another MRI. The next day we had a follow up appointment at his office. When he came in MJ was on the table crying in pain. He asked us to come back into the hospital to operate in the pelvic bone again. MJs 4th surgery was 2/1. They took a ton of bone and fluid and tissue so that they could rule things out and hopefully finally identify the root cause. MJ continued to have terrible pain. We all thought it was from the surgery but it got worse not better. His pain in his thigh was/is unbearable. They went through all the most powerful pain medications and nothing worked for more than a few minutes. He can't walk and can barely stand. And now I come to (believe it or not) the worst part of MJs tale. The surgeon came to us last night (2/5) and asked if we wanted him to speak in front of MJ or in private. I already knew the news would be unbearable. He started with the fact that there was more/new infection in the right thigh and some also in the left visible from yet another MRI that morning. He would probably have to operate again. But he hadn't gotten to the worst part. The pathology lab had returned results. Yes they saw inflammation in the bone (indicating infection), but also ""Small round blue cell tumor"" cells. We don't get know for sure which 'flavor' of cancer (yes, I just said that MJ has cancer). Our amazing orthopedic surgeon thinks it is one from a short list: Lymphoma of bone, Ewing's sarcoma, or PNET. He said it's aggressive, and its life threatening. And we can assume that if he had these cells in his pelvic bone that they are in all of his bones. We are moving to a Dallas hospital with an oncology department in the morning, and plan to get a second opinion regarding the plan to heal him either in Houston or New York. It's our understanding that for this rare form of cancer those are the most qualified hospitals.

When he isn't ill, he never hesitates to answer a page.  He is also very passionate about his lighting designs.  He loves his jobs and the people he works with.   We need to raise funds for Erik to beat this cancer and to get his liver transplant.   He is usually the first to arrive at the cancer center and the last one to leave on chemo days.  He will be starting radiation 2 times a day which is a lot for three and a half weeks. The liver transplant is unbelievably expensive and a lifelong  endeavor.  There are medicines he will be required to take that are very expensive every day of life so his body won't reject his new liver.  We strive to live one day at a time.  Unforunately, we do know we have to raise money for these medical bills, which means planning ahead. I've been learning to accept help from others. I am so grateful.  We are especially thankful for everyone's prayers!!Any donation will be tremendously appreciated.  All we want is for Erik to beat this cancer and have a successful liver transplant.  His goal he shared with his transplant social worker was simple, ""I want to see my girls grow up.""Our beautiful little girls need him to reach his goal.  Erik brings something to this family that no one else can.

Our beautiful Mum Barbara, who everyone knows and loves as Barb, has been shocked by the diagnosis that she has Oesophageal Cancer - Stage 4 which is an aggressive and incurable form of Cancer. Barb is the most caring, loving person who loves to chat and always has a smile on her face and would do anything for anyone. We are all deeply saddened by this news and are asking for your urgent help. Whether it be donations, kind words or prayers, it will all be deeply appreciated from Barb and the Pavez family. We (Bianca, Suzy and Daniel) are running this campaign for our amazing mum to take some of the financial pressures off our family as she goes through this fight with cancer. You might be wondering what Oesophagael Cancer is - the oesophagus is a long, muscular tube that connects your mouth to your stomach. Barb has a large tumour at the bottom of the Oesophagus which stopped her from having the ability to eat and drink and caused her extreme discomfort, pain and vomiting on a daily basis. Oesophagael Cancer originates from GERD disease, which is a form of acid reflux that can form into Cancer. It has no screening detection method, upsettingly only showing symptoms of the Cancer in it’s advanced stages and usually too late for any cure. Barb’s Cancer has spread to her lymph nodes and metastasized to her stomach. More info on Oesophagael Cancer can be found here:  https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/oesophageal-cancer/ After many extensive tests before and during her hospital admission for a period of 2 weeks they were finally able to locate the Primary Tumour in the Oesophagus through an endoscopy. In December, Barb then had an operation to have an Oesophagael stent inserted to allow her to eat and drink. Unfortunately the stent had little to no effect. After being told the Cancer is incurable, she was offered 3 rounds of chemotherapy to try and prolong the time she has left but she has only been able to tolerate one. The chemo has left her extremely unwell and has further affected her immune system leaving her prone to infection and ongoing side effects of constant nausea, pain and vomiting and a further 2 hospital admissions. Barb has also had an extreme weight loss with the aggressiveness of this Cancer. She has dramatically lost 33kg over 3 months and still is losing weight daily. We have now been advised by oncologists that there is no further treatment available other than anti-nauseating drugs and steroids. The doctors have told us that the prognosis of time left is unknown due to the Terminal Cancer being so unpredictable it could be months or fingers crossed year/s. Barb is using alternate medications to combat the Cancer to alleviate pain and discomfort of nausea and the other effects. She is now at home with family under the care of the Palliative Care team.This GoFundMe page has been set up by her children/ family to help cover extra costs associated around alternative medicines, transport and other unforeseen costs associated with mum’s Cancer. Even though mum loves her work and is missing it immensely, her focus right now is solely on her quality of life and spending it with family and friends. Any donation big or small would really help ease some of the financial pressure in what is already a difficult time. If you are personally unable to donate, sharing this page on Facebook will also help us greatly.Your kind messages will also go a long way to help mum focus only on her recovery, so we welcome your thoughts and prayers in the comments below. We will also use this page to update you on the latest with Barb.If you would like to share your stories about any successful Cancer cures please do so below.Thank you for your support xoBianca, Suzy and Daniel

An avid 42 year old crossfitter, he brags about beating the “young bucks” in the Workout of the Day (WOD). He listens to nutrition podcasts, always eager to try to latest diet or supplement. He ran a half marathon in August. But after the October wildfires, he noticed he had difficulty breathing that wasn’t clearing up. By November, the young bucks were passing him up and when the medical insurance for his new job started on December 1, he went to the Kaiser expecting antibiotics for pneumonia. The chest x-ray raised concerns, and he was sent for a CT scan on Saturday, the 2nd.On Monday, the 4th,  I joined him at a follow up appointment with a respiratory doctor. As he showed us the CT scan, he said we should prepare ourselves. This looks like cancer. They are words that no one can prepare you for, that literally knock the wind out of you. He showed us the dark void in his right lung, which was halfway full of fluid. This explained the difficulty breathing. The Dr. offered to drain the fluid, a liter of it was removed there in the office. He sent it for testing. On Wednesday the 6th, we got the dreaded call. The fluid tested positive for cancer. With our 3 children, we hugged; we cried; our world was crashing in around us. Daddy has cancer. That night was the start of many difficult phone calls, through tears, in shock, helping your friends and loved ones cope with the news you have barely even begun to process yourself. Cancer. F Cancer.On Monday the 11th, we met with the oncologist. She explained that the blood work on his lung fluid appeared “disorganized”, meaning she could not yet determine the type of cancer, in order to set a treatment plan. She said the CT scan showed nodules in both lungs, a mass behind his chest plate and something in his abdomen, by which she deemed this stage 4. “It’s considered incurable”, she said. “Our goal is extending life.” Perhaps that is your goal doctor, but Matt is a fighter and our God is able! She scheduled a Biopsy, for Wednesday the 13th, of the mass for further testing. The surgery went fine, but by Thursday, the right lung was filling up again. His oncologist ordered surgery for a permanent drain to be placed in his lung, to remove the pleural fluid that she expected to continue to accumulate. This would minimize the risk of infection from constant piercing of his lung to drain. But, despite constant phone calls, he could not be scheduled for Friday. We were told to go to the ER to have it drained. This time they took a liter and a half. His blood count dropped. We had to stay for another blood count check in 2 hours, in case of internal bleeding. Off to Safeway for organic produce and oatmeal pouches. Blood count is up, we’re outta here! Praise God!Since the fluid had been removed, the drain surgery had to be put off until Thursday. On Wednesday the 20th Matt had a PET scan which illuminates the areas of the body where the cancer is found. We would get the results from Oncology the next day, prior to drain surgery. Thursday morning, we learned the biopsy revealed the same “disorganized cell” result. It was not a tumor behind his chest plate, but a thickening of the lining of his lung. Amen! She would send the tissue for further testing, but was able to determine that Matt has a form of Mesothelioma, a cancer linked to asbestos exposure. So that’s how a non-smoker gets lung cancer. PET scan results show the cancer is contained within his lungs. Amen, AMEN!Off to surgery to place the drain. About thirty minutes later, I’m called into recovery. That was fast?! Matt smiles, as he removes his gown. Where’s the drain? “Not enough fluid in there!”, he said. “Rescheduled to next Wednesday.” Praise God! Prayers, the Gerson method, CBD oil, alkaline water, rest and more prayer. He’s feeling better. His body is healing. God is Good!Today is 12/27 and Matt just rescheduled today’s drain surgery to Friday. He is breathing well and hopes to cancel Friday’s surgery. Tomorrow, we have a phone appointment with the oncologist, hopefully for a clear result on his diagnosis and treatment plan. Then a 2nd opinion on Friday. This is the raw, honest window into our December, 2017. We have started our journey as a family to heal Matt’s cancer. Jesus said “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” Matt and I have had the privilege to personally hold events raising thousands for those in need and friends battling cancer. Now it is time to focus our efforts on Matt’s care. Now we humbly ask for your support. To those who have asked “how can I help?”, we ask this: pray, donate, share.Pray for God to remove the cancer from Matt’s body. Pray that the fluid remain at bay. Pray for full healing, for God’s glory. Donate what you can. The reality is that fighting cancer is costly, and we are battling on all possible fronts, but we need your help. We have spent over $1500 in medical expenses this month so far. In order to give Matt the best results from the Gerson therapy, we will need to purchase a Norwalk juicer, which is $2400. Monthly organic produce is estimated at $1000 and supplements will be several hundred more per month. New employees don’t qualify for short term disability, so there may be living expenses as well, depending on how Matt tolerates his treatment. Your generosity will bless us beyond measure and give Matt the fighting chance he needs to beat cancer. Share this post, with a few words about how Matt has touched your life. We thank you and we love you. Matt is willing, God is able, and with your support, we will prevail.

We are an adaptable family who have endured obstacles before. The father is a 14 year Technical Sergeant in the United States Air Force, with intentions of finishing his career with the military. Stephanie is 16 years old, enjoys spending time with friends, playing music, making arts and crafts, crocheting, and cooking. Tristan is 10, enjoys sports, playing Fortnite, playing with the family dog, and showing no fear when riding roller coasters at amusement parks.   In October of 2016, Stephanie was diagnosed with Stage II Hodgkin's lymphoma. She required 4 rounds of chemotherapy and quickly entered remission. Most of the appointments were outpatient, and was seen as a dramatic, but brief, obstacle to defeat.   Only 2 weeks before Christmas of 2017, Stephanie was in for a routine checkup and the doctors discovered that she developed Acute Myloid Leukemia (AML). This is a secondary cancer, which was caused by her chemotherapy while being treated for her Hodgkins. She was given a 50%-60% chance of survival.   Leukemia can multiply very rapidly, and Stephanie had to enter treatment within 48 hours in order to ward off the leukemia. Each round of chemo requires 3 weeks of inpatient hospitalization, with up to 7 days off afterwards. Thankfully, after only the first round of chemo, she was able to enter remission. This increases her chances of survival significantly. She has recieved 2 more rounds of chemo to maintain her remission status. AML will return if she does not get a bone marrow transplant. Transplant adds another 6-8 weeks in the hospital. This is where things get tricky. Prior to the transplant, her body will undergo intense chemotherapy like she has never seen before. This type of chemo has a high chance of permanately damaging her eggs. This is a tough decision to put onto a 16 year old girl, but she has chosen to freeze her eggs in hopes of being able to have kids in the future. Health insurance does not cover any of the IVF costs and is completely out of pocket.    There are several other expenses.  Transportation costs have reached almost $150 weekly while Stephanie is in the hospital, with the father trying to visit Stephanie during the day, and maintaining a home for his son at night. Toll road fees and parking fees are over half of the transportation costs.

My sister, Sandy, knew something was seriously wrong, but was dismissed and even blamed by doctors. It wasn’t until March that Emilia was, finally, formally diagnosed with Pediatric Acute Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS), an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation of the brain and psychiatric symptoms. Already feeling exhausted and desperate for relief, on the 4th of July they received the most horrific news yet; their child has cancer. Emilia was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, which is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow.  She is now undergoing chemo and steroid treatment and her PANS symptoms are intensifying the struggle. We are heartbroken and angry, but will stop at nothing to fight for our little mama. We trust that Emilia will return to her silly little self, but the journey toward remission has only just begun. Now on top of everything else that has been going on for the past several months, we found out at the end of September,  that poor little Emilia has severe mold toxicity. She will have to undergo a long term detox to hopefully remove the carcinogenic mold that has been triggering her PANS. That being said, the expenses just quadrupled as the family had to immediately be removed from their home and get rid of a majority of household contents due to the mycotoxins that get stored in porous materials. Although our family is strong, Sandy and Mark, a military family, could use your help. Their lives have been turned upside down. They have faced this terrifying reality with courage and have vowed to do whatever it takes to get Emilia through this. While Sandy has admirably persevered through the anguish of the illness, she has been unable to work for months. As funds were already tight for this family due to the extreme cost of homeopathic medicine and dietary restrictions for Emilia, the medical bills are reaching unthinkable amounts. Your donations will allow Sandy and Mark to focus their energy on providing the high level of care that Emilia needs. Your donations will cover costs for co-insurance payments for the weekly procedures Emilia needs over the next two years, the out-of-network physicians for her PANS and Mold Specialist (that charges $400/hour), prescription medication co-pays, homeopathic medications/supplements, specialized testing not covered by insurance,  and neuro-cognitive support to mitigate some of the effects the chemotherapy has had on her brain. Donations will also help support rebuilding their lives by funding their temporary housing, mold remediation along with allowing them to purchase the necessary items that they have lost. I genuinely thank you from the bottom of my heart for your generosity! Together, we will win this battle! Please keep our family in your thoughts and prayers.If you cannot make a donation, please share this post, so we can generate as much support as possible. Emilia's full story and updates can be found at: https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/emiliaerwin",03523280bb2be291c21937de74ed049a,23,0.46915,150.0,3,1,leukemia,0,3,1,3,1,0.005758157389635317,0.0019193857965451055,0.2782884310618067,4.85227544224403,1.0,gofundme

Two days before Thanksgiving, Paul drove himself to the ER, was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, and underwent a battery of tests. A cancerous mass was discovered. In the weeks leading up to his hospitalization, Paul endured sleepless nights, a constant urge to pee, severe weight loss, and feelings of hopelessness. Paul knew something was wrong, but was putting off getting medical help. Why? Because he is self-employed, his health insurance had lapsed, and he was waiting for his new medical insurance, California Care, to kick-in on January 1,  2019. Paul didn't make it to January 1.  Instead, he spent 5 days, including Thanksgiving Day, in the hospital after trying to tough-it-out on his own.  Knowing he had no health insurance, and because Paul is a fighter, he tried to manage the pain, infection, and invasive mass on his own.  Today he is living with a stent to relieve pressure on his kidneys, a nephrostomy tube to collect urine, a fistula connecting his colon and bladder, and a cancerous mass pressing on his bladder.  Surgery to remove the mass, repair damage to the colon, and hopefully reconstruct the bladder is planned for early January.  So far, hospital and doctors’ fees have totaled more than $20K. We don't know the full extent of procedures that lay ahead, nor do we know the extent to which Paul's new health insurance will cover these expenses, including chemotherapy and follow-up treatments.   Paul is a Veteran, serving in the US Marines from 1984-1988 and working on F-4 and F-18 Aircraft.  He grew up in Southborough, MA and is 1 of 8 children to John T. Mahoney, Jr. and Jacqueline (Trudeau) Mahoney. Since riding cross-country on his bicycle in his early-20's, Paul has spent most of his adult life in the San Diego area. Paul lives alone with his young teenage children and, although their mother lives nearby and is very involved, he's been trying to maintain a normal home routine for Zoe (14) & Liam (13) while managing his own computer technology company, and dealing with his failing health. It's been a struggle.   Paul gives and gives and gives to others. Now it's our turn to give to Paul.

And family means no one gets left behind.” - Lilo & StitchCALLING ALL OF THEO'S FIGHTING OHANA!!!!!!!!!!On Wednesday, April 18th, 2018 Theodore “Theo” Nathaniel Hucks was born with a rare pediatric cancer. If this rare diagnosis has proven anything, it’s that our Theo truly is one-in-a-million. Please donate, share, send a prayer, spread the word and join us in his ongoing road to recovery!THEO'S FIGHT AGAINST RARE PEDIATRIC CANCER:Shortly after Theo was born, the amazing doctors at St. Joseph’s hospital in Tampa, Florida noticed that he was having trouble breathing and swallowing. Several tests, an ultrasound and an MRI later revealed a large tumor extending from the base of his skull to his collar bone pressing on his trachea compromising his ability to breathe. At just two days old, Super Theo and his team of Super doctors went through an emergency and grueling 8+ hour life-saving surgery (that went until 9pm!!!) to remove as much of the tumor as possible. After many tests and a consult with an expert on the West coast, Theo was diagnosed with primary cervical neuroblastoma (a very rare pediatric cancer). The next 65 days of Theo's life were a blur of two additional major surgeries, countless MRIs, x-rays and constant prodding and poking. Shortly after he turned two months old, he got the green light and got his first breath of non-hospital fresh air!!!WHAT'S NEXT:Although the doctors were able to successfully remove almost all of the tumor during surgery, now the REAL work begins. Theo suffered major damage from both the tumor and the 8+ hour surgery resulting in paresis of his left vocal cord and diaphragm, muscle weakness on the left side of his body and the inability to take any food orally. Prior to leaving the hospital, a gastric tube was surgically placed to ensure Theo received proper nutrition. Each week he attends up to 6 doctors appointments including physical therapy, feeding therapy and more. Every three months he will also undergo anesthesia for an MRI to carefully scan and make sure his cancer has not returned. HOW YOU CAN HELP:Even with Theo's brighter prognosis, there's still a long and uncertain road ahead filled with an influx of medical bills and continued therapy. Theo's Mom, Mandy, has taken on the role of his full-time caretaker due to his extensive weekly doctor's appointments and thus can longer contribute monetarily to the household. Our hope is that this GoFundMe page can help prepare Mandy and Warren, bring them peace and prayers and let them focus as much of their attention as they can on their sons Theo, Colton (5) and Nolan (3).Each and every person that joins us on this journey will forever be a part of our family.

On the worst day of our life, (March 28, 2016), my brother Farhad was diagnosed with blood cancer (Acute Myeloid Leukemia).  After finding out about the doctor’s devastating news, Farhad showed pure bravery and positive attitude, giving hope to his wife (Azin) and pulling up all the family members together. So far, he has undergone three different chemotherapy treatments, none of which have been successful. His doctors are now suggesting clinical trials as a promising approach.  Farhad is a phenomenal, devoted father to his two year old daughter, Tina,  and his amazing wife, Azin. He has dedicated himself to his family and his community. He has been an active blood donor since his arrival to Vancouver back in 2010. It was just a few weeks after his diagnosis that his colleagues at RBC were inspired  by his caring and generous soul and showed their support by donating blood to the Canadian Blood Service (CBS). When he last gave blood in October 2015, he never thought that in six months time he would receive the live-giving transfusion of O+ blood, nearly every week from March until now. Farhad and his family have a long and hard road ahead of them. Farhad is hoping to find a clinical trial lab somewhere in the world to undergo newly developed drugs and possible intense radiation over the next few months. Farhad has not been able to work since his diagnosis day and will not be able to work for at least a year. His loving wife, Azin is taking time off work to be with Farhad through treatment and recovery. At the same time, Azin is also caring for their daughter – adding extra pressure on the entire family. This has put their family under immense financial and mental pressure that is only adding to the severity of the situation.  We want to raise enough funds to cover their living expenses and unknown costs. Hoping to take all financial stress away, so they can focus on Farhad’s recovery and health. Every little bit helps. Thank you all so much for your love, prayers, and support.

He had even started his own bait manufacturing business with the help of a government grant he received.Fast forward to today…17 year old Dustin is most comfortable spending  most of each day in the dark, on his bed, in silence.Early this year, Dustin was diagnosed with an EXTREMELY rare type of brain cancer, a rosette-forming glioneuronal tumour, which occurs predominantly in young adults.  There are only about 45 known cases world-wide.  There is no cure, and traditional forms of treatment are not an option and prove ineffective.Dustin’s neuro-oncologist in Winnipeg reached out to cancer research facilities world-wide for help.  Two experimental drug treatments were developed, one by a pharmaceutical company in Japan, the other by the Mayo Clinic.  The first drug was offered to Dustin at no cost.  However, the cost for the second drug is approximately $3,000 every 2 weeks, a total nearing $30,000.  Although Dustin’s Mom, Lynda Moncrief, has fought tirelessly on his behalf to have the drug publically funded, to date this has not happened.  To further add to their difficulties, Lynda and Dustin travel to Winnipeg on a weekly basis sometimes staying overnight, for medical appointments, and treatment.  Consequently, Lynda has been unable to work since early this year, as she continues to provide care and support for Dustin. Dustin decided to learn as much as he could about the beast that was affecting his brain and body function.  His research discovered a neurosurgeon in Mississauga who has performed a successful surgery on a young woman with the same type of tumour.  Dustin reached out to this specialist, and the two have corresponded about Dustin’s case, including sharing of Dustin’s MRI’s and medical files.Last week, the decision was made by Dustin’s neuro-oncologist in Winnipeg to stop the drugs that Dustin has been receiving.  He has been experiencing issues with his liver, his sight and increased dizziness…whether these are symptoms of the tumour or side effects from the drugs is unknown.Dustin’s hope now lies with the surgery, in Mississauga.   The past months have pushed Lynda physically, emotionally and financially to the limit.  As hard as it is for Lynda to ask for financial help, given her humble nature and her desire to provide for her son, on her own, she has realized that she can’t do it alone.  Help is needed as they prepare to travel for this risky but hopefully life-saving surgery, and whatever else they may have to face in the coming months.  Given this, Lynda and Dusty have agreed to let us share their story.  Please join Team Dustin and help support Dustin and Lynda.  Any donation will be accepted in Lynda and Dustin’s way, with humble gratitude and much appreciation.",b81af7f150b032f4a2f558582e789eae,20,1.1534166666666668,120.0,0,0,brain cancer,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

I’ve been battling constant pain and symptoms in the form of debilitating migraines, seizures, TIAs, aphasia, vertigo, nausea and endured six weeks of Radiotherapy that gave no relief. We’ve been working on pain and seizure management and the far too common practice with a tumor of ‘wait and see’. Unfortunately the routine annual scan on 10.01.18 showed gross abnormalities of the tumor. This resulted in a needle biopsy the following day. The pathology report was shared on 10.10.18 with markers showing the brain stem glioma as malignant. Average Survival: 15 -18 months; as gaged by my markers with conventional treatment.  I’m still trying to wrap my mind around this. It is impossible; this can’t be real. And while statistics are against me, it hasn’t changed my determination to find a way to be the exception. The side effects of SOC (conventional treatment) will decrease my quality of life and not give a longer life expectancy. I need a long term treatment, something that is going to give me hope and quality of life. I REFUSE TO GIVE UP!Due to current FDA restrictions in the US, I’ve been referred for full Immunotherapy Treatment at clinics worldwide that are having incredible results.  (Wait listed for trials in the US) Using the Dendritic cell vaccine which is cultured specifically to me by using my own blood, it boosts my own immune system to eliminate/stabilize the tumor and is completely noninvasive.  Clinics have patients with my diagnosis still alive 8+ years later and I am in direct contact with many who are doing incredibly well with multiple stable scans. The downside to this is the huge cost that it involves.  It is just a rough estimate without travel costs and current basic cost of living. After the initial intense regime of 4 weeks to get the tumor stable, the vaccine is then administered 4 more times spread out 6 - 8 weeks apart. So the travel to and from the clinic, the loss of complete income and the basic cost of living while doing this is what we are up against. All of this is so promising though and I have to believe this IS within reach!! I’m so excited by the possibility of remaining here with my daughter.  My goal is to simply stay alive for her!Zoë is just shy of her Sweet Sixteen. She is the joy and love that keeps my heart beating.  I need the chance to guide her and help her through this world.

Zoë is my baby girl and would be completely lost without me. It’s just the two of us - our bond is more than I ever could have hoped for.  I may not be good at anything at all, but I am so proud of the young woman Zoë has become .... and I did that. I have so much more to give and share with her. She deserves more time .... this would break her.  Asking for help is so difficult. However I can’t do this on my own.  I will continue to be completely transparent and share everything implemented along the way.  My mindset is strong. I’m fighting this and I refuse to leave Zoë motherless and alone.  Thank you for your love and support as my journey continues.  I believe I can and will beat this! With love and immense gratitude, Michel xx",380bbfad850c115181dd34482a662859,40,0.315725,210.0,0,1,general,0,2,1,2,1,0.0030581039755351682,0.0015290519877675841,0.9421557562076749,3.1394239830508455,1.0,gofundme

He bravely endured radiation and other forms of treatment however by the end of 2018 it had spread to his spine,  left shoulder, his ribs and his lung. Richard and Kirsty have shown extreme strength during these months but times are becoming tough and this fight is getting harder. He has currently been admitted to hospital and Kirsty and the boys are experiencing the biggest struggle of their life and they need OUR help. They would never ask for help so it is up to us to step in and try and make life right now and leading into the unknown a little easier. With a broken heart we have to accept the diagnosis is terminal. If that is not bad enough Kirsty is still continuing to work to support the family whilst still caring for Richard and the boys while her heart breaks. Richard and Kirsty are very well know in the local community especially working within the junior rugby league association including Penrith juniors and Coltyton football club. They have given countless hours of their time to support our youth and given money and raised money to drive the football club. NOW is our time to give back. Our aim is to raise enough money to pay some basic living expenses in hope that Kirsty can take some leave from work to be with Richard and the boys during this time and to hopefully assist in preparations for costs the family will sadly face in the near future when the unimaginable time comes.

Anyone who knows her knows the fun spirited, kindness, hard work, and strength she exudes as a person. She is a devout follower of Jesus and mother above all else. What I have also come to learn is this isn’t an anomaly in her family; strength, hard work, determination, and kindness are traits that run deep. These qualities radiate in the unbreakable bond Tesheka and her sister Tiffany have with one another and have instilled in their daughters Wysdom and Zyon. They all share a unique connection that is unlike any other. Befriending someone on Facebook allows you a glimpse into their lives, anyone connected with Tiffany and Tesheka are able to share in the sweet little life of Zyon. She has an adorable, fun loving, joyful sweet soul. The videos of Zyon from a young age singing, dancing, and praising the Lord bring a smile to anyone who views them. To say she is a special little girl is an understatement. She is a super hero for Christ and embodies the special qualities her mother and aunt have instilled in her. As I watch these videos I can’t help but think we can all learn from Zyon’s love for life and Jesus, it is pure and sincere.   Not only do Tesheka and Tiffany raise their daughters together, but they do so in Chicago where life isn’t always easy and has a unique set of obstacles. I have always admired how Zyon and Wysdom are still able to be kids, their mothers have worked very hard to ensure their girls maintain their childlike innocence. Yet no matter how hard you fight as a mother to provide for and protect your children, get them the best education, and keep them from harm’s way, there is nothing that can prepare or protect your child from illness. Last week I received a text message from Tesheka about Zyon that rocked me to my core. I can’t begin to imagine how scared, sad, angry, every range of emotion Tiffany and Tesheka must be feeling right now. Sweet little 8 year old Zyon was taken to urgent care not feeling well and immediately sent to the ER. The next day a rigorous series of tests were run and Zyon has been diagnosed with stage 3 Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL is extremely aggressive form of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma Cancer.  Zyon will undergo chemo treatments at minimum over the next 5 months. Compounding this issue Tiffany is working as a contractor and in between insurance. Nothing about this is fair, it sucks, it is expensive, time consuming, and shouldn’t happen to anyone- especially an amazing God loving little girls like Zyon and an amazing mother like Tiffany. No amount of planning can prepare you for such a horrible situation. Yet in the midst of turmoil, Zyon is joyful and fearless in her faith, she believes God has already healed her! Once again she is teaching everyone around her how to love God and have faith like a mustard seed or a small child faced with a difficult uphill battle most of us couldn’t begin to handle. No one is immune to adversities no matter how hard we work or try, it can happen in an instant, our worlds can be completely rocked and flipped on end, but it is times like this WE must show strength and rally around our friends and family. Like Zyon, I too have an amazing mother who taught me from a young age when you are faced with a situation where you can help someone in need- you do it. We never know when we will be confronted with an issue of own. Tiffany and Tesheka now find themselves in the beginning of a serious storm, an emotional rollercoaster that seems unbearable, and a financial burden many of us have never experienced. When a child is ill money should be the last thing a parent must worry about; doctor bills, travel, meals, parking, missed work; it all adds up very quickly! Thank Jesus for a website like Gofundme where we can come together and provide a blessing to our friends in need. At the end of the day it takes a village. Now is that time. I am asking you to give, give generously, and as often as you can. No amount is too small. We need little girls like Zyon to grow up, healthy and strong to show the rest of the world how to love.

All who know Sandy are well aware of her tenacity and zest for life. Initially she was told she had six months to two years...but they didn't know her at the time. she has no plan of leaving this life gently or quietly. She is a fighter. I, more than most, know this to be true because Sandy and I have been through the best and worst life has thrown at us for over half a century! She now needs our help-she need practical help more than just supportive prayers and encouraging words.Sandy and her amazingly courageous husband, Dick, are both retired and live on a very fixed income. The medical expenses for treatments are  putting a healthy strain on their diminishing savings. When I first  mentioned a GoFundMe account, Sandy immediately pushed back saying she could never ask for financial ""charity"". I assured her that EVERYONE who knows her wants to know, ""how can I help-what can I do? This is how you can help and what you can do! Help with medical expenses!  Sandy has chemo every three out of four weeks. There are regular CT scans, PET scans and MRI's.  She is on Medicare, which does partially cover a portion of the expenses. On average the ""out of pocket"" costs Sandy in the neighborhood of $800-1100 on a monthly basis. When discussing the goal for this campaign, it was challenge for Sandy to ask at all for any amount so I came up with a goal.  ANY amount you might feel motivated to give would be greatly appreciated to hopefully meet this goal. This would take some of the stress  off meeting financial demands that cannot be avoided. I want her to focus on fighting as hard as she can for as long as she can and not worry about the financial part of all this battle! Sandy and Dick are the best kind of people, MANY will attest to that fact! We know life is not ""fair"" but this seems off the charts wrong!

I'm turning 58 this year so I was a little late, but finally I had insurance to cover it. I had been having symptoms of fatigue for years, but just thought it was menopause. What spurred me to get in finally, was that I started having bowel symptoms and shortness of breath.As I was coming out from under the propofol, my doctor appeared and said they had found a 3 cm mass in the rectum, quite near the sphincter. He apologetically explained that although he couldn't be sure, he thought it was cancerous, but we wouldn't know for sure until the biopsy came back. In 5 days he called me to report that the tumor  was in fact cancerous and that I needed CT scans to stage the cancer. He referred me to a surgeon and an oncologist who would take it from there.After the CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis they determined that it was unlikely that the tumor had metastasized. However, a PET scan was performed to confirm and to locate the tumor more accurately so that the radiation treatments would pin point the tumor. On May 7th, I began chemo and radiation treatments. The purpose of these treatments is to shrink the tumor so that the surgery, if necessary, is minimally damaging to the rectum. I've learned so much about this specialized part of the colon. You see the rectum is located outside the peritoneum and has its own blood supply. This is why cancer in this region so often metastasizes to other parts of the body and why it is one of the deadliest forms of cancer. Shrinking the tumor is vital to saving an even more important part of the rectum, the sphincter. If the sphincter is damaged, I could be wearing a colostomy bag for the rest of my life....yuck. So to that end(the business end), I will receive 30 radiation treatments over 6 weeks. I also carry around a chemo pump 4 days a week with a continuous infusion of 5FU into a port in my chest which was surgically implanted prior to beginning the treatments.After the chemo and radiation treatments, there will be a 2 month recovery period during which time they will determine if a surgery is necessary. If it is, there will be an additional recovery period afterward and possible additional chemo treatments.Since beginning the treatments 2 weeks ago, I have been experiencing a variety of side effects of the treatment which have been impacting my ability to work. I have already reduced my work schedule in order to accommodate the treatments. I was informed that, the side effects will likely get worse and will continue for at least two weeks after the treatments stop. So as you can imagine, financially I am struggling already and I am concerned that my ability to work will be compromised further and for longer. My copays for the medical bills so far are into the thousands of dollars. So I am reaching out to my community for help. I have guestimated what my needs will be over the next 4-6 months of treatment. I will continue to work as much as I can and will only use what I need from whatever funds are gathered.Thanks you guys!",6854d16e1bf4964cdd437995f845767a,25,0.77675,240.0,0,1,general,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

Now, as Mahalia has numerous appointments every week and her reactions to the chemotherapy and other treatments are unpredictable, Erin can no longer work full-time as she needs to be available to support Mahalia and care for their children. Although Erin is continuing to work as much as possible, the stark reality is that their expenses have exponentially gone up while their household income has drastically gone down.Instead of building their lives in their new city, they are in a fight they never expected. Mahalia and Erin are both self-employed without the safety net of medical leave, and they have two small children to care for.Making a DifferenceMahalia needs ongoing help with:- childcare costs - living expenses - medications and supplies not covered by BC Health - complementary care - transportation to and from chemotherapy and other medical appointments As Mahalia is just at the beginning of this journey, there may be additional costs in the future that we cannot account for here. Below is what we anticipate is needed to get them through the first 12 months. ChildcareOne of the biggest expenses Mahalia is facing is for the care of baby Isaiah and little Ellemere. Mahalia is a wonderful mother and, right from the beginning, along with Erin, has been a dedicated, present and loving parent. Now with the side effects of chemotherapy, her ileostomy bag, and the permanent I.V. port in her chest, it is very difficult for her to do the physical tasks of parenting. Ellemere is in full-time daycare, which is needed now that Mahalia’s capacity for childcare is so greatly reduced. It is also a wonderful part of Ellemere’s day, where she has friends and fun distractions from the new reality at home. Part-time help at home is also desperately needed for things like taking Ellemere to daycare, picking her up, caring for Isaiah, preparing meals and feeding the kids, taking them out to play, and all the many things of parenting that are now much harder or impossible for Mahalia to do. While Erin is a fully involved and loving parent, she is trying to keep her work afloat and is challenged now to balance home and work so both can be sustainable. Your donation will go a long way toward supporting them with childcare.Living ExpensesYour loving contributions will help them cover their regular and monthly expenses. These things include rent, utilities and household bills, groceries, diapers and other items for the children. Medications and Medical SuppliesMahalia and Erin now have a budget category they never wanted. It is adding up quickly and your donations will help them with Mahalia’s ongoing medical expenses that are not covered by BC Health, including expensive ileostomy supplies and anti-nausea medications. Transportation Erin and Mahalia are experiencing increased costs in transportation as Mahalia has an average of 5-6 appointments a week. As they have always been committed to using public transportation, they will continue to bus to and from appointments whenever possible. However, side effects of chemotherapy can cause Mahalia to be extremely ill, and taxis and car share vehicles will be necessary at these times.Complimentary CareMahalia and Erin are doing everything in their power for Mahalia to get through this and watch their kids grow up together. Mahalia is determined to become a textbook medical miracle. For this reason, in collaboration with her oncology team, she is seeking complementary naturopathic care alongside her chemotherapy treatment - all of which is to be paid for out of pocket.





It Takes a VillageMahalia and Erin must shift their focus entirely towards Mahalia's journey through aggressive cancer treatment back to health - back to a life and future they fiercely want to share together with their children.Mahalia is determined to fight this, but it will take all of her and Erin’s strength.It is hard to ask for help but, at times, this is the only way forward.  Any level of contribution will be an enormous support to prop them up through a very challenging time.We need all your love, all your support, and all your visions of health for Mahalia. Thank you for holding Mahalia and her family up through this.With love and gratitude,Carla (cousin) and Emily, Kimberley, and Erin (friends)*Other ways you can help: Help us spread Mahalia's story!

Since that day, we’ve been overwhelmed by the constant support, outreach, and overall kind words provided by our friends, family, and loved ones. For those of you that may not know the full story, Daniel went into the ER on October 15th with symptoms of extreme fatigue, barely being able to walk, and severe headaches. Within 24 hours of his admission, our family heard the spectrum of diagnoses that transpired from just “extreme anemia” to the final words that changed our lives forever, “leukemia”. Immediately, we were filled with shock, despair, and an overall sense of confusion. “How could our Daniel at just 28 years old, be diagnosed with cancer?” crossed several of our minds.   Fast forward to present day, and all we can say is we are blessed. ALL is not the hardest cancer to beat but it is not the easiest.  Treatment is an intense 6 months with 8 rounds of chemo every 21 days requiring hospital stays each round for at least a week. These past 2 months could easily be compared to a roller coaster. There were constant battles of low hemoglobin, white cell, and platelet levels. These caused fatigue, low oxygen, an extremely weakened immune system, and a risk of bleeding.  Each treatment affects these levels differently and it’s been a constant battle to bring up these levels. If you are a blood donor, bless you!  Daniel has already received 26 blood transfusions and numerous IV bags of platelets. Though the treatment is hard, we thank God that Daniel’s cancer was caught and diagnosed in time! We were recently told by the doctors that for patients at the same state he was in, there is a 100% mortality rate within 4-5 weeks without treatment.Daniel, his wife Rebecca, and our families are truly humbled by all the love, prayers and support from family, friends, our church families, and the wonderful oncology staff at Mercy Hospital. Daniel and Rebecca are fighting as hard as they can and need as much help as they can get.  They have had to spend 40 out of the last 66 days in the hospital.  Due to the nature of his treatment and amount of time in the hospital, Daniel requires constant care, which means both Daniel and Rebecca have had to put their jobs on hold. We are grateful for any help with the financial burden of mounting medical bills and expenses, so they can focus on their fight.   Any amount of support would be a tremendous blessing to help get them through.",464621c0b47af878c59e2e45447ef13a,22,0.1704,390.0,1,1,leukemia,0,3,0,3,0,0.006711409395973154,0.0,0.3593502377179081,4.139423983050845,0.0,gofundme

And that is AFTER he had a significant brain bleed!  What a fighter.  Timothy makes grumbly sounds when he’s annoyed and clarion cries when he needs a diaper change.  He smiles at our voices and loves when we carry him, sing, and dance.In babies, neuroblastoma is usually relatively easy to defeat, requiring only 2 rounds of chemotherapy.  But after his first round of chemotherapy, DNA from a biopsy of a skin tumors showed that his cancer was not the standard form, but a high risk form of neuroblastoma.  There are two ways to treat high risk neuroblastoma.  This cancer has a 40%- 50% long term survival rate regardless of which treatment plan we choose.   Both methods involve 5 initial rounds of strong chemotherapy, followed by surgery to remove whatever masses of tumor are remaining, radiation of the tumor sites, and one more round of chemo, followed by immunotherapy.  However, the protocol followed in hospitals in the DC area requires that we harvest from Timothy stem cells from and administer 2 additional, extremely severe rounds of chemo.   Because the chemotherapy is so strong,  many patients cannot regenerate their own blood cells without transplanting the harvested stem cells, and even then, sometimes the transplant doesn't work.  Stem cell harvesting has only been performed on a baby Timothy's size once or twice in the US.  Of course, the harshness of this last chemotherapy, the lack of experience in harvesting stem cells from small babies, the likelihood of infection, and the possibility that the harsh chemo's side effects may kill Timothy give us serious reservations in selecting this approach.The second method requires us to travel with Timothy periodically in New York over 18 months to receive treatment that uses a different form of immunotherapy and 7 doses of vaccine to help the body develop the ability to attack the tumor cells.  This specialized treatment is only available at Sloan-Kettering in Manhattan. We have decided to  take the him to Sloan-Kettering after his fifth round of chemotherapy, as it will be gentler on Timothy and its success rate is comparable to the prevailing method in DC.Doctors also recommended genetic testing of the cancer cells to see if there were some sort of non-toxic, targeted collateral attack we might use against the cancer.  While insurance has helped with covering some of the costs of fighting this awful disease, it is not covering as much as we'd like.  Further, insurance will not cover genetic testing that could target Timothy’s chemo and speed recovery.  And while some Sloan-Kettering costs will be covered, much of the treatment and the costs of living with Timothy in New York for 3 months out of 18 will not.Since the day Timmy was born, we have lived from minute to minute, waiting and watching, making decisions about his care, and praying that he will live.  And we've thought more broadly about our other three children, working to give them consistent focus and love to help them as they suffer through this as well.  Foremost, we ask for your prayers for Timmy and us.  We accept God's plan for us all through this and are grateful for the focus on faith and love this trial brings.  Our church community, family, and other friends have been extremely supportive.  In fact, it is only through the suggestion and encouragement of our friends that we make this plea.  We estimate that we will incur out-of-pocket expenses of at least $65,000 over the next 12 months as we fight for Timothy’s life.  We hate asking anyone to help us with this, but do so in hope we can stay afloat for Timothy and the other children as well.  Should we have donations exceeding expenses, we will contribute the remainder to cancer charities.We thank you so much for considering supporting Timothy and his family, and wish you God's blessings.-Patrick and Mary Anne**As federal employees, we have consulted with our ethics advisors at Navy and DOC.  We ask that, if you are considering supporting Timmy financially,  no corporate donations, but rather only personal donations, are provided to ensure we keep within federal ethics guidelines.  Thank you for considering!",6251974f7cd02ee50195ba1554db6767,38,0.36215384615384616,90.0,4,1,neuroblastoma,0,3,0,3,0,0.003232758620689655,0.0,0.27637249391043656,8.138728017422387,0.0,gofundme

After seeing several doctors from the Henry Ford Health System, he was left with no diagnosis except possible GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease). October 2017, he was taking the stairs up to his office and he suddenly had a sharp pain in his lung. He contacted his new Doctor at the University of Michigan and they wanted him to be seen immediately. He then was diagnosed with a blood clot, which is very unusual for a young, healthy and active man. At this time his doctor decided to biopsy the lymph nodes taken. November 2017, he was heartbreakingly diagnosed with stage IV Esophageal Cancer. December 2017, Uncle Mike began chemotherapy with the high hopes of prolonging his life and to help slow the spreading of his cancer. This treatment regimen was successful for about 8 months. August 2018, he was put through more rigorous testing. The tests indicated that his cancer was spreading and he was then given 6-12 months to live if he continued treatment. He then flew to Houston, Texas to be seen by one of the best Cancer Centers in the world for a second opinion. Here, the doctors agreed with the prognosis and estimated approximately 12 months left to live. They recommended that he continue IV chemotherapy treatment while also adding Keytruda. October 2018, Uncle Mike had been feeling sick for about 3 weeks. He decided he needed to be seen and went to the doctor. All of his lab tests were negative, indicating that his sickness is strictly from cancer. The doctors felt that continuing chemotherapy would no longer be effective for prolonging his life. Hospice is now being recommended. ************My Uncle Mike is an incredible man and has such a big heart for everyone. Not only is he my Uncle, he is also my Godfather. He is the man who married my now Husband and I. He put his heart and soul into my beautiful ceremony all while starting his first round of chemotherapy. He is a fighter and although they feel treatment will no longer benefit him, he is not excepting that answer. He is loved by so many and as a family, we are all pulling together to help in any way that we can.Uncle Mike recently had no other choice then to leave his job. He wants to spend his time with his family, focus on himself and his health. He's trying new treatment regimens with the hope of some positive outcome. His new treatments are very costly and will be an out of pocket expense. Combining expenses from past treatments, future costs and now no longer being well enough to work, we need everyone to rally together and help him fight the fight. Help us spread the love for Mike Chisholm and donate to him in his time of need. He needs to rest and allow his body to heal without the stressors of current costs and in the near future expenses.  February 2019, Uncle Mike will be welcoming his first grandbaby to the family. I can't bear the thought of him not being present for the arrival of Baby Boy Chisholm. That is NOT an option. I truly feel that with the support of each of you, we can help him.

Seizure medication would not help and after almost a year of seeing a neurologist who refused to help me or refer me; I decided to find a brain surgeon on my own to see if I could get the tumor removed. All I wanted was my life back. When I met my surgeon, he looked at me and said “You are 22 years old, you do not deserve to live your life like this. Let’s get this thing out of your head.” So after a few weeks of staying in the hospital and undergoing numerous tests, my surgery was finally scheduled. I underwent a craniotomy on November 15, 2017 and had my right temporal lobe, hippocampus, amygdala, and half of the tumor removed. On November 28, 2017 I had to have my stitches removed and that is when my doctor told me that my “benign brain tumor” was in fact cancer. I was diagnosed with an astrocytoma- one of the most deadly and rarest kinds of tumors. The rest of the tumor lies in a place that if it were removed it would probably paralyze me. Because of the kind of tumor I have, I will never be cured and there is 0% chance of me ever being cancer free. So now I have to be closely monitored with MRIs, tests, and doctor visits every month for the rest of my life. My doctors informed me that the reason I have such a rare cancer at such a young age is because I grew up in the same city where the largest nuclear meltdown in U.S. history took place. The meltdown took place in 1959 in the hills of Simi Valley and the site was NEVER cleaned up. The Santa Susana Field Lab is less than 10 miles from where I grew up. So my whole childhood I was constantly exposed to radiation and toxic chemicals without ever knowing.I am still in constant pain and I struggle everyday because I suffer from chronic migraines. I owe thousands of dollars in medical expenses and I am still waiting to be approved for federal disability. So I am asking for help from anyone who can! I have never been the kind of person to do this, but I feel like I have no other options at this point.

Belle, 4. Cinderella. She has watched just about every single Disney movie that is out there. (Athena got to meet Belle and Rapunzel at her treatment appointment. I know in the picture she doesn't look excited, but believe me she was ecstatic.)So, the reason I am starting this account to to try to help her and our family kick cancers ass. At the beginning of June 2018 Athena had an ear infection. Justin and Sara took her to the doctors where she was given some medication for the ear infection. Then about a week later Athena started to develop Bells Palsy (a temporarily facial paralysis). She started having a bunch of bruises all over her body. So they took Athena to the doctors again. After some blood work they found out that her platelet levels had dropped significantly. The doctors at Texas Children's Hospital told Justin and Sara that Athena would have to be moved to the Houston downtown hospital. After she got the the TCH Downtown and a couple days there, her vitals were getting worse so they admitted her to the Pediatric ICU. The doctors performed MRI, PET Scans, CAT Scans and Bone Scans to try to figure out what was going on with Athena. The had to give her platelets so that way her body would be strong enough to be able to perform a bone marrow aspiration. After all these test, we found out that Athena has a rare childhood cancer called Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma. She is already in Stage 4 and has spread throughout her entire body. The primary tumor started behind her ear, which was the cause of the ear infection symptoms.  This type of cancer a very aggressive cancer that attacks the soft tissue, connecting tissue and the bones. It metastasis (spreads) fast through the body, through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood. Athena has started her first rounds of treatment. The doctors are hoping that the chemo and the radiation will kill the cancer. Athena will have to go through chemotherapy for the next several weeks. Then she will have to go through several treatments of radiation everyday Monday-Friday for several weeks. The family and Athena have a long road ahead of them fighting this cancer. Athena is a very strong little girl, with alot of fight in her. Justin has taken off work since the first day (which wouldn't we all if it was our child). Him being out of work to be with Athena during this terrific time has put him in a financial bind, which is something that he shouldn't have to be worried about. If you make the decision to help them out, your monetary contribution will be going to help with:1. Household Bills (since Justin has taken some time off work)2. Medical Bills3. Gas going to and from the hospital for treatments4. Parking at the hospital (which is like any $10-$20 a day)5. Miscellaneous things that may come up.If, you are in a position to help out our family it is GREATLY appreciated. No matter if it is $5 or $100. Everything helps. If, you can't help out monetarily then if you would please share Athena's story with people that you know.I will try to give as much updates to Athena's condition as we learn. Thank you SO MUCH for taking the time to read my little princesses story.  #TEAMATHENA",aa170004ba055a9e9b7daf0e7e2beb0f,52,0.3782,180.0,2,1,general,0,2,0,2,0,0.00273224043715847,0.0,0.7349397590361446,2.41145531121352,0.0,gofundme

Unfortunately, she is younger than the recommended age for breast cancer screenings.  Sadly, she had noticed some breast changes a few months prior and mentioned it to the ER staff during a sick visit and at a thyroid appointment.  Her concerns were dismissed, and she was told caffeine could cause lumps in breast tissue.  By the time her concerns were taken seriously, it had advanced to stage 4 cancer that has spread to other organs and tissues.  Her treatment involves oral chemotherapy and hormone therapy at this time.  They have told her it is incurable, but they hope to manage it with this treatment regime and hope to shrink the tumor.  Christi has been married to Frankie for 20 years and is the proud mother of a 19 year old son named Gabriel.  Christi and her family live on a very fixed income and have found the added gas expenses, persrciption costs, eating out during hospital and doctor  visits for treatments and care, and other basic needs a real financial challenge.  I wanted to bless them by starting a GoFundMe page to ask most of all for your continued prayers for this family.  We believe in and serve a mighty God who has the power to heal and gives hope, peace, and strength in our times of need.  We know if is  God's will, he can heal her from this cancer and restore her.  She is in good spirits despite the side effects of chemotherapy and is fighting the good fight. If you feel led to assist them financially, donations of any amount would be a blessing to them.  I would love to see them have some extra money to enjoy doing more things together as a family like maybe taking a trip, making memories doing fun things they enjoy, and not worrying about where the the money for the next bill, medicine or need will come from.  If you are unable to give or prefer not to, we understand.  Prayers are the best line of defense when in battle.  We covet your prayers and know they do not fall on deaf ears.  Thank you for lifting up this family in prayer and assisting them in their time of greatest need.",8e14664d3c567334dd2b7470616b8445,20,0.55875,480.0,2,1,breast cancer,0,3,0,3,0,0.007556675062972292,0.0,0.6977594878829446,3.6340159769978557,0.0,gofundme

We found out because he went to the ER one night believing he was having a heart attack. They immediately started running tests. His heart was fine, but he was anemic. The doctors wanted to run tests to see where the blood was going. An endoscopy revealed the tumor. The medical staff quickly began the referral process. Soon, he met the team that would treat him. His treatment plan is chemo and radiation to shrink the tumor and then surgery to remove it. He has chemo every Friday and radiation therapy every day (Monday through Friday) for 6-8 weeks. Two weeks after he finishes up his chemo and radiation here in Paducah, we will go to Louisville for another endoscopy. Two weeks after that, he will have his surgery. His surgery is called an Ivor Lewis Esophagectomy. The surgeon will cut a portion of his esophagus out, pull his stomach up and reattach it to what is left of his esophagus. They will make two incisions- one on the side of his chest, and another at the bottom of his esophagus. His recovery will greatly depend upon whether they can do the surgery with the robot or if they have to open him up. The latter will greatly increase his recovery time. So, why do we need everyone’s help? When dad was diagnosed, his life quickly changed to start combatting his cancer. Appointments were quickly made, sometimes a few in one day. Either way, because he had to miss so much work, his job let him go. It seems heartless, I know, but as they said, they have a business to run. So, Dad applied for unemployment. He was initially approved based on the reasoning for his being let go. However, because he can not work full time, they disqualified him from receiving an unemployment check. Dad also applied for disability at the suggestion of his care team. Thankfully, he was approved. However, we found out that he will not get his first check for five months. Not only that, but he won’t receive back pay. In a a perfect world, we would all have savings accounts for this sort of thing, but as we know, this world is far from perfect. My mom recently became disabled and they are now living soley on her disability income. The truth of the matter is that without some sort of supplement, they can’t make ends meet. They need help with the following:-paying bills left after my mom’s check is gone-money for essentials like toiletries and household products-gas to and from radiation every day-travel expenses to Louisville for his appointments, consultations, and surgery-food and lodging for my mom while he is in ICU and food while he is recovering.-a new A/C unit as theirs just went out. Fortunately, they were given window units to get them through the summer, but will need a new unit for heat in the winter.-money to pay someone to mow their lawn as my dad is often too worn out to mow (or someone to mow it)Dad is determined to win his fight. As he told me, he wants to see his granddaughter, Magnolia, grow up. He is a fighter. After 18 years in the Army, it runs through his veins.  I want my parents to be able to focus on my dad getting better, not lacking enough to get by.  We know that God is good regardless of the valley we are going through!Anything will help, friends. If you have any questions, I would be glad to answer them. If you have any suggestions we are open to those as well. Please pray for our family. Much love,Jessica Gibson",1446d86137e676afa461ca8c7512ee2e,43,0.8433333333333334,180.0,1,1,esophageal cancer,0,2,0,2,0,0.003115264797507788,0.0,0.8483618440127573,3.6297147764596946,0.0,gofundme

After two rounds, the cancer was almost all gone. After four, it was almost all back.Not good.So, we moved on to Brentuximab.That's a less harsh, more targeted type of chemo. That stopped the disease from progressing, but it did not have the type of impact we'd hoped for.And, at that time, my local oncologist called me in to tell me ... that was it.After three different chemos and a month of radiation, they had nothing more here, in Harrisburg, PA, they could give me.Thankfully, however, Johns Hopkins - who was working with me to do my transplant - called.I'll never forget that first call.""Brian, we've been looking at your scans, and we'd like for you to come in and discuss your options.""OK.Scary stuff.And that conversation, initially, started off with things you don't like to hear.""In cases of Hodgkins like yours...."" What followed wasn't good.But, then we got, ""But there's some good news...""And, here is what that good news was —I was being considered for a clinical that Hopkins was running, and, if I was interested, I could likely get in.The science involved here is amazing.I'm getting Nivo, an immunotherapy, that is approved.The clinical drug is a Lag 3 inhibitor.Hodgkins' cells have a Lag 3 marker that make them invisible to your immune system.The Nivo turns on the immune system and super charges it.The Lag 3 inhibitor, in theory, goes to the cells with that marker and suppresses the Lag 3 part of them. It turns them on so the super-charged immune system can see them and chew them up.After 50 days, scans showed this amazing therapy IS WORKING for me. I'm feeling better each day, but this is all a build to get back to the bone marrow transplant.We have been able to raise a nice amount of money thanks to all of you, but we are making one final push, to try to make sure when I do go down for treatment all of our bases are covered. The current schedule, as long as this treatment continues to work, is for me to begin the transplant process Dec. 28.I'll do five days of chemo, one day of radiation, have a day off, then get the new stem cells. Then, I'll have to live in Baltimore, and go to Johns Hopkins, for at least 70 consecutive days.The costs are evident.I do not have long-term disability. So, after 26 weeks, I'll no longer receive pay. I'll get full pay for six weeks, and 60 percent for 20 weeks after. That, along with what we have already raised, and the bit more we hope to raise, will be counted on to keep the lights on here in Harrisburg, pay the bills and take care of me and my housing in Baltimore.Also, my mother will be stepping aside from her job as a waitress at Waffle House in South Carolina, to come here and be my caretaker while I go through all of this. So, there'll also be bills, etc., that are not yet evident. I've been humbled by this process, and the love shown, especially through this GoFundMe, has been amazing.If you can give anything, even a dollar, it's appreciated. And, if you can't, prayers, good vibes, whatever you do, are also accepted. Thanks and love you all,Brian",1b6e4e982d8765edb2a06f20780aed37,19,0.764,330.0,6,1,general,0,2,0,2,0,0.003048780487804878,0.0,0.014527127186480878,2.6340159769978557,0.0,gofundme

A big sister, Violinist and Ballet dancer. Our world came crashing down July 17th 2017 with her diagnosis of Medulloblastoma - a very agressive brain tumour. Her prognosis was supposed to be good with an 80% cure rate. Our world crashed again when she relapsed with metastasis and leptomeningeal spread during the end of radiation treatment last year. Prognosis now not so good. The doctors here at Sydney Children’s Randwick have never seen anything like it. After 3 rounds of intensive chemo, she now has widespread leptomeningeal disease. Unfortunately, there is no cure. Prognosis is even worse now.

Shortly after, we received the devastating diagnosis that she had an aggressive, late-stage brain tumor. Now, she is fighting for her life against stage IV brain cancer.


My Mom’s Story

For more than ten years, my mom worked as a restaurant waitress to single-handedly provide for our family of six. She regularly clocked over 100 hours a week and rarely took any time off in the decade that she spent waiting tables for thousands of customers. She taught herself the little English that she knows from memorizing menu items and took immense pride in being able to bring joy to people’s lives by serving them delicious food. For as long as I can remember, my mother’s always been a fighter. When my younger brother was diagnosed with a rare blood condition with no cure called hemophilia, she quickly learned from nurses how to inject medication to allow him to live a normal life. When my father was repeatedly incarcerated for domestic violence and drug addiction, she found ways to provide us safe, healthy, and nurturing environments to grow up in. My mother has survived homelessness and food insecurity, abuse and assault, and all while raising two kids and caring for her aging parents. Above all else, she’s modeled resilience, strength, and positivity in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Now, she’s facing what she considers to be just another hurdle to overcome: cancer. What HappenedMy family saved money for months to be able to afford to attend my graduation weekend at UCLA. My mom was especially excited — it was her first real vacation in years and it was also her first time visiting California. However, throughout their stay, she began to experience increasingly aggressive migraines that left her bedridden. For years, my mom has had regular headaches and bouts of forgetfulness, but we always thought that it was from her overworking herself at the restaurant.After she was sent to the ER, we learned that these weren’t normal signs of exhaustion; they were symptoms of an aggressive, late-stage brain tumor called glioblastoma, which has a five-year survival rate of just 5%.Once my mom was admitted to the hospital, doctors found that her tumor had grown so much that brain matter that should have been in the middle of her head had been pushed all the way to one side. Neurosurgeons had to place a shunt in her brain to relieve the pressure of the swollen mass. In the last month, her condition has quickly deteriorated; she’s been put on breathing tubes, her muscles have withered away, and she's been put on an intense regime of steroids, antibiotics, and other medication.The Road AheadMy mom has always been vigorously active, from working as a physical education teacher in China to dashing between tables as a waitress in Michigan. She’ll be transitioning from a fiercely independent lifestyle to one where she’ll need assistance with simple tasks like using the restroom and brushing her teeth. The initial bill that we received after only one week of hospitalization was almost $148,000. This amount has since tripled and is still growing. Because my mom is not a California resident, we’ve faced immense challenges with enrolling her for any form of emergency health insurance or financial support, even with the help of social workers and financial counselors.We’re extremely fortunate that she was able to undergo a partial tumor removal surgery at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. This intensive procedure removed a piece of the tumor that was the size of a hand. Now, she’ll need extensive physical and speech therapy, as well as months ahead of chemotherapy and radiation. If we’re lucky, she’ll be able to qualify for clinical trials. All of these amount to significant out-of-pocket costs. As the only immediate family member besides my sixteen-year-old brother who can speak fluent English and drive, I’ll be my mother’s primary caregiver in the months (and, hopefully, years) to come. I’ve decided to put my dream of attending law school on the backburner because our priority now is to give my mom the best life possible with the best treatment possible. It’s a daunting task, but one that I also consider an honor: to be able to take care of the person who has protected and nurtured us through some of life’s roughest storms. But to be honest, I can’t do this alone. In addition to overseeing my mom’s medical needs, I’ll also be caring for my elderly grandparents, raising my brother and helping him with applying to college in the fall, paying for our living expenses, finishing up classes for my degree, and completing a fellowship.Sometimes, it almost feels like too much. There’s nothing more terrifying than watching the person you love most slowly wither away before your eyes. This last month has been the most challenging time of my life and my biggest fear is that my mom won’t be able to get the care she needs because we can’t afford to foot the medical bill, or don’t have the money to get gas for the car. I’ve spent days writing and rewriting this plea for help. Any amount of support, whether it’s a single dollar or sharing this GoFundMe, would be immensely appreciated by my family.Thank you for helping me give my mom a fighting chance.",8d90026fc39380502ce438f1ffb3186e,35,0.62965,180.0,2,1,brain cancer,0,1,0,1,0,0.0010482180293501049,0.0,0.05196733481811433,1.4114553112135197,0.0,gofundme

All smiles and giggles at her Freshman orientation last week, you'd never know that she's fighting a life threatening illness!In early January 2015, Emma's family noticed a lump in her throat. After seeing her doctor and some tests and a biopsy, she was diagnosed two weeks later with thyroid cancer. Emma was referred to Phoenix Children’s Hospital where she was treated with surgery to remove her entire thyroid, as well as numerous lymph nodes that were also positive for cancer. In March 2015, Emma was back at Phoenix Children’s Hospital to begin her radioactive iodine treatment, which requires her to be isolated for 7 days, which we hoped would wipe out the remaining cancer We had hoped she was out of the woods, however in August 2015, Emma had additional testing and it was evident that there was more cancer in her neck tissue and lymph nodes and surgery was required again. On September 9, 2015, Emma was back in surgery for the second time to remove the cancer. In November 2015, she was once again preparing to undergo the radioactive iodine therapy and another round of isolation. We were hoping and praying it would finally be wiped out. In late January 2016, Robin, Emma’s mom, noticed what appeared to be swollen lymph nodes in Emma’s neck. Fortunately, she was already set up for a 3 month check since her last treatment. While the doctors were hopeful it was due to a recent cold, a course of antibiotics did not work and they proceed with an ultrasound followed by an MRI and CT scan. The results are showing more cancer and the doctors at Phoenix Children’s has reached out to a cancer specialist in Houston, Texas for further treatment. At each point we have all been praying that the cancer would be gone and Emma would be able to resume being a 13 year old without these heavy burdens. Moving treatment to Texas, while wonderful to have additional specialists caring for Emma’s condition, is taxing on the family emotionally and financially. Emma's parents, Steve and Robin Warner have exhausted their savings over this past year, paying medical expenses as well as due to loss of income while Steve, the family provider, takes the needed time away from his work to support his family. Since it is now a new year, that means starting over with their high deductibles and out of pocket insurance costs as well as added expenses of traveling to Houston for specialized treatment. They are expecting Emma will need a third surgery and likely other treatments – the future is unclear at this point. The burden they carry for their precious daughter is more than most can bear. This is a time for the community to rally together in love, prayer and financial support to lift this family up and help carry them through the more trying times that are coming for their child. Together we can make a difference – even small donations can be a huge impact.Please join us in praying for healing and for strength to endure this situation and to find the blessings that it contains and the endurance to continue ahead.

He just recently began Immunotherapy and we are very hopeful it will work. The tumor is in his chest wall and growing. William was recently hospitalized for severe back pain.

She was diagnosed January 2012 .This little girl has been through so much in her short life. Countless rounds of chemotherapy and even radiation. Trinity has had many ups and down through out her journey but she continue to fight with a smile on her face. Trinity had reached her limit on chemotherapy and has been off chemotherapy since the end of summer 2014. Her tumor had been stable since and seem to show improvement. Since then we have been dealing with side effects from treatment and tumor but recently our world had change very drastically. Trinity had been experiencing headaches and neck pain. She was showing signs of tightness on her left side and had a droopy lip on the left side. We took her to our local emergency room were they consulted with u of m. U of M had moved her Mri up sooner then the beginning of November. They sent her home with a different pain medication which was helping but then that stop working as well. We were extremely worried. Trinity had a eye appointment with her eye doctor and everything was going good but at the end the doctor notice edema in the back of her eyes and wanted her MRI moved up asap. On October 6th 2017 was her MRI day and that is the day that our life had change drastically. We found out that trinity had a second tumor in a different location that had grown drastically. It was not even on the MRI in May 2017 but had grown drastically since then. Her first tumor was still stable and actually looked better then her May MRI this was so hard to take in. She was admitted that evening and put on steroids instantly which helped with the swelling and pain. On October 7th she had a biopsy to take a sample of the tumor and we were later released a week later. We went back for the result on October 16 and found out that the new tumor is a grade 4 Glioblastoma. It is consider inoperable because of the location it is at. It is possible that if removed she could lose motor functions. We are so scared for her and trying to be as strong as we possibly can for her, but we know how aggressive this tumor can be. We discuss her options with her onconologist and she felt her best options at this point is to start radiation therapy which will be a 6 week treatment in Ann Arbor. This was a complicated decision to make because we were informed when we met with the radiation doctor that on the initial MRI the tumor area that would have to be attacked looked like it was pushing on the brain stem or was moving into the brain stem. She said that she would have to target that area as well which trinity could have some weakness & numbness on the left side. We live almost 2 hours away so there be a lot of traveling back and forth.

She's my ""person""--the one who's always in my corner and the one who can tell me when I'm being a jerk.  That friend who celebrates my highs and crawls in the hole with me for my lows. ￼She's 39 years old and a mother to Shyla, the most amazing 5 year old I have ever met.￼A week ago, we were talking about light fixtures and furniture for the fixer-upper home she just bought in September with the love of her life, Dustin, and laughing about how living without a kitchen wasn't really affecting her since she doesn't like to cook.Two days later, we were talking about cancer. Her cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer--which I would later learn is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer that isn't even discovered until you're already in stage 3 or 4. The news brought me to my knees. Immediately, I thought of my ""niece"" and the possibility that she could live a life without my friend as her mother. The air left my lungs. Google offered no solace--this cancer is a relentless bitch.The days since have been a whirlwind--a biopsy confirmed she has a malignant tumor in her breast and an ultrasound revealed the cancer has spread to her lymph nodes. We held our breath for the next few days while we waited for the results of an MRI of her brain, a bone scan and a CAT scan--all done to determine if this rapidly advancing cancer has spread to any of her other organs.Miraculously, the other tests have given us good news. It appears that the cancer is centralized to her breast and lymph nodes, which gives us a glimmer of hope in a somewhat grim diagnosis. Yesterday, the chemo port was implanted in her chest, and it all became real. This fight is going to take everything she has, and it won't be easy--4 months of chemo, followed by a mastectomy, and then months of radiation.Two nights ago, she had to share the news with her 5 year old daughter. Shyla has an ACTIVE imagination (you should hear this kid tell a story), so Tracy thought it was best to be honest with her. She told her about mommy's cancer and that she would be getting medicine that would make her lose her hair. ""The talk"" went well, and shortly after Shyla appeared with this picture she drew for her mom:￼￼As Shyla explained, this is a checklist. The top picture shows Tracy now, then a bald Tracy when her hair falls out. The third picture is the medicine, then a picture of Tracy with her hair growing back. And the last picture is Tracy ""when Mommy can do anything."" The boxes will be checked off as Tracy goes through each stage.I told you...the kid's brain is unbelievable.Tracy has an incredible support system--her fiance, Dustin, her parents, siblings and extended family, and a huge network of friends. What she doesn't have is the means to cover all her medical bills.  She is a straight commission salesperson, so if she's not working, she's not making money, and she will not be able to do her job while she battles this. So, her income will stop effective immediately. Dustin will also lose income as he makes sacrifices to care for Tracy and their daughter.As we spent an entire day at the cancer center on her 10 year anniversary with Dustin and the day of Shyla's first Christmas Concert, we talked about her fears --how her treatment would impact her family, how many more things in her life she would have to miss out on, her concern that they would have to sell the house they just purchased and have spent months fixing up. Here's the thing: my friend is a very proud person--she would be the first person to give you the shirt off her back, but struggles with asking for help. At that moment, the ""best friend tough love"" kicked in and I turned to her and said that she would get through this, but would ""have to suck up her pride and accept some help"" (with some curse words added in for effect). This is where you come in. You may know Tracy. Or she may be a complete stranger. But please know that whatever you choose to invest in her--her life, her family, her home and the future of that little girl with the HUGE imagination--it's going to an incredible human being and partner, a loving mother, a dedicated sister and daughter, and the best friend anyone could ask for. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you in advance for finding room in your heart to help this family.￼",b34d9c404316af70688d726438848fe9,32,0.77346,30.0,3,1,breast cancer,0,2,0,2,0,0.0024154589371980675,0.0,0.3945375258205187,4.775972252924268,0.0,gofundme

Although her cancer was aggressive and being fed by a specific protein in her bloodstream, her prognosis was a 95% chance of survival. She underwent 5 surgeries, 6 rounds of chemo, and 28 rounds of radiation. After nearly a year of being ""cancer-free"", she began having severe back pain along with other concerning symptoms. Initial scans have revealed that the cancer has probably never left, and has since invaded her bones, from her ribs to her spine and all the way down to her knees. The prognosis is not good, and she has been told she only has 2-5 more years to spend with her family. She is currently in the process of getting a second opinion from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, where she will be evaluated for possible clinical trials and any other life-prolonging measures they can make. Her first appointment is set in the middle of October, and we hope to have better news at that time. Heather, a wife and mother of 3, is only 35 years old. She works at a bank in Waynesboro, GA, and has many friends and loved ones. She is quick to help anyone in need, and she is a wonderful and loving mother to her daughter(16) and two boys (5 and 3). She is still working, but the expenses are going to add up quickly, and the family needs help to finance the trips back and forth to Texas, the cancer treatments, and to supplement income for any time she and her husband, Toby, need off from work. We ask for thoughts and prayers, and any monetary donation you can spare to help them through this difficult time. If you cannot make a donation, please share her story with friends in the hopes that more prayers and donations can be made. We also ask that comments about her condition not be made in front of her youngest boys, as they will not be told of their mom's cancer returning until after she shows the effects of any cancer treatments.

Less than a month ago, we could not pronounce “Embryonal Parameningeal Rhabd omyosarcoma “and now it is a frequent term in our vocabulary. And if that weren’t hard enough, “Grp4” and “stage 4” are attached to the label. And “right sphenoid sinus and carotid artery”. And “inoperable” and “life threatening”. Our lives have been irreversibly altered. Our daughter has cancer. Our beautiful and innocent 11-year old now says, ""The whole side of my face is numb."" Hannah had complained of headaches. We thought it was a sinus infection. We have learned that a soft deadly mass, more than an inch wide had been silently growing inside her, next to her brain, without symptom or warning.  Does inoperable mean incurable? Medical science has made great progress and Hannah can benefit from these advances. The doctors tell us that there IS treatment. Chemotherapy CAN be successful, along with radiation. We raise our hopes. We are in the biggest battle of our lives.We have started aggressive chemotherapy. But Hannah needs an even more innovative approach that is not available in South Africa where we live. A new radiation therapy called Pencil Beam Proton Beam Therapy, that allows precise amounts of targeted radiation and does not damage surrounding tissue, is Hannah’s only option. The problem: Proton Beam Therapy is extremely (repeat, extremely) expensive. The solution: A long journey to a cutting-edge pediatric cancer facility. And $500,000.Five hundred thousand dollars to get the Proton Beam Radiation treatment and Chemotherapy to kill the cancer and save our daughter’s mental capacities so she can grow up and look forward to a normal life.  Like you, we’ve worked hard, been responsible, planned ahead, saved, but not enough to get the only therapy that has any chance of killing the cancer inside her without killing the brain that makes her who she is.  In the last few weeks, we have learned more about cancer treatment than we ever wanted to know. Hannah’s hair has fallen out, and she has shown strength none of us knew she had. We have gathered family and friends around us, in a cry for help that has reached people ten thousand miles away and we are urgently building a life-saving network for Hannah.Hannah never expected to need this kind of help, but now it is crucial for her to be saved. We thought we had planned for the future. But plans can be shattered in an instant.

I am married to my high school sweetheart, Caroline, of 20 years & we have 3 beautiful children: our son Addison (9), daughter Atlanta (5) & youngest son Arthur (3). I am 35 years old. My family has been hit with CANCER for the 2nd time in less than 6 months. First, my father is diagnosed in May of this year with terminal brain cancer, praise God he is alive & doing well. Now ME! This past spring I first noticed two lumps  on the right side of my neck. After doing a bit of research I simply thought nothing of them as I had no other symptoms. In August, two more lumps showed up, one under my chin & the other on my left clavical. I decided to see my PCP just to be safe. After an ultrasound & blood work I pretty much was no longer concerned because blood work was great & all my doctor said was I had swollen lymph nodes. He did suggest I see an ENT specialist to just confirm that, so I scheduled an appointment for early September. On Labor Day, Monday evening 9/7 I headed to OKC from Tulsa to begin 2 weeks of training for my new job as a loan officer with Cornerstone Home Lending. On Wednesday, just two days after I arrived, I was awakend at 5:00am to the worst headache I had ever experienced in my life & I don't ever get headaches. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the highest this was a 12. Those persisted every day & mainly at night for the next 8 days. In fact some nights I couldn't sleep at all & was up all night before needing to go to the CHL office for 8 hours of training. In the middle of this I was having soaking wet night sweats, which now I realize had been happening for 2 months even at home (not soaking wet one's, but still night sweats). I played in a tennis tournament that weekend & actually won it & even passed my Oklahoma state mortgage exam, all by the grace of God. I bought reading glasses thinking that might help my headaches, I went to a chiropractor 3 days in a row, but nothing would releave them. Wednesday evening, September 16th I again spoke with my MD friend in OKC & told him about these swollen lymph nodes. He said to visit his clinic in the morning so he could take a look at the lymph nodes and perform an eye exam. Once he saw my lymph nodes he immediately said that my left clavical was a Virchow's Node & that was a sign of Cancer. I headed home 2 days early from OKC to get MRI's done asap. On Friday night the 18th of September, I had 3 MRI's: brain, neck and abdomen. My doctor called me the next day to inform me that the neck & stomach were of concern as lymph nodes were ""lighting up all over the place"" & he was concerned it was lymphoma cancer. Next step was a biopsy of a node to confirm that fear. The following Tuesday I had a consultation with a surgeon. He said he was 99.9% sure I had lymphoma as you could feel the nodes from my groin area to my neck & everywhere in between including my arm pits. The biopsy surgery was performed on Thursday, September 24th, 2015.On Tuesday, September 29th,  we met with the surgeon to go over the results of the biopsy & sure enough it was B-cell Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma Cancer and they believe is a minimum of stage 3 & possibly stage 4. It appears to be fast growing & aggressive & progressing quickly. Of course that is not an easy report to hear no matter who you are & what you believe. At this point we have already encurred a tremendous amount of expenses as our fight to beat cancer begins. It's as if an entirely 2nd life is added on to what you already live in your normal life which doesn't slow down or stop for anything, including cancer. In order to attack this with nutrition, natural therapies & much more it will be extremely expensive over the next 6 to 12 months, perhaps as much as $50,000 or more on top of all our normal expenses. With both my wife Caroline & I being on 100% commission & me just starting a new job, it's not the most ideal time for us financially to be facing this challenge. There is no way realistically that her nor I can work during this time at the same capacity we would normally be able to. We are both still working & will continue to as much as humanly possible. It's going to take little to no stress, lots of time & a huge amount of financial resources to beat cancer in the most effective way possible. I have literally seen my life flash before my eyes in the past 10 days. I can't imagine not living as I LOVE my life & my family. We will be happy to detail out our specifics needs for anyone who wants to help us financially or feels led to support. These expenses include, but are not limited to   health & nutrition changes regarding food, supplements, herbs, certain machines, specific lymphatic system therapies, medical consultations and treatments. We have already begun the road back to health and believe combining all of these treatments is what is necessary to have the best chance of me WINNING. In addition, we will also have much of our normal work time eaten up with the time it takes to beat cancer & that cost us lots of money. Please feel free to email us at the email provided if you would like to know more specifics on what your hard earned money will go towards.


I will tell you this. It's going to a family who wants their husband, daddy, brother & son to live a long life & is going to do everything humanly possible to not only beat cancer but live cancer free for the rest of my days. It will go to give us the resources to make decisions that increase my odds dramatically that we just can't make without this financial support. You are literally investing in my life to save my life & a THANK YOU is honestly not even enough.

She has suffered through long chemo sessions, hair loss, a bone marrow transplant, Graft vs. Host Disease complications, T Cell therapy, arthritis in her legs and uveitis in her eye, as well as the little every day hardships like spending what should be carefree childhood days in a hospital bed. She has spent too much of her young life carrying this terrible burden. But she is not giving up her fight against cancer. And neither are we. Her mom and dad are both teachers who have been doing the best they can.

Your support will go towards medical bills, mortgage payments, utilities, and treatments needed to help us get through this difficult holiday season. We have created an account tied to GoFundMe for my father specifically for this cause.ABOUT NICK:To many, our Dad is known as charismatic, outgoing, and a spunky guy who will give you his shirt off his back even if he has nothing of his own to replace it. A man that came to this country with nothing, and started his own business to support his family. A man who has spent almost 40 years of his life working every day and night landscaping yards all around the east bay and making friends a long the way. One of those guys who when his name mentioned, you always hear; “Oh you know Nick?! What a wonderful character! He helped us with….”. A man that is known in the Greek Community as “The Cretan” because of his big moustache and even bigger personality. To us, his 3 daughters, he is our amazing Dad or “Baba”. He has taught us about hard work and determination, and he always went the extra mile to make sure we had what we needed throughout our childhood. Unfortunately, Cancer chose him earlier this year. Being self-employed and now unable to work, he is now in a position where medical costs, mortgage payments, and bills are piling up and adding additional stress on his health. Uncertainty weighs heavy on him and his entire family as we all struggle to get through each day, week, and month. With that being said, with humility and grace, we ask who my father has helped, inspired, delighted, or made smile to help our family financially in this difficult time.BACKGROUND:Our Dad was diagnosed with Stage 4 Renal Cell Carcinoma (aka Kidney Cancer) in March 2017. It took an exhausting and scary few months to determine what was causing all the debilitating symptoms (weakness, uncontrollable cough, stomach pain, etc… ). The ultimate diagnosis was that he had an enormous mass (12 cm x 8 cm) engulfing his left kidney and attaching to his intestinal wall. This past Summer he underwent a successful Radical Nephrectomy (removal) of his left kidney and subsequent removal of 6 inches of his bowels. Nick recovered from the surgery and was able to walk his daughter Dena down the aisle on her wedding day on June 10th. What an emotional moment for us all! Unfortunately, in additional scans the following week, we found out the cancer had metastasized and has spread beyond his kidney and into his left lung. It was devastating news. Of course, our thought was to have another surgery again to remove the new lung tumor. It was growing rapidly and we were concerned that it would spread into his bones and other organs. As we prepared for another surgery, we received more bad news. The week before the scheduled surgery, our Nick began to throw up blood and was rushed to the ER. Through CT scans, we found a large blood clot and tumor embolism in his right lung. Due to the blood clot and tumor embolism in his right lung, it would be fatal to now attempt a surgery as both lungs are at risk. The tumor in his lung has now grown, as well as the blood clot and tumor emboli. We have now reached the point of immunotherapy (Systemic IV Treatment; similar to chemo), which my father has been undergoing now for a few months with no improvements. Through all these hurdles my father's spirit has remained strong, but his energy and physical strength are in a downward spiral. His deteriorating health and energy levels make working difficult on most days and impossible on others. With very little income and a monthly mortgage payment and medical bills, we must make some difficult decisions. Nick must sell the business he built over 40 years, as well as the home in which he raised three beautiful daughters. With Winter in front of us, no offers on the business and home, and our father no longer able to work, financial support is needed to get our mother and father through this difficult time. It breaks our heart to see our father deteriorate as he is someone who has given money, fed, and provided those in need with shelter, safety, and comfort over these years. The financial struggles currently and continue to come are real for our family now, with his treatments in process, and as much pride that our family holds, we cannot do this alone.OUR ASK:We now ask for help during this holiday season to help with the overwhelming financial burdens as he can no longer work. The money donated will go to his medical bills, mortgage payments, utilities, food, and treatments needed to help him fight his stage 4 cancer! If your own personal situation would make it difficult to donate funds, we ask for your prayer that God will continue to provide and that you help us spread this donation message on your social feed to drive awareness. If your own financial security allows you to help, we ask that you donate what you can to help Nick and his family through this difficult time.

They were located in the left frontal lobe and had to be removed.  Surgeons had informed us that 2 would not be able to be removed because they were too deep and close to critical parts. So critical that if attempted to remove, could more than likely paralyze her. The mass itself was the size of an average egg, but the swelling in her brain was double that size.  On May 10, 2018 open brain surgery was preformed to remove the mass/tumor having left two behind. The mass was successfully removed as planned. ￼  The results of a malignant brain tumor had set her on this long course of radiation and chemotherapy treatment.  We will be starting friendships with doctors at Duke Hospital and Novant health who are tumor specialist with this kind of brain cancer. I'm sure there will be several more medical staff in and out too.  Although all of this seems to be overwhelming I find that God grabs a hold of us and shakes our sufferings up a bit to remind us his hand is on us. ￼  This is a stubborn, fast growing, aggressive cancer that will need to be treated aggressively and concurrently.  To stir the pot, she had started a new career and is set on the standard probationary period waiting on insurance. She is currently uninsured and her employment is on hold as well as her probationary period. Since this incident, her company has put her on a leave of absense; She cannot work and her life has dramatically changed in ways she could never have imagined.  This is the most challenging thing my mother has ever had to go through. We are asking for your help with this and promise that if there are any funds left we will pay them forward to someone else facing this tough fight.￼  My mother Tonya, is the most incredible woman I have ever met. A little bias you say? Of course but ask everyone else in line that agrees. She has so much love for her family, friends and grand babies. She has endlessly given to others just to brighten anyone’s day. So much of her goes into everything she does for others whether it’s by money, time, gifts, positivity etc. She always makes sure EVERYONE she knows is taken care of and always putting herself last. Let’s come together and show how much we love her and want to help her RID this!! Any and everything counts! This would be one big step forward to a stress free treatment process. ￼  Funds would go toward the fight, treatment and expenses toward facilitating her treatments. Food, lodging, gas and any other included to medical. Not only towards treatment, but towards her every day bills as well. Money is the very last thing I want her having to worry about at this point.

In other words, the radiation I received 25 years ago to treat my lymphoma is the underlying cause of this breast cancer. I will fight and beat this cancer just as I did the other! I know from experience that it is the power of prayer, positive thinking, and being surrounded by so much love that I will allow me to persevere and help my body find its way to good health once again.” - Gina GuthrieMy name is Alicia Carlin and I am a sister of Theta Phi Alpha Fraternity’s Beta Upsilon chapter at Saint Leo University. This year, for Theta Phi’s annual Rock Against Cancer event, we are honoring Gina Guthrie (or Aunt Gina as I call her)! Gina and my Mom met at the University of Florida during their undergraduate career and have been friends ever since. Fun fact: Gina found her Greek home at the University of Florida as a Kappa Delta. At 22 years old, upon graduation, Gina was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. As a result she received 12 rounds of chemotherapy followed by seven weeks of radiation. After extensive treatment and by the grace of God, Gina was cured of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. She continued with life, married her husband Mike, and together they had two children – Mia and Mike Jr. Mike and Gina’s children are such a God-given blessing because after her first round with cancer Gina was told there was only a 30% chance of having children. Gina currently owns and operates her own out-of-home business called Bocca Felice (“happy mouth” in Italian) which combines her passions of healthy eating, cooking, and serving others. She caters events such as banquets and weddings and uses all locally-grown, farm fresh ingredients. Gina was cancer free for 25 years, until the summer of 2017 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. However, it was concluded that the development of breast cancer was directly linked to the radiation treatment from Hodgkin’s lymphoma. On September 5, 2017 she underwent a bilateral mastectomy. The bilateral mastectomy was a success in that it not only removed the residual margin of the original 2.5cm tumor that we knew existed and had removed via lumpectomy on 5/25, but it also discovered an additional undetected 5.5cm tumor that had been hiding from mammography, along with 10/11 lymph nodes that contained disease. She recovered from surgery well but had to start back up on chemotherapy and radiation within a few weeks. From October 2017 to January 2018 she received six treatments of chemotherapy. Radiation treatments are up next, but she recently finished a visit from MD Anderson in Houston, Texas to possibly be a part of a radiation trial. Despite the devastating reality of cancer that Gina has lived and is currently living, she remains prayerful and radiates joy. She is truly a warrior, a powerful woman of God, and someone I look up to!",723122931db2e052b29ee61075e9b93f,22,0.6944,300.0,0,1,mixed,0,2,0,2,0,0.0038022813688212928,0.0,0.10318257956448912,2.727968671837326,0.0,gofundme

It was utter devastation when this formidable disease took him just weeks later on Friday, August 17, 2018.At just 45 years old and in otherwise good health, Ed's unexpected diagnosis, rapid deterioration, and sudden death have been harrowing. Wife Natalia has been off work since his diagnosis as she had been caring for Ed around the clock. Now, with the added expenses surrounding this inexplicable loss, along with the weight of abruptly becoming a widowed mother of two, Natalia will need the help and support of many as she and her daughters learn to continue life without a husband and father.Countless people who loved Ed have reached out to ask, “What can we do to help?” Your donations – no matter how big or small - is a way to help Ed’s grieving family as they navigate their way across the next few months. While Natalia would NEVER ask for financial assistance, I can promise it would be greatly appreciated. This campaign has been given a new purpose; the intent of this fundraiser is now to “Help the McPhee’s Heal”. Thank you again for your unwavering support – it means the world to the McPhee family.Celebration of Life for Ed McPheeSaturday, August 25, 20186:00 PM – 11:30 PMHMCS NCSM Nonsuch11807 Kingsway Avenue, Edmonton, AlbertaEd was an incredibly special man that left a lasting impression on anyone and everyone he met. He was deeply and dearly loved by an abundance of family and friends. He lived life to the fullest with a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eye. In honor of the way he lived, his family has planned a celebration of life, to be held this Saturday, August 25th from 6:00 PM to 11:30 PM. Please visit  https://www.facebook.com/events/233443364037898 for additional details and to confirm attendance.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Life can change in an instant.These words rang loud and clear for the McPhee family just 3 weeks ago when Ed, suspecting he was experiencing symptoms of a simple food intolerance, was suddenly and unexpectedly diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon Cancer.In an instant life was turned upside down for Ed, wife Natalia, and daughters McKenzie (11) and Kiersten (13). Suddenly, promises of carefree summer days and exciting family adventures were replaced with shock, stress, uncertainty and immense fear of what lay ahead in the days, weeks, months to come. In an instant, Ed went from being in seemingly good health to learning that not only did he have colon cancer, but that the cancer had spread to his spine, liver, pancreas and spleen. Due to its complexity, the treatment plan will be long and exhausting. Having already undergone an ileostomy, Ed is now in the process of starting chemotherapy and radiation. Once this part of treatment is complete, doctors will then go in to remove the grapefruit-sized tumor from his intestine. Because Ed will be unable to return to work and will be in need of his wife’s continuous support emotionally, mentally and physically during this time, the McPhee family will undoubtedly be impacted financially by this devastating disease.As family and friends learn of this news, many are reaching out to offer help and support in any way that they can. Those that would like to make monetary contributions in support of the McPhee family as they say “F*CK CANCER!""  can easily and safely do so through this fundraising platform.

Happy birthday beautiful girl. She is a loving daughter, granddaughter, sister, niece, cousin, and friend. She loves cheerleading, swimming, and her friends. Krystal has a brother (Rylan) and a sister (Kaylee) on her moms side of the family and a sister (Jackie) on her dads side of the family. Krystal is fighting for her life.December 26th, 2017:My niece Krystal was finishing up with her school cheerleading as she continued to complain of constant knee pain. Her knee appeared to be swollen so her mother Allison scheduled her an appointment to get her into the dr. Allison and I brought her to the dr where they believed she had a minor injury to her knee from cheering and referred her to physical therapy to see if that would help. Krystal was placed on crutches and expected to stay off her left leg to help reduce the swelling.January 11th, 2018:Krystal had been staying off her leg and we noticed the swelling still hadn’t gone down. She attended her physical therapy session where her physical therapist showed high concerns about the swelling in Krystal’s left knee. She insisted that we go in and see an orthopedic surgeon IMMEDIATELY! Before Krystal and Allison left her physical therapy session Allison made sure to have her appointment scheduled the next day with Dr. Kauffman an orthopedic surgeon for Northwestern Hospital.January 12th, 2018:The day our entire universe changed....1:30pm- Allison was unable to take time off work so she asked her Aunt Cathy to bring Krystal to her orthopedic appointment. She held her phone close by incase any questions needed to be answered. When arriving at Dr. Kauffmans office they did an X-ray of both of Krystal’s knees. A dark gray area showed up on Krystal’s left knee. Dr. Kauffman stepped out of the room to review the images and upon arriving he told Aunt Cathy and Krystal that he cannot discuss any results without Allison on the phone. While at work, Allison stepped away to take a phone call that would shatter her entire world. Dr. Kauffman explained that he was VERY concerned about her knee. The X-ray images are showing cells rapidly growing in her knee and that an MRI was needed to find out where exactly these cells are and how bad it really is. He then proceeded to say that he was going to place a referral for Dr. Peabody and Dr. Attar who are Orthopedic ONCOLOGISTS.... that one word is when Allison’s heart skipped a million beats and the tears started flowing. Dr. Kauffman then explained that he will not let Krystal leave his office until she gets scheduled for an MRI.3pm- Krystal, Aunt Cathy, her mom Allison, and her dad Miguel all arrived at the radiology department for the MRI. Krystal wanted Allison to be there during the MRI so the radiology tech took them both back while everyone waited in the waiting room. Krystal started her MRI and did so good reguardless of how scarred she was. She enjoyed listening to today’s hits in her head phones. For her, she still had no idea what was going on or what this all meant. Allison stood back by the radiology tech where she was able to see all the images that were being taken. Tears rolling down her face, she knew it didn’t look good. Krystal then needed to have contrast added. Allison was so worried with how she would handle the injection of die. Allison stood by her side, holding her hand, assuring everything would be ok. Krystal handled it like a CHAMP! We were so proud of her! After the MRI was all said and done we were heading out of the building and Dr. Kauffman was already calling Allison and Miguel with the results. Relentless to wanting to pick up the phone, they sat in the main lobby to hear the results. Dr. Kauffman stated that it appeared to be what he thought it was, a TUMOR. He said that Krystal needs to get to the oncologist immediately and that his staff was coordinating the day (January 18th, 2018) to get downtown where they will do a biopsy to see what stage she is and if it has spread to any other parts of the body. He stated he has no reason to believe that it has spread but we won’t know until she has further imaging. He advised to take time off work and spend as much time with Krystal as possible. -The next 72 hours have been emotional to say the least. They say when someone in the family has cancer, everybody has cancer. That statement couldn’t be more true. We have had an enormous amount of people reaching out with such kind encouraging words, asking how they could help, and delivering meals to Krystal’s house to help eliminate one less worry. I have made this go fund me account to help my niece Krystal and her family afford the endless amount of medical bills heading their way, maintain their house payments, care for Krystal’s siblings, transportation/parking, and to put food on the table. No family should have to battle cancer alone!

The pediatrician believed Caden was suffering from Nystagmus, a condition in which one’s eyes make repetitive, un-controlled movements from side to side.  Caden was referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist, who saw him the very next day.  The ophthalmologist confirmed the Nystagmus but determined it was not caused by anything having to do specifically with Caden’s vision or eyes.  Katie and Chris were told to bring Caden to Fairfax Hospital for a CT right away, bypassing INOVA Loudoun for fear if there was any significant treatment, Loudoun would not be able to accommodate.  Katie, Chris and Caden were rushed in to a CT moments after arriving at the ER at INOVA Fairfax Hospital. The CT was read quickly and within an hour of arriving, the ER doctor was notifying Katie and Chris that their son had a tumor on his brain and it measured 4cm, a very large mass for anyone, let alone 6 month old, Caden.  The tumor was sitting directly in the middle of Caden’s brain, this was obviously the cause of the Nystagmus. Caden was immediately admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Children’s Fairfax Hospital where he, Katie and Chris remain today.  It was quickly apparent that Caden would soon be undergoing brain surgery in an attempt to remove as much of the tumor as possible as well as to diagnose exactly what type of tumor this is.  After more tests and MRIs Caden was brought in to surgery on the morning of Friday, January 20 around 7:00am.  Surgery was scheduled to take 4-6 hours per the surgeons estimate.  Katie and Chris along with their parents waited patiently for each update from the operating room.  Updates were expected every two hours during surgery – the first one finally came about 2.5-3 hours from when Caden went in – everything was progressing as planned.  The updates continued to come as the hours continued to pass.  After 11 hours, Caden was out of surgery!  A long, grueling day for the family indeed.  Finally, they were able to see Caden! Shortly after surgery, Caden began having seizures – multiple seizures each day for the first few days post-op.  This is not completely out of the ordinary after one goes through the extensive brain surgery had just come through, however, difficult for all involved.Katie and Chris were told that the pathology results which may help identify the type of tumor could take 7-10 business days before they were returned.  The wait was not that long and came back on Thursday – the diagnosis of the tumor is PNET (Primitive neuroectodermal tumor), a malignant, obviously aggressive tumor. During surgery the doctor was able to remove a significant amount of the tumor, however there is still a long road ahead to attack and hopefully kill the remaining malignant cells.  The next course of treatment will be 9 months of chemotherapy.  Katie and Chris will be with Caden at Children’s in Fairfax for one week out of the month for the next 9 months.  The other 3 weeks per month will be spent at home, essentially providing Caden time to recover from the last and prepare for the next round of chemo.The doctors and family agree this is the best course of action in hopes of eliminating this tumor.  There will inevitably be ups and downs along the way.  One of those I have not yet mentioned was a curveball thrown just hours before Caden’s 6 month pediatrician visit when Katie was laid off from her job.  The hopes of sharing this story is to help relieve one of many burdens facing Katie, Chris, Sydney, Laynie, Caden and family.  During chemo, Chris will have to take time from work, where his paid time off will be expiring any day now.  If we can help this family who has been there for so many of us in our times of need, big or small – it would be so incredibly appreciated.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me through the site.I have started with the amount of $25,000 as we really have no idea what to expect. Chris and Katie have made is crystal clear that if any money raised exceeds the needs of Caden’s care, it will be donated to cancer research in Caden’s name. As always, thoughts and prayers are so graciously accepted as well!",46007bf80afd5d943165b5fe92c5acbe,34,1.37572,720.0,6,1,general,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

Everyone that knows Kannon knows him to be a very sweet, silly and kind hearted young man. He has always been very active whether he was participating in recreational sports, school sports, or just activities around the house or with friends.  In March, he started to develop a lump on the back of his leg that was thought to be just a cyst.  On 4/12 he went in for surgery to remove the abscess, and tests were ran on it.  On 4/18 when he went back for a follow up post surgery, he was told that at just 15 years old, he had been diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma (bone cancer).  Ewing's Sarcoma is an extremely rare cancer that typically affects children and young adults.  While it is most commonly found within the bones, Kannon's has been found within his soft tissue. His treatment for this will require multiple rounds of chemotherapy, then surgery, then more rounds of chemo.  He will be admitted 2/3 days for treatment, and then the following week of treatment for 5 days.  This is estimated to continue for about 6-8 months. His treatment is not close to home, and his parents own and run their own company back in their resident city.  However with this going on, of course Kannon is their main priority so they are spending every moment they can with him at home, at the hospital and at all appointments.  With that said, any donations from family/friends/the community would be GREATLY appreciated to help with any medical/travel expenses.  Although he is still at the beginning of his long journey, he is already fighting like a bull! He is such a positive, determined, and enthusiastic young man.  He knows he can beat this, especially with all the love and support he has gotten from everyone around him.  He is strong and he will remain #KannonFierce!

My awesomely brave sister Alice is included in this statistic, diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer earlier in July. We all have a story to tell; you know, those ones that just completely throw your life upside down, and hers is just crazy. Alice has been living in Indonesia the last 2.5 years developing a career in the regions disaster management sector and in her spare time falling in love with her now husband Danu. Two days before Alice and Danu tied the knot on the 11th June, trying on her wedding dress (Kebaya) for the final time, she found a lump in her right breast. After an initial consultation with a local GP and then an oncologist, she was confidently told by both professionals that her cancer was benign; nothing to worry about, ‘this happens all the time’. Following up with a second opinion, Alice and Danu travelled to Singapore and after some rigorous tests, she was diagnosed with a very real and aggressive tumour. Not the most expected news, given prior diagnoses. Nor with the knowledge that only a week or two prior, Alice and Danu also found out they were pregnant. Alice chose to return to Australia for treatment and since returning in early August has been embraced by a rockstar medical team including a breast cancer surgeon, oncologist, breast care nurse, social worker, obstetrician and midwife. Which we all can/t thank enough.It was all hands on deck, including their determination to fight this while keeping the pregnancy. Something Alice and Danu were informed back in Singapore would not be a possibility to continue. After her first surgery in late August to remove the tumour, histopathology found the lump was a lot bigger, a whole 5.3cm bigger, than originally measured in the tests, of around 2cm. A second surgery followed in early September to remove a larger margin – or non-cancerous tissue – around the removed tumour. Better to be sure! Histopathology results found at this point that the removed margins were riddled with an inconsistent pattern of tumorous “nests”. Given it was clear that going in for more surgery was a fruitless venture, aside now a mastectomy, and also safely developing beyond the first trimester of pregnancy, Alice has now commenced chemotherapy treatment. Chemo will continue now for the next 6 to 7 months with the intent to stop it at her 35th week of pregnancy in early February to provide her and bubs the best chance for a normal birth untainted or exposed to any chemo. Then back into it. A mastectomy, completion of the chemo and then a course of radiation therapy. In a nutshell. When she’s good, she’s pretty good. When she’s going through her post-chemo (of what she calls) “drano” periods, she’s pretty well knocked out. Having never been pregnant nor ever had chemo, she undergoes an ongoing guessing game between what is pregnancy nausea and symptoms, and what is a result of the chemo. But on she persists. So, now I would like to do my bit to help. In honour of everything my sister has been going through and the uphill battle that she still has, I will raising funds from all you amazing people and in return from all your love I will be shaving my head, where 100% of the proceeds with go to the Andrew Love Cancer Centre where Alice is being treated, to ensure they keep doing an amazing job into the future as they have done to date with my sister Alice.

Our daughter, Ariana Farragut, was your normal fun, crazy, sweet little girl 25 days ago on November 10, 2014. On Nov. 11 she was playing and hit her head. Not a big deal, so we thought. That night, Ariana started walking funny and vomiting a lot. We immediately thought concussion, but we waited to see how she was the next day.The next morning Nov 12 we took her to the pediatrician, and we were sent to the hospital for a CT to rule out a concussion.  At that time, we were so worried it was a concussion... Little did we know!The CT showed a possible cyst or tumor in her brain. We were given a few choices on places for an MRI, as kids have to be sedated. We decided on Children's hospital in New Orleans, in case it was worse-case scenario. We were admitted through the ER at Children's  that afternoon... They took us straight to the cancer floor without telling us anything, and I almost threw up. I told Lee it must be a mistake and the other rooms were full... After a lot of talks with doctors, our heads spinning, we were told it was a tumor, and it would need to be operated on, BUT at the moment we had a bigger issue. The CT showed so much fluid on the brain, Ariana needed immediate surgery to put in an exterior ventricular drain. That surgery was about 5:30 or 6 on Nov 12.  We met with our neurosurgeon, and he showed us and told us the tumor was LARGE. It was also attached to important high-functioning areas of the brain. Then she had a brain surgery on Nov 18 to try to get the tumor out. She made it through surgery wonderfully.  Doctors, nurses, everyone was pleasantly surprised. We had an MRI the next day.... To see how the tumor looked... And we got the news that 1/3 of the tumor remained. Dr. Roberts felt that he could get more out if he went in a second time, and so we put our trust in that.Ariana's second brain surgery was Nov 20. Dr Roberts knew he got all he could, but that some still remained.  After THAT MRI,  we found out 20% is still in there.We got her oncology report Nov. 21, 2014 on Ariana's 2nd birthday. She was diagnosed with ATRT, a VERY rare, malignant, stage 4 cancer.  We knew we needed the best treatment possible, so we reached out to St Jude.Ariana's pressures were great, so they turned off the EVD. Then, the CTs were good, so they took out the EVD.  She was sweating from all the steroids and antibiotics, or so we thought... We later found out she was leaking brain fluid from her stitches...and so she had her FOURTH surgery on Dec.5 to put in a shunt. She also got a virus while in the hospital. We have now been here 23 days, 13 in ICU, and we HOPE to be well enough to go to St. Jude SOON! We need treatment, and we need it fast.---Ariana has since had 2 more surgeries- a port and another tumor resection. (Total of 6 surgeries) She has had 4 months of high dose IV chemo, 6 weeks of proton radiation to the brain, and 6 months of oral maintenance chemo. She has had several seizures and a lot of neuropathic pain. She is not cancer-free, but she WILL be! Please help us as we help Ariana FIGHT for her life!iWe appreciate everything, and we are especially grateful for the prayers... You ALL will help us win this fight...much love-- The Farraguts",8ce57f2a317588169ea2c03733b6fcd2,34,0.6076,1500.0,4,1,general,0,3,0,2,0,0.00473186119873817,0.0,0.9504310344827587,4.629714776459695,0.0,gofundme

This Go Fund Me is in support of my best friend, my soulmate, my partner in crime Rush. Here is our storyWednesday our world turned upside down. We woke up in the morning and said our ""I love yous and have a great day"" and went about our day. At 4 pm, Rush and I spoke on the phone and he told me that he wasn't feeling well and was going home. This, if you know Rush, is not normal. I headed home to meet him and found him shivering uncontrollably. As we were talking and he was telling me his symptoms, he started to have a seizure. It was intense, I called 911 and stayed on the phone while we waited for it to pass. After about a minute of checking his breathing and thinking the worst was over- a second seizure hit- this one just as intense as the first one. As the amazing team of help arrived, it took us what felt like a lifetime to be able to get him stable enough to take him to the hospital. As he regained consciousness, he was confused and unaware of what happened. In true Baba style- his entire family was there in a matter of minutes. What we heard next was unexpected... They had found a mass on his right side of the brain measuring 13mm in size- we were being transferred to the Med Center. We arrived at the Med Center, were treated with a fantastic staff that had already assembled the Neuro team and were ready to do further testing. We were admitted in to the Neurology ICU unit. It was all a whirlwind- really felt more like a crazy dream. The next day, the team came in and told us initial findings. Surgery was needed- we needed more imaging to map out the brain, and everything seemed like it was although bad news- it was the best case scenario for what we were dealing with. Friday we would meet with the best of the best that would actually be doing the procedures. What came next was the scariest thing that we could have heard. Friday we learned that it looks like we are fighting a big fight. Rush has what seems to be a stage 3 Glioblastoma. To put it in perspective- it is the most aggressive types of brain cancer that you can have. John McCain had it, and it is the second most common type of brain cancer that is out there. Most people that get this have a survival rate of 1-3 years. As I type this, I need a moment to let that sink in.Despite this, we have a few things to our advantage. He is healthy. He has minimal symptoms leading up to the seizures. He is under the age of 40. He is strong willed and strong physically. He is a fighter and has serious will power and mental strength. If you know his story- you know that this is all true. Because of all of this, we are asking for your help. We are ready to fight this. No matter what the outcome is- we are not going down without a fight. but we need your help. We don't know how much this is going to cost. We have had many friends offer to set this up for us, but we wanted to use this as an opportunity to tell our story. His story and his journey with this battle. I know in my heart that he is not a statistic. He is not the 1-3 year average. I know in my heart that God is not done with him yet- he has not fulfilled his purpose yet. We are asking for your kind donation to help us fight this cause- weather it is in financial help, in prayer, in small acts of kindness, in an uplifting word. Any help in any way is appreciated. We are humbling ourselves in knowing that in our weakest moments is when God does his best work.

So my personal thanks to everyone who donated to such an amazing cause.  

Having lost my mum, Trish, 12 years ago, from Ovarian Cancer at the age of 57, I  would like to give a little something back, so I have recently decided to dive in and join the Border Ovarian Cancer Awareness Group (BOCAG).  


One of BOCAG's major fundraisers for the year, is the Skydive day, which will be held on the weekend of 4th March, 2017.  (Oh goodness - help me......yikes) 


So I ask for you to help out and please give a donation to this amazing group of women who have been volunteering their time and raising funds on the Border to support and educate the women of our community on disease prevention of the insidieous silent killer. 


Many of you know, and many of you may not know, that I have been heavily involved in organising some very successful Girls Night In events, here in Wodonga,  raising over $35,000 over 4 years. So, this my friends is my fundraising event for this year. 


Thankyou from the bottom of my heart.

I was diagnosed with Stage II Breast Cancer at 26 and it recurred as Stage IV in my bones & lungs at 29. I am going into my 5th year living with stage IV and 8th year with Cancer. I want to say THANK YOU for everyone who has helped me emotionally, supported my side businesses, and my family & my fiance for always trying to help. Cancer has literally taken a toll on me financially - from significant medical debt, costs of treatments, and costs of hollistic care (which I truly believe have helped keep me healthy despite cancer). If you know me, I am usually one to not ask for help. I will trudge along and do it myself until the going gets rough. Now the going has gotten rough. I have always had 2 jobs, paid my bills, and was typically doing well financially.  I had to quit my second job about 2yrs ago. I couldn't handle a 60+hour work week. Then I went out on 9months of medical leave. I was doing ""OK"" financially, white knuckling it and doing so many odd jobs to make ends meet. Finally I went back to work in winter 2015 after taking a 7mo break from work, but was hit with an unexpected need for radiation. The radiation took a lot from me, I had 3 bone spots radiated with chemotherapy, and I was been left with relatively low fatigue and permanent acid reflux and digestive issues. I could not work 100%. I worked at 80%, just enough to pay all my bills at the minimum payments with no frills. Sadly due to more treatment progression, cancer in my brain, and treatment side effects I have officially left my job, I loved on 5/31/17. I am on LTD and SSD, but it honestly is 50% of what I used to make prior to 6/1/17. We also now have to pay for COBRA, which as everyone knows is expensive. Kyle has OBAMACARE and we cannot risk putting me on that with how the government has been trying to change the ACA. Now I am literally in the red. Most of my money goes into rent, our only car, and the payments of copays, vitamins, and medications.  I still am unable to pay for my copays and vitamins sometimes and the bills rack up. Those methods previously mentioned are what brings me to this GoFundMe. All in hopes that someone - somewhere - can help me maintain residually optimum health and not have to strain myself physically and mentally by looking for another job. I am currently unable to work to debiliating fatigue and onset of recent Brain Tumor in November 2015 & a 40day stay in the ICU in September 2017 due to immunotherapy s/e and lung progression. Most of my money goes into my daily my bills, medical bills, and naturopathic treatments (which are costly), and with whatever income my husband pulls through. He has had to take less work to be my 24/hr caretaker many times & was out of work Jan 2017-April 2017 & has been out of work since July 2017 to the present to be my 24/7 Caretaker, he does not get FMLA as he is a freelancer & has been collecting unemployment from NY State.I do not qualify for Medicaid. Kyle is on Obamacare, which does not cover doctors outside of NJ & all my providers are in NYC. I cannot afford to risk my life and change oncologists because of health insurance issues. We will be paying close to 1,400 in Cobra a month to pay for my treatment, to keep me alive... yep, that seriously is like 2 weeks worth of pay for some people.I do get SSD and LTD, but it only covers the Cobra Insurance, my portion of the rent and some of my medical costs. The rest of my bills go in this pile I call ""figure it out another day"" and thats about it. Kyle also is not loaded with cash, so he unfortunately cannot pay all of these bills and debts for me. He had to drain his savings to stay afloat when he did not work Jan 2017 - April 2017 to care for me at home & then re-drained it again from July 2017 - present. My savings account is also on the verge of hitting 0 as of 2018. The funds from the GoFundMe have run out. I have used the money to pay medical debt, bills, food to stay alive, and copays to my doctors for treatment. Thank you all for the encouragement and standing alongside me in my healing journey! I truly believe this is NOT what is in the cards for me, but I do the best I can. THANK YOU ALL for taking time to read this.HX OF CARE:9/30/10 - ER/PR+ HER2- Stage 2 Metastatic Breast @ 26 yrs old EARLY STAGE TREATMENTS: Bilateral Mastectomy with 2 Reconstructive Surgeries16 Sessions of Chemotherapy - Adriamycin & Cytoxan x4 and 12 sessions of weekly Taxol28 Sessions of Radiation to Clavicle, chest wall and breast skin2 years on Tamoxifen6yrs of Lymphedema Treatment for Left ArmMETASTATIC DISEASE TREATMENTSAREAS WITH METASTATIC DISEASE 7/28/13 - ER/PR+ HER2- Stage 4 w/ metastasis to: Left Pleural Lining of Left Lung - 2013Left Hip Illiac Joint - 2014Spine : T3-T7, T11, L1-L3, Sacrum - 2014 & 2015Sternum - 2016Small Spots on Liver Surface - 2015 & 2017Both Ovaries - 2015Brain - 2016Perionetium - 2015 & 2017TREATMENTS THUS FAR: and OUTCOME:Radiation TherapiesApril 2015 & April 2016 Radiation to ever bone metastis region within the last 12mo - stayed clear of cancer, but left with deformed bones, low WBC and muscular painDecember 2016 Radiation to my brain - 9 spots of the 11 they found: left me with hair loss, fatigue and word recall issuesMore Brain Radiation - April 2017 - radiation to the leftover 2 spots from December 2016 & 2 new spots with more hair loss!! yayJuly 2017 - More brain radiation to another spot with targeted radiation.

We always were told to not talk about ourselves and our problems outside of the home, because ""everyone has their own problems to deal with,"" and ""there's always someone else who has had it worse,"" and ""we've been blessed in so many ways"", and ""it's important to remain and look strong"". Yes, while all of these things may be true, sometimes it's okay to let others in. Sometimes it's necessary. Sometimes, when you think your family has been through enough bad to last a lifetime, you feel so blindsided that you need to reach out and ask for help, and share your story, or you'll drown. On Friday, March 23, 2018, after my 29 year old twin brother told me that he was diagnosed with cancer, I knew that now was the time for me to finally share our family's story and reach out for help. Now, more than ever, we need the help of others to remain strong through this time, as my brother battles cancer, and as I watch yet another person whom I love go through this fight. This page is for my brother while he battles cancer. But in order to fully understand who we are, who he is, I want to tell our whole story, from the beginning. Since I’m terrible at dealing with emotional issues when speaking to others, and even worse at opening up enough to appear vulnerable or weak, writing is the only and best way that I know how to tell the most raw, honest story of our lives, from my eyes, anyway. Only after I pour my heart out onto this webpage can I humbly ask for everyone’s help during this difficult time, because we need kindness and support to help us endure this battle, once again.  So here I go.The profile picture on this website shows my twin brother, Bill, and I on Christmas morning, 2011. My brother and I have witnessed so much illness and death for our age, in my opinion, but this two-minute-older dude and I have preserved and have had each other’s backs during the hardest times.. and although you'd think I'd have learned better by now, I never once imagined that the person with whom I shared my mother’s womb may also fall victim to, and be forced to stand up against my #1 enemy, whom I shall name here for theatrical literary purposes, The Cancer Villain. This Villain first invited himself into our home when my brother and I were four years old, and it has taunted us continually with each passing year since then. On July 15, 1993, the day after her 41st birthday, our mother was diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, and was given a 50% chance to live. For three months following that, she lived in Columbus, Ohio, going through chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, fighting to survive. We were not allowed to see her other than through her window, because kids just generally carry more germs than adults, and her immune system was too low to risk being in close proximity of us. I don't remember much since we were so young at the time, but I do remember standing outside of the Columbus hospital, looking up at the hospital room window and being told to wave hello to her. Our older sister, at age 15, was forced to step into the role of the mother of two very confused and upset kids. She was too young to have to grow up so soon, but she did anyway, and she took on the responsibility beautifully, with the help of many supportive family members and friends. We were lucky to have such a strong and loving sister with us during that scary time. In the end and by some miracle, our mother survived, and was finally able to come home, but the road to recovery was not quick or fun for her, as she was forced to remain isolated from us for three more long months, where she resided next door at my grandmother's house, waving to us from her bedroom window. She told me a few years back that for a very long time, I was afraid of her and wouldn't say hi to her, because I didn’t recognize this bald stranger trying to comfort me. I cannot imagine how awful that must have been for her. After spending two more years in recovery mode, she was finally allowed to go back to work. She remained in remission for years and life was mostly back to normal for us. Then, nine years after her first diagnosis, in 2002, the Villain came knocking on our family’s door once more, and with it he brought back her Leukemia. Because of her age and her body already having endured the harshness of chemotherapy before, it was decided that chemo a second time may end up killing her before the cancer could, and so she was put on a medication, called Gleevec, that keeps her white blood cell count under control, but does not ever rid her body of the cancer that has already manifested inside of her. To present day today, she lives each day with Leukemia, but you would never be able to tell if you saw her. She lives life to the fullest and looks healthy, on the outside, at least. It has been a little over 15 years now, and her body continues to accept the drugs. While this is amazing news, the thought and terror associated with the idea that one day her body will become immune to the drug and she will have to start a new regimen and hope that it is successful in keeping the cancer at bay is constantly in the back of our minds.. like a ticking time bomb, we all are waiting at a standstill, not knowing when the timer will go off... but until then, we live life in the moment and appreciate the time that we have together. She truly is the strongest person I know. And the Villain remained in the background, planting his feet in our home, while we went on with our lives, trying to forget about him, the best that we could.As if worrying about our mother for most of our lives wasn't bad enough, our unwanted and unwelcome Villain decided that he didn't want to remain in the background any longer, and so he chose another member of our family to target, and this time it was our dad, which took us all by total and utter surprise. This news came to us in summer of 2014, when my dad complained of a stomachache one day and brushed it off, thinking it was gall stones again, a problem he struggled with from time to time throughout the years. None of us even questioned it, because it made perfect sense. So he scheduled a doctors appointment for what he thought was stones, only to find out one September afternoon that he had Stage 4 cancer in the stomach region, but with no way of knowing the origin of the cancer since it had already spread throughout his entire abdominal area. My own Daddy, the very same man whom I’ve never even known to have a cold before, was dying, and it was all happening out of the blue and very quickly. When you are used to worrying about one ill parent your entire life, you forget to even consider the idea that something bad could also happen to the other. We were all in total shock. My dad especially. He thought he was going to live forever. He used to joke about it, except I guess I sort of actually believed him, because there was just no way the Villain would come for both parents... it was just absurd to even think such a horrible thought! Going through my dad’s battle with cancer was when I finally came to realize that it’s not the actual devastation that rips your heart into pieces, it’s the hope that we all blindly and ignorantly cling onto, even when we all know what’s coming in the end, but no one wants to say it out loud. We just wanted to believe that maybe, by another miracle, he would just one day wake up better or his cancer would start reversing and one day he'd be completely healed. The masochistic games our minds play on us when we just don't want to handle the truth are truly impressive. Even when I thought I was mentally ready for the end to come, I learned that you can genuinely never prepare for the loss of a loved one.. and my dad was, and still is, my world. My brother and I had more amazing adventures with him than most people have in a lifetime with their parents, and for that I am deeply grateful, but it doesn’t take away or even lessen the pain and sadness I still feel 3.5 years after his passing. After only a short 10 weeks of being diagnosed, on November 22nd, 2014, our father passed away in the middle of the night, just moments after my mom decided to finally shut her eyes to rest for a minute or two in my dad’s hospital room. He waited for her to fall asleep, and then he left us, not wanting any of us to have to watch him go, protecting us until his last minute of life on this earth. Typical Dad move. I will never forget that morning and the phone call I received from my mother, or how cold it was that day, snowing and icy and miserable. After the call, I remember running outside and sitting down in the freezing cold snow. I still don’t know if I became numb from the weather or from the inside out, but probably both. I was the one who made the call to my sweet, loving brother. He wouldn’t even answer the phone for so long, because he knew there was only one reason I'd be calling so early, and he wasn’t ready to hear it. It was the saddest day of my life so far, and that sadness remains just as strong now as it did on that day. My brother and my dad were best friends and did everything together. While I was his little baby princess, those two were two peas in a pod. My heart broke most for Bill on that sad, awful day that changed our lives and hearts forever. On that day, the Villain moved back into the background, and allowed us some time to grieve.With all bad comes some good, as that is the natural order of things. Before our dad passed away, we were introduced to our older half brother, Dan, who we never knew we had. In the last weeks of his life, Dan and my dad bonded as they should have for the last 43 years of Dan's life. It’s unfortunate that certain situations don’t always happen the way that you think they should, but my dad's death brought Dan's family into our lives, and if there was any small blessing hidden within that tragic event, it was this. Even though he was not raised by my dad, it is crazy to watch Dan as he mimics mannerisms of our father without even knowing that he's doing it. It truly is crazy how that all works. I am so happy to have him and his family in our lives now, as he has helped carry on and strengthen our father's memory, even in times when things were looking very dark and bleak for me. I will be forever grateful of this.As the years went by, we all adapted to life without our dad. Not a day goes by that I don't miss him, and it never ""gets better"" as the years pass, as so many people used to tell me. Time does not actually heal all wounds, but rather, you just become better at dealing with the pain. And though I'll never agree, our Villain decided that enough time had passed to emerge front and center back into our lives and demand attention once more. This time, my twin brother became the target.On March 23, my brother told me that he was diagnosed with cancer. Early prognosis was Hodgkin's Lymphoma, which has a very good survival rate, and so even though this was devastating news for my family, everyone seemed hopeful that this cancer would be cured and over with quickly and easily. Me, being the dark and dreary one, saw the familiar glimmer of hope in everyones’ voices and silently waited for the other shoe to drop. This drop occurred when we received Bill's final results. While he does, in fact, have Hodgkin's Lymphoma, he also has non-Hodgkin's Large B-cell Lymphoma, as well. Who knew you could have two different types at one time? I don't know why I continue to be surprised by this kind of news, but I do. This news came to him on Friday, April 6th, and on Tuesday, April 10th, they will put a port into his chest and then begin the first of multiple, aggressive rounds of 144-hour long chemotherapy the following day (04/11/18). He will then get 15 days of rest and recuperation, then the next 144-hour chemo will begin. During this time, all that we can do is wait and hope and pray, and then hope and wait and pray some more.Here is what I want to come from me telling our story: During this time, I want Bill to focus on nothing but fighting this cancer. During this time, I don't want him to stress about the hospital bills piling up, or about the normal, everyday bills piling up, or about whether or not he will have a job after all of this, or about ANYTHING AT ALL. I want him to focus on getting better and staying postive through this crappy hand of cards he's been dealt. So this is why I've started this GoFundMe page as he begins his first round of chemo. It is my hope and goal that after this first 144 hours of what I can only imagine to be a traumatic, terrifying and lonely experience, I can surprise my brother and ease a bit of his stress by showing him this website and showing him cold, hard cash donated to him to help him afford bills and daily living expenses while he conquers this Villain! My hope is that through this page and the donations coming in to support him, he will see all of the people that are there for him and for our family, and that will give him the extra boost of courage and strength that he may at some point need during this battle to want to continue on. Do you think you can help me with that? Anything, no matter the amount, I believe will truly help, and will also touch all of my family’s hearts forever. In addition, I know that it will help Bill stay positive as he views this page and all of the donations from all of you amazing supporters. I know that he will be touched deeply by the goodness of people that want to help and support him. I plan to withdraw the funds and help him figure out bills while I am with him during his second round of chemo, and then I’d like to start paying whatever billers he decides need paid off, from highest priority to least priority. That way, he will just be able to focus on healing, while my mom and I pay his bills with the help of your donations, and it is my hope that when he completes his final round of chemo he will not have to worry about mass amounts of bills that are either past due or due ASAP. I think that he will truly benefit enormously from your donations and my family’s efforts to deal with the billers now so that he won’t have to later. Please show your support for my brother during this difficult time, and help him fight through this battle against our longtime enemy, so we can put this Villain back into the shadows for good, where he belongs.My love and sincerest gratitude goes out to all of those who are reading this,Sincerely,Katie EggerHere some more photos of us if you still feel like scrolling :)￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼",a8b5b17d42c0d255f3d54b0a3053b670,94,0.867,270.0,5,1,mixed,0,12,0,5,0,0.004235792446170138,0.0,0.06536572052401747,28.03468711088362,0.0,gofundme

Because she was only 40, it was recommended that she have a double mastectomy to prevent the cancer from coming back in the other breast later on in life.  In addition, all of the lymph nodes were removed from her left side. After surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, reconstructive surgery, and two additional surgeries due to complications with the radiated tissue during the healing process, we were finally past this physical/mental/emotional battle. Her cancer had been Triple positive: positive for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2. Hormone therapy treatments can help prevent a return of the disease so she has been on a medication called tamoxifen which helps stop cancer from coming back by blocking hormone receptors. However, we've recently found that she has now developed cancer in several bones and also in her liver, derived from the original cancer and also triple positive. And so our journey begins all over again. But this time, the financial commitment is much greater. She will be taking an aromatase inhibitor to actually stop estrogen production and force her body into menopause. Update: medications have changed. “Ibrance” has not been FDA approved for mom’s type of cancer. Starting intravenous therapy and eventually surgery will take place to remove her ovaries and further reduce hormone-responsive growth.Any amount in donation helps.

Many of you are friends and family and know her but some of you have know idea who she is or much about what her recent diagnosis is .Elizabeth has 2 beautiful babies, Elijah Grey (Age 9) and Elana Rose (Age 3). Elizabeth is only 31 years old. She lost her Medical Coding job, the sole support for her family, in October 2018. She immediately became very ill with one thing after another which made it extremely challenging to look for, much less, find work. It’s important for me to tell you how this all came about because at the end of the day, its going to help somebody, somewhere at sometime. So how did we get from a lump felt for the first time a few days before December 17th to starting 5 months of Chemo on January 13, 2019? On December 17th, Elizabeth sent me a text about the lump she just felt..... I was there later that day and felt it …… literally FELT it. It was a lump, 1 o’clock position of right breast and I remember saying, “Yeah you need a Mamo”… We have NO family history of Cancer. Our family genetics are Heart Disease. So although the size alarmed me, having no history of cancer and the fact that Elizabeth has breastfed continuously for 9 years, the likelihood of breast cancer was minimal… at least that’s what I kept telling myself. You may or may not know that breastfeeding is supposed to be one way to keep breast cancer out of the picture!Elizabeth has had Celiac Disease for 15 years and statistics show that this disease is usually followed by other autoimmune diseases if you don’t take care of yourself. Wednesday afternoon, December 19th, we went to a walk-in clinic in so we could get an order for a Mammogram and ultrasound. Just like that … boom, boom, boom! Mammogram, Ultrasound, Biopsy in a matter of days one after another. It appeared with the rapid scheduling of events that the Doctors thought speed was of importance. Monday, January 7th at 8:55am, as I was pulling in to take Elana, my 3-year-old Grandbaby to gymnastics, I got a text from Elizabeth, “Call me asap” and I knew!She got the call … “Its cancer and we want to get you in today to go over everything and get your treatment plan started…. are you available at 1:00 P.M TODAY?” Here’s what they found:A. Large lump … Triple Negative Invasive Mammary Carcinoma. B. Small lump…. Estrogen and Progesterone Fed Invasive Mammary Carcinoma C. Lymphnode biopsy showed small amount of tumor cells.The amazing Nurse already had our appointments scheduled for us as they slipped Elizabeth into scheduling spots immediately for:1. Surgeon2. Oncologist3. MRI4. Genetic testing5. Port Insertion for Chemotherapy.6. CT Scan - Added by Oncologist during that appointment7. Echocardiogram - Added by Oncologist during that appointment. Thursday, January 17, the first of 5 months of Chemo began. Once chemo is complete, she will have a double mastectomy and will not be able to work while she is being treated. Elizabeth and the kids have moved in with us so we can care for everyone while she is going through her treatment. Elizabeth has government insurance which is a blessing but that is all we have in order to support her through this. This fundraiser is to help with the following:1. The extensive supplemental treatments 2. Alternative therapies that will only be possible with the support of others3. Acupuncture4. Massage5. Biomat6. Enemas 7. Wig for when her hair falls out in a couple weeks. She just recently cut her hair off and was going to donate it to a child with cancer but hadn’t gotten around to sending it in yet. She will be able to have her own hair made into a wig with your support.8. Juicer to support the fresh juices she will be drinking daily9. Raw and Fresh foods to support her new dietary restrictions10. Everyday expenses like her car payment and insurance, the 2 months remaining on her lease at the apartment and electric bill.11. Gymnastics for the kids – We hate to take them out of that since it’s something they love and thrive with. They are feeling the stress of what is happening and I feel like they need that as an outlet 12.

It is now May of 2017, the last seven months have been a whirlwind of aggressive cancer treatments and various surgeries, there have been several set backs to John's recovery. Some of which included a month and a half stay in the hospital for a post surgical abscess from the lung removal surgery that lead to and air leak in his existing lung to a minor heart attack, and most recently a fractured spine from a fall caused by his brain tumors. John still has quite the road to go before he's in the clear and we have faith that the Lord will bring us our miracle and soon we will be rejoicing in his absolute healing!

Elijah needs a stem cell Transplant and it must be done out in Children's Hospital Colorado. I his mom will be there with him 24/7 which will have costs in its own but unfortunately his dad will have to stay behind to work and keep up with our insurance that we so desperately need and our bills.

As devastating as this news was it was nothing compared to the news we received a week later. Stage IV with another mass found in his liver. Ryan is now in a literal fight for his life. He will begin chemo treatments this week followed by surgery soon after. As if that is not enough to worry about, he also has to worry about supporting his amazing wife, Coryne, and two beautiful children, 2 1/2 year old Preston and 10-month-old Noelle. Ryan’s treatments are going to make him extremely fatigued and weak. He will, therefore, be unable to perform at his job which is very physically demanding. Since he has not been at his new job long enough he will not be paid for time off and is not eligible for FMLA. This is where you come in.

Lucas has stage 4 Signet Ring Gastric cancer that mas metastasized to his peritoneum. This is a form of aggressive cancer in its late stages in his abdomen. While Lucas is grateful to have a strong emotional support system, advanced life saving cancer treatment comes with serious financial concerns and unexpected expenses that the family would like to be prepared for. Our final goal is to raise $65,000 to support Lucas and his family during this difficult time. However, in order to QUICKLY get support to them and reduce their stress and concern in these first weeks we are praying a need of $40,000 can be raised as soon as possible.Any contribution is greatly appreciated! Background: Lucas and his wife Kristen were celebrating a sweet friends wedding this past weekend when he noticed a lump in his abdomen. Both being in the medical field they quickly met with doctors earlier this week to determine the cause. Lucas had been experiencing some troubling symptoms since Fall of 2016, but was reassured that the symptoms were not a sign for concern. Sadly, that was not the case.After being hospitalized, he continued to hear more about his current condition. Current Condition:Lucas is currently hospitalized in San Diego. The team of doctors have informed the family that while their is hope, his condition is severe and will require aggressive treatment in order to save his life.Treatment plan:He remains in the hospital currently. The doctors will place his port today and he will begin chemo. Originally surgery was the first option, however his cancer more advanced than they had hoped and they must first do 3-6 months of chemotherapy, in hopes that it responds well (only 40% of patients respond well to the chemo) and minimize the size of his cancer throughout his abdomen, surgery will then be an option (please join us in praying for that!!). Their current NEED:Lucas is preparing to fight for his life and needs the constant support of his wife Kristen. Their youngest son, Meyer, is just 15 months old and also needs Kristens constant care. For those that know Lucas had just began CRNA school in September and Kristen was to be the only provider during this time.

I received my degree in music composition from UC at Santa Cruz Ca in 1994.  About 3 plus years ago I noticed that it was becoming more and more difficult for me to sing.  I noticed a loss of range and my voice didn't seem to be healing.  I was mis-diagnosed as having a stomach acid reflex issue almost 2 years ago.  For over a year and a half I did diet and Speech therapy hoping to heal the issue with no positive results.  It really depressed me and greatly affected my ability to perform and earn a living.  Just over a month ago I returned to the throat doctor and was diagnosed as having a stage 4 cancerous tumor that has effectively paralyzed my left vocal chord.  The American doctor’s have recommended an intense regiment of toxic chemo and radiation treatments.   If the chemo/radiation doesn't work, then they want to do surgery and remove my voice box.   They have assured me these treatments are rather painful and terrible and the side effects and long term consequences of these treatments likely include loss of hearing, loss of the ability to speak, loss of the ability to produce saliva or swallow, loss of or damage to the ability to father children, highly increased likely hood of developing other cancers due to radiation exposure, loss of ability to eat.........the list goes on and on. They say they have only a 50/50 chance of reducing my tumor using their destructive and toxic methods.   They have also told me that without treatment they do not expect me to survive more than a year.  I however feel that I am focused and strong, and that I am utterly committed to do what it takes to heal and survive.  I have important work to do in this world and I want to be here for my son, my partner and for you.  I don’t want to do chemo/radiation.  I am holding on to another version of the future where I can heal myself without toxic poison.I request that you donate to this funding campaign to send me to one of the most cutting edge alternative cancer healing facilities in the world.  It is located in Tiajuana, Mexico.  I have heard amazing positive reports from people who have healed themselves there.   This program is not cheap.  It costs close to $25,000 just for 3 weeks at the clinic.  I'm hoping 6 weeks will be enough for me to heal.  I believe it that it will heal me and I am actually really excited about going there (especially considering the alternative).  I have been composing and working on an album for close to 10 years.  I will send you this full album as an acknowledgement of anyone who contributes to help me.  I want everyone to know that I am doing everything I can to heal including exercise, meditation, a no sugar, alcohol, tobacco, gluten, animal products diet.  I want to use this as an opportunity to become a better human being and not a reduced one.  Please remember, time is of the essence.  My goal is to begin treatment in Mexico by July 4th 2017.  You play an active role in saving my life and helping me to sing again.  I ask that you share this with everyone possible in order to reach the goal as quickly as possible.  I and my family thank you from the bottom of our hearts.Blane",ed61f850431ac030fa31206a4431b184,40,0.7189833333333333,570.0,2,1,general,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

He threw up and was sent home. This officially began the ultimate hurdle that we still don’t fully understand. We took him to the ER and the initial assessment was an appendix rupture. After an ultrasound and CT Scan, doctors found a lump and rushed Nick into emergency surgery. None of my military experience or training could have prepared me to hear the words come out of the doctor’s mouth, “Your son has cancer.”Five surgeries later, he is still fighting. As a disabled combat veteran (Iraq 2xs) who is retired and on a fixed income, our family needs resources to give Nick the best chance at winning. Our medical insurance doesn’t cover much. I'm asking anyone who is able to donate to help us with his bills as we face this unexpected journey.

Nov 2014 had surgery to install a Bioflo Mediport for Chemotherapy.  First 6 Chemo Treatments went from Dec. 2014 thru March 2015.  I also got laid off from work during this time and had a hard time finding another job while going through Chemo.

Everything looked well in April 2015 and appeared the cancer was gone.


I got another job but then on August 2015 I was once again Stage 4 with Follicular Lymphoma (Cancer).  I once again started a different chemotherapy but this time we did 12 Chemo treatments from Sept 2015 thru Feb 2016.  The company I worked for went out of buisness and again hard to find another job while doing Chemotherapy. I also started another job in Oct 2015.



Once again everything seem to be going well and cancer appeared to be gone.  


In August of 2016 I was once again was faced with being Stage 4 with Follicular Lymphoma (Cancer).  The doctors decided the next procedure was going to be a bone marrow transplant.  We started all the tests and doing donor testing.  My daughter was the closest match and we were going to do the bone marrow transplant in Oct 2016. 
 I had to leave my job to begin the next medical treatment.  Once again we got hit hard cause the transplant was needing to be pushed due to the fact the cancer grew and was too aggressive to proceed.  We did another 6 chemotherapy treatments from Oct 2016 thru Nov 2017 at Georgetown Hospital.

After the chemotherapy treatments the cancer still grew through the treatments so the Bone Marrow Transplant was canceled until further Notice.


At this point I have done all the different chemotherapy treatments available.  Doctors decided to move to experimental trials Dec 2016.

Test showed the trials was not working and they were discontinued.


Now we are waiting to see if we can get into another experimental procedure gene therapy.  Since the cancer has made it to my bone marrow I am doing one sometimes two blood and platelet transfusions a week since end of Dec 2016.  I am at doctors or hospital 3 times a week min.

This is very hard for me to ask for help however this fight with cancer since Aug 2014 has empty my 401k and savings account.  


When I had to leave my job back in Oct 2016 due to medical treatments,  I applied for Disability but it has not been approved yet and say it will take 6 months to a year before they even give me an answer of yes or no.


I am asking for help due to this fight with cancer that has lasted over 2 yrs and all my funds are gone.  Again this is hard for me to ask for help but I have no where left to turn.",44a2057187bdf881220cdb69cd4c7b5c,29,0.86725,690.0,6,1,lymphoma,0,3,0,2,0,0.006024096385542169,0.0,0.005512679162072767,3.2225606657843358,0.0,gofundme

For those of you who know him, you know that he is an extraordinary human being. He is always cheerful, loving, UNBELIEVABLY STRONG and always puts his friends and family before anything else. 

He underwent chemo and various other procedures starting at the end of December 2017 to help try to slow the growth of the cancer (his case is “very aggressive”) , which was successful.  But, with further testing cancerous cells are still being detected throughout his bones and some soft tissue. As a result, he is still having to undergo chemothearapy on a regular basis and we are nearing July of 2018.  

Because of this, he has been unable to work and will not be able to return to work indefinitely.  His retirement unfortunately can only touch the very tip of the iceberg when it come to the expenses that come along with fighting an illness like Cancer.  Many of his medical expenses and medicines are not covered by insurance and with the everyday necessities of life, money is getting tighter and tighter.

To top everything off, both AC units at their home have decided to go out this summer. Mom and dad both have been confined to their bedroom where we have purchased a window unit to help them stay as cool as possible for the time being until we can raise the funds to fix the AC. With the unbearable heat of Arkansas summers their room is still a blistering 87 degrees with the rest of the house in the upper 90’s. It’s no comfortable place to return after treatment to rest and get better. 

Victor is one of the strongest, most selfless people I have ever known and is always there to give his love and support or the shirt off his back to anyone that needs it.  So much so that he would never ask anyone for financial help himself and would still claim that someone else could use the help worse.

Now, it's time that we give back some of that love and support to Vic.  Anything you can donate will be more appreciated than you could ever imagine.  Everything we can do to help surround him with love is what is most important so he can focus on beating this thing.  Please help us to spread the word!!! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!

Praise God!Please keep praying she will regain her strength as she will be going for blood tests midweek this week, and her next treatment on Friday if all checks out.Please continue to pray for peace for our family throughout this journey, and peace for Angela as she faces a lot more appointments and also the possible & inevitable side effects the treatments will bring.Please also continue to pray for provision re the costs involved as we found out this week our insurance company will not cover our travel expenses for treatments which is turning out to be quite substantial.

My brothers and I were raised by Ilona, a single mother for many years, just trying to provide a healthy home for her children. In 2003 we found out my mother had developed stage three breast cancer. We were very young and didn’t quite understand the gravity of the situation. Luckily the wonderful staff and friends at Hospice helped our family through the hardest of years. Ilona remained cancer free for 12 years. In July of 2015, my mom had slipped and fallen down some steps (which our family soon found out would be a blessing in disguise). She began to experience severe back pain, and finally, we were able to convince her to see a doctor for the pain.Multiple tests were performed including an MRI. The test results revealed that not only had she fractured the T12 bone in her spine, she had developed a tumour with several lesions on her bones. It turned out my mom had developed Metastatic Breast Cancer. The cancer that started in her breast years ago, has now spread into her spine.During this past summer my mother began to rapidly lose weight and further tests and MRI scans revealed that there were more lesions appearing on her bones. Currently her state of health is decreasing, resulting in a weight of under 100 pounds and even losing 2 inches in height.The first round of cancer brought on a world of pain for my mother. Radiation and Chemo therapy drew every ounce of strength from her body as it has done to countless others in similar situations. After finding out about the new cancer, she decided to pursue other means of treatment. My mom has been in contact with many research groups and hospitals to try and find a better alternative to conventional cancer treatment methods, but until recently she had no success.After months and months of research and consultations with Doctors at the Garson clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, she has been approved to go and receive the treatment she desires. However, the financial burden would be too great for our family to overcome.The treatment lasts 21 days in total and provides her with 8 different methods of immunotherapy. This is the treatment that she has been looking for, for so long. Giving her the opportunity to go to this facility would bring a great deal of happiness and health not only to her but to my brothers and I. But of course, nothing worth while in this world is free, the treatment comes with a price tag of $28,650 USD (approx. $38,000 CAD).We are reaching out to all of our wonderful friends and family to try and help us raise the funds needed to help her. Please reach into your hearts and help us send Ilona away so that she can return healthy and happy again. Even if you can’t spare any money, please spare a second and share our story in the hopes that others might be able to help. Thank you for taking the time to read this message, and thank you for all the love and support.",d79e7b3e90ef8046e874690ff4f66f82,23,0.9338947368421052,660.0,6,0,breast cancer,0,1,0,1,0,0.0017985611510791368,0.0,0.036044973544973546,1.2225606657843358,0.0,gofundme

That same night I had to call an ambulance so he could go back to the hospital due to a blood clot causing massive swelling and excruciating pain. From there we spent the next 3 days in the hospital and he had a drain tube hanging out of the incision from the first surgery to drain the excess blood.

We currently live in Reno Nevada, and are having to regularly travel to Salt Lake City, Utah for his treatment. Both his mother and I work in the service industry which has no paid time off or benefits, so the travel has caused substantial financial strain on our family, as we both had to take a leave of absence to accommodate his treatment schedule. We are asking for donations to help with travel expenses for his treatment, as well and to help alleviate some of the normal financial stress such as rent and living expenses during our son's time of need. FULL STORY:On April 22, 2017 our 4 month old baby boy was diagnosed with stage 4 Metastatic Neuroblastoma, a rare form of cancer which starts in the adrenal glands and quickly spreads all throughout the body. It started as a small pea sized bump on his abdomen, which the doctors said was no cause for worry. Then very quickly several small bumps appeared strictly on his abdominal area. The doctors had no clue what they could be and he seemed to be happy and healthy, so again they told us there was no need to worry. The bumps continued to multiply and grow in size and we brought him in 3 more times before they finally did a CT scan. Shortly after the doctor rushed into the room with the bad news. He has small tumors all over his body, including his liver, lungs, kidneys, testicles, all over his abdomen and even one over his eye.We left for Utah on April 2nd, 2017 for his first round of treatment and this first trip has already drained most of our savings account. I've never been one to ask for help, but I won't be able to work as I need to be there for my son through these rough treatments. His treatment will last a minimum of 9 months which puts a pretty steep financial burden on our family as we still need to pay bills, eat, and afford all the travel expenses that come along with his treatment. Each trip to Utah costs roughly $1200 and we will need to go twice a month for the next 9 months. We also need to keep up on other expenses during that time. I plan on working whenever I can but the financial stress is already starting to weigh heavily, and this is just the start of our journey.I'm setting our goal for $25,000. That will cover travel costs, living expenses, and out of pocket medical expenses that come with his treatment over the next 9 months. I know that it seems like a large number but I'm going to stay hopeful. Please help however you can, and share this with your friends and family. This takes a lot for me to swallow my pride and ask for help but if that's what I have to do to be there for my little guy, then I'll do it.I'll keep you all updated throughout our journey and if you you have any questions don't hesitate to ask. My family and I are so grateful for all the positive support and help in this time of need.Help spread the word.Thank you",33ad368519c63a53330b5ece34e1397b,21,0.81505,630.0,1,1,neuroblastoma,0,0,2,0,1,0.0,0.003395585738539898,0.7742987606001305,0.0,2.0,gofundme

The pons is responsible for vital functions such as breathing, swallowing, coordination, balance and heart rate. It primarily affects children between 5-11 Years old. Teens and adults can have DIPG although its extremely rare.  DIPG is considered  terminal with only 9-12 months median survival of patients upon diagnosis. Only 10-20 % of DIPG patients survive up to two years.  For more information on DIPG visit  http://dipgregistry.org/patients-families/about-dipg/dipg.org .Our Family: I am TJ Pelagio, a restaurant manager in the Philippines and my wife is Che, a work-at-home mom.  Trinity  was born approximately 3 years after we got married so you could say that having her was long overdue. She is the first grandchild on both sides and very much the big doting sister to all of her four cousins. Trinity likes YouTube videos, video games, Steven Universe, Adventure Time, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Barbie and slime and crafting among other things . It really does not make sense how she got sick because her favorite food consists mainly of healthy food such as fruits, fish, broccoli, and yogurt (she would say she prefers it over ice cream).How it startedThe month of March 2018 started very busy for Trinity with the final exams and the last days of school approaching.  We thought she was just being stressed out when she complained of headaches throughout the day.  Then we noticed she was beginning to tilt her head on to one side when she which we thought as plain old mannerism. But during the course of another week she began vomiting. She vomited almost everyday during the mornings and sometimes after eating in the afternoon.  This prompted us to take her to the clinic where the pediatrician told us to keep her from eating dairy and chocolates due to stress.  Same doctor also sent us to see an eye doctor to test her vision to see if it was causing the headaches.  The ophthalmologist told us there was nothing wrong with her vision so that left us with the dairy abstinence.  After that first trip to the doctors we were optimistic that everything was just part of her puberty acting up. The next few days there was no vomiting but she was still in pain.  Her headache made her didn't want to get out of bed and it was that time that school was over so she was just lying in her room most of the time.  One day she and Che went to her school to pick up her final school cards and then decided to meetup with her classmates at the mall. They went and did what normal kids do at the mall, arcade, frappuccinos, and even ""nerf tag"".  During lunch time after eating a lot of chicken wings, Trinity asked to go to the restroom and then suddenly threw up everything she ate.  Che knew then we needed to take her back to the doctor.  We decided to consult a new pediatrician recommended by Che's sister.  The new doctor noticed she had sinus problems which may contribute to her headache but asked us to do a CT Scan to put our worries to rest.  It was after that test it seems, that our worries escalated to pure horror and shock.  The scan detected a mass in in her brain and we were told to get an MRI to get a more detailed image of the mass.  These terms were very new to my wife and me: MRI, CT Scan, and it was even our first time to ride an ambulance that day as the MRI service was not available in the hospital that we were admitted.    The Diagnosis:Like I said, everything was very new to us and all these medical stuff were being shoved to our brains very fast.  I do not know how MRI scans go but after taking Trinity through a stretcher inside a noisy machine for 1 hour, we got handed the big envelope where the negative prints were and a piece of paper which contains what looks like an initial analysis of the image that was taken of my daughters brain.  I saw my wife’s hand weaken as she read the paper, almost dropping it in the process.  I took it from her and read it and saw the words tumor and “blastoma” which I would come to know later as synonymous with cancer.  After the scan we found out that pediatric neurologists were very few in this country and we would likely see the one who could read the scans to us within the next 48 hours. Our kind doctor recommended that if we wished, we can move her to another hospital if we knew another pedia neurologist who can take our case.  Luckily, Che has good friends in the medical field and they have helped us get transferred to a better hospital and coordinated for us to get our diagnosis sooner.  Nothing could have prepared us the for the worst news of our lives.  We got to be introduced to four dreaded letters:D.I.P.G. It is a rare form of brain tumor that is inoperable and incurable.  I can remember holding back my tears as I listened to the doctor explain to us all these medical terms some of which I really did not bother to listen.  As soon as the words “9-12 months to live” was mentioned my mind just involuntarily shut itself and dread and shock came over.  I remember my wife was blankly staring into the doctors eyes.  She was repeating her words and struggling to form new sentences to say.We were advised that the prescribed treatment  is 30 sessions of Radio Therapy which blasts the tumor with concentrated X-rays with the purpose of attempting to shrink the tumor down to size but never actually taking it out.  We were told that after the therapy Trinity may experience alleviated symptoms for a couple of months.  Che asked what I was thinking: ""what happens after that?” to which the Doctor replied  ""then we may expect her symptoms to gradually worsen afterwards"". I can hear my heart broke into thousand pieces.

Our Plan:It has been almost two months since that fateful day at the hospital and we are already on last week of Trinity's Radio Treatment sessions.  I have spent that time researching learning more on this disease and what other options do we have.  I have learned that in the US and Australia,  children with DIPG have undergone clinical trials which means that while it has no cure yet,  kids together with their parents are fighting to find it.A little over a year ago Che and I were working and saving up to migrate to Australia.   I qualified for a skilled migration program and all the money we earned the past year up to now has been put into this endeavor of ours.  Now that we are days away from getting our visa approved, our plan is to go to Australia and look for more options for Trinity's treatment.  We have only saved enough to support us for a few months until we get settled in this new country and with my daughter's condition it is certain that our medical expenses will accumulate really fast.  So we want to be prepared.  More over, Trinity will begin to have special needs when her symptoms come back and we would like for her to be as comfortable as possible and again come prepared.How you can helpMy wife and I are asking everyone who reads this to help us extend our daughter's life. Help us bring her to Australia to look for more treatment and at the same time make more experiences with her in this new country.  She is the only one we have and she has been the motivation for every single thing we have done in our lives. She is so excited to come to Australia and she is even planning everything she is going to do there even how her room is going to look like.  She has a heart of gold and a soft spot for all animals which makes her a perfect fit to live there.  Help us make her wishes come true.  With your donations, our family can hit two birds in one stone:1. Look for clinical trials in Australia which may and can extend her life, and 2. fulfill Trinity’s bucket list and experience more of the country making her life full of memories and moments with us.  We hope that this fund raising campaign  will be successful so that we can spend more quality time with Trinity without the stress of worrying about the finances.  No amount is too small.  Your kindness and generosity will surely get us through this trying time in more ways you can ever imagine. We thank you for the time you took to read this and we hope that God rewards your kindness.  Please click the share button.",e48eb2601b2547edd3cb06a49fab0f0d,68,0.2739333333333333,240.0,4,0,general,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

And hearing that diagnosis at a young age, an age when you feel as if you are in the prime of your life, is a deafening sound reverberating throughout your whole being. This story is of a young woman's journey through a life experience that is an extradinary battle, with a foe that no one wants to engage, but one that with strength, love, and perserverance can be beat. My beautiful daughter, Sarah, was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 29. At the time of her diagnosis, she was in the middle of aquiring a Master's degree at the University of Wyoming in the field of Experimental Psychology and working toward her Doctorate in the same field. Her somewhat neurotic mindset was a blessing in disguise, as to noticing a slight abnormality on the skin of her breast, something probably unnoticable to most, caused her concern and to seek out medical consultation. Breast Cancer was the diagnosis, and quickly a devastating and confusing world was thrust upon her. A world traditionally reserved for those of her mother's age and beyond, not that of a young 29 year old woman. Alarmingly throughout this journey, she was to discover how common younger and younger woman were being diagnosed with this disease and the need for her age group to be more informed. The long process of chemotherapy, loss of hair, impaired body image, pain usually associated with much older people, fatigue, and financial burden was overwhelming.  But through all this immense struggle, my daughter, maintained high grades in her academic endeavor, became a published first author in a highly accredited academic journal, published as co-author in other journal publications, and graduated with a PHD in Experimental Psychology. She continued to live and love, and with that unbreakable smile beat the cancer that threatened her life.  Unfortunately, we all know that Cancer is a disease that does not always stay down when beaten. Sarah is now 33 years old, and again is fighting the battle of her life. She has just been diagnosed with Stage 4 Cancer,  since some has spread to her bone. She's not giving up the fight, and is ready to take it on again, but financially she is suffering greatly, still paying for the first round with this unrelentless foe.  She will continue to fight with the strength, humor, and tenacity that is in every fiber of her being. She's not one to ask for help, but as her mother, who is so very proud of her accomplishments, her strength, and her love of life and others, would ask for that help for her. Anything to help ease some of the burden of the fight that she is now facing. Please ""like"" and share Sarah's story.  We appreciate your prayers and words of encourgement. God Bless you.",9793082be33a9d83cbddbe86692e75a3,22,4.855,600.0,2,1,breast cancer,1,9,2,5,1,0.018329938900203666,0.004073319755600814,0.10257326661901359,15.697308646192194,2.0,gofundme

Lee was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer with liver metastasis in September 2017.  He began chemotherapy treatment in November of that year, after recovering from two emergency surgeries (one to remove part of his colon and another to place a stent in his artery to alleviate edema to his legs) and a paracentesis, a procedure that drained excess fluids in his abdomen caused by his diseased liver.  John responded well to the chemo treatments and was able to return to work in March 2018.  He would continue to receive chemo every other week to keep the cancer in check.  In December 2018, John received frightening news that the different treatments that he has been taking are no longer effective in controlling the cancer.  He was given Mitomycin-C by his oncologist as a third-line treatment on January 2nd, 2019.  A week later, his belly had grown so big that he had to go to the hospital to have a paracentesis procedure to remove the ascites built up in his abdomen.  The hospital staff removed 5.5 Liters of fluid from his body.  He went home the next day but developed a fever the day after.  He went back to the hospital on January 11th 2019 and has not returned home since.    Over the next few days, his appetite decreased drastically and the severity of pain he felt increased.  He is normally a person with high pain tolerance and his facial expressions indicated he was suffering.  When he could no longer tolerate the pain, he asked for hydromorphone.  While the medication relieved some of his pain, it also gave him many side effects, including drowsiness, nausea, headaches, and difficulty in using the bathroom.  A second paracentesis was performed on him and this time over 7 Liters of fluid was drained from him.  A Tenckhoff catherer was put into his abdominal area so that future drainage could be done at his bedside.  Three bedside drainage have been done so far, draining 300ml, 600ml, and 975ml respectively, with future drainage to be done every other day.   John's health continued to worsen during his stay at the hospital.  Then on January 16th, two weeks after his latest chemo treatment, doctors from the hospital and the cancer treatment center had a meeting with John and his family to discuss his condition and treatment options he should consider.  He was told that due to the aggressiveness of his cancer, his prognosis was very bad and he has at most 6 months to live.  He had two options: A) stop cancer treatment and focus on hospice care that would manage his symptoms and provide comfort for the remainder of his life or B) go to rehab,  attempt to overcome the symptoms caused by the cancer, regain his strength, and maybe try Mitomycin again or Oxaliplantin that gave him a bad reaction before.  The chances of succeeding are very very slim to none and the possible risks and side effects could outweigh the benefits.  John, being the fighter that he is, chose to go to a rehabilitation center to continue his battle with cancer.  Myself, my two other siblings, and his wife are fully supportive of his decision, and will stay by his side day and night to provide care for him in this fight for his life.John Lee is a very altruistic person and he loves to help people any way he can.  After college, he worked as a social worker for some time for the Chinese American Planning Council and provided services to new immigrants to overcome language barriers they faced in their adopted country.  After becoming a father of two special needs children, he left a good paying corporate job and went back to school to become a Speech Language Pathologist to help his own children as well as others in the special needs community.   He is an advocate for kids with special needs and often tries to educate the public about Autism Spectrum Disorder.  At church, he was involved in ESL teachers training and special needs children Sunday School.  He became very involved in his cancer support community by serving in its Participant Advisory Council and helping with fundraising efforts.  He has a big heart, a generous personality, and has made a difference in the lives of many people.  He is filled with love, hope, faith, and strength.  Read More About John Here John and his family really need your help.  John's wife Sharon is taking an unpaid leave from work to care for John and their kids.  They currently don't have any income.  The money raised from this campaign will help with their living expenses, existing and future medical bills, other future costs as a result of this disease, and funding for special needs trusts set up for their children.  Please contribute if you can.  No amount is too small.  Thank you very much.(Photo taken August 27, 2017 -

They are apart of the Lineman Brotherhood family. The main goal here is to raise awareness about this rare cancer and help raise money for  medical expenses during Stetson's journey. Any leftover contributions will be strictly donated to research for MRT, or to another family suffering from MRT. Stetson Garwood was born on June 6th, 2017. At just 19 months old, Stetson was diagnosed with a malignant  rhabdoid tumor. This aggressive tumor is found mostly in young children. Only 20-25 cases are reported each year. There is a one in three survival rate (33%).  This tumor attacks soft tissue in the body mostly found in the kidneys, liver, brain and lungs.  Stetson is currently stage 3. The tumor was on his left kidney and has since been removed along with surrounding lymph nodes.  Stetson is starting his 8 month journey of chemo. He will receive 8 cycles of chemo that will insert six new chemicals into his body. In between his first and second cycle of chemo, Stetson will undergo eleven days of radiation. The radiation will be introduced to the site where the tumor was found. He must have radiation between his first and second cycle because the chemicals that will be introduced during the second cycle can have a dangerous reaction with radiation. Due to the chemo and radiation, he will most likely need a blood transfusion after every other cycle of chemo. He may need more depending on his white blood cell count. Stetson will have internal scarring and also lose inches of his height due to the kidney radiation being close his spine. Stetson will also be put under for a CT scan and and MRI after each cycle of chemo to ensure no other tumors have formed . Even if Stetson has a cancer free screening in 8 months, there's still a 90% chance it will return.The Garwood family is from Bargersville, Indiana. Garrett, 28, has been a lineman since 2014. He has been a journeyman since March of 2018. Garrett has worked for Duke Energy, ARC, Service Electric and is currently working for Hydaker Wheatlake.  Ashley, 25, is in the medical field and grew up in Plainfield, IN. During such a difficult time, The Garwood's are also expecting their second boy. Beau Gannon Garwood due date is July 28th, 2019. This cancer may be hereditary. The Garwood's are waiting for genetic testing to see if their unborn baby tests positive. If the tests come back positive, there's a 50/50 chance the baby will go through similar hardships as Stetson. Stetson is so adventurous and loves to run around and play. He also loves paw patrol! As Ryder says on the show, ""No job is too big, no pup is too small!"" We believe with the love and support of the Lineman brotherhood and others, we can raise enough money for Stetson's medical expenses. All leftover contributions will be strictly donated to research for MRT or another family suffering from MRT. Please consider a donation of any amount to our dear friend Garrett and his family during this difficult time. The Garwood's  want to thank everyone for the prayers and support in their time of need. They want everyone to know that their main goal is to raise awareness and find a cure that way NO child or family will have to suffer from MRT. Please Share this on Facebook.

In early 2017 Sean was diagnosed with liposarcoma, a rare type of cancer that affects the body's connective tissues. He required 10 hours of surgery to remove a massive tumour from his abdomen. The radiation took a toll on Sean and the fight was difficult, but he battled back and pulled through. Recovery was a long, tough road, but thankfully, in March 2018, a follow up scan gave us much relief when the results came back clear. Sadly just months after this clear scan, in October 2018, we were thrown back into the ring to ‘fight’ again. We learned that the cancer had come back, this time packing an even stronger and more aggressive punch. Sean is now undergoing multiple chemotherapy treatments in order to stop the disease from spreading. While the outlook remains grim, we continue to fight for the sake of our family and truly thank everyone for sending us your thoughts & prayers. The challenge ahead2019 will be a particularly difficult year us and we’re hoping you can help offset some of the intense financial pressures experienced by Sean and our family.  The medications required and the cost of the treatments are extremely expensive and Sean's private insurance is already maxed out. One of his medications is $1200 per dose alone! As Sean is currently too weak and unable to work, Amy is solely supporting the family. We are asking you to help alleviate some of the treatment and medication costs, and any unexpected costs that the family will incur.Anything you can donate will be greatly appreciated. We want Sean and his family to remain hopeful and focused on him healing and beating cancer.This fund has been organized by The Martellacci Family (Sean's In-Laws) who live close to Sean in Woodbridge ON.  The funds being raised will be used to cover many expenses related to Sean's illness including medicine, travel, as well as day to day living expenses due to Sean's reduced income level.",afb2e3822e4a98c8acaa04f7594303fd,16,0.3041333333333333,3.0,2,0,general,0,6,0,3,0,0.01680672268907563,0.0,0.004413928396272682,10.487587383884751,0.0,gofundme

Gina is fiercely independent and has always put her rescue before herself time and time again. This time will be no different even though she tries to assure us she will put herself first. For anyone that knows Gina, knows this is impossible and the reason we love her so damn much as well as wanting to tear our hair out.We know Gina needs support now more than ever. Gina had a huge health scare just over two years ago. She battled it quietly and didn't want to draw attention to her battle. Still rescuing and thinking of the dogs that needed her as she sat in hospital recovering.This time will be no different except for this. Gina has gone without time and time again because she puts her all into her beloved rescue and the dogs. She has gone without food or her own medication at times because she always puts animals and other people first. Gina has sold almost everything she owns just so that animals are given a chance where others would just discard them. Gina is always the first to help others in crisis and we feel it is most definitely the time that we all pitch in to help Gina at the time she needs it the most.Gina doesn't do it for the attention or for praise. It us just who Gina is intrinsically. No one can fake the dedication she has. It is part of her soul. This new battle ahead will see her do the same. It is who Gina is and she cannot be stopped! Her closest friends know she says she will try to concentrate on herself first but we know Gina too well. Even as Gina comes to terms with what lays ahead, instead of sitting still she is filling in time working on helping the old neglected dogs. Gina doesn't want a fuss or attention but I feel like we can't let Gina hide and say she is fine while she struggles. Whether we raise a dollar or $1000 this money is for Gina and/or her family to use as they see fit. For medications, for specialist appointments, for petrol to get to appointments, for an air conditioner, for a bill or two, just anything at all. Just something to take away some financial stress that this cancer journey is going to bring with it. This is for Gina, this is not rescue, this is not for anyone but Gina and/or her family. We believe in Gina's ability to beat cancer but nobody can deny that the ride is going to be very tough at times. We just want to make it a little easier and a lot more comfortable where we can.Her dear friend Tony sent Gina this song to her yesterday. The people who have struggled through this journey themselves talk of not having to do it alone and how they needed support. I ask you to watch it. It is going to take a lot to get through this and Gina deserves to not have to fight this alone, quietly or dismiss her own health because she doesn't want to create a fuss. https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=PLJK99w6I2oIGC20kT2BiwRXvGd8m73ReU&v=ZYNOXRifXKQMartina McBride - I'm Gonna Love You Through ItBest of martinamcbride:  https://goo.gl/VmN7Gw Subscribe here:  https://goo.gl/mRaS2v Music video by Martina McBride performing I'm Gonna Love You Through It. ...youtube.com",65aa962182b1b91022229ab23d9bbf14,30,0.808,0.875,4,0,general,0,5,2,4,1,0.008417508417508417,0.003367003367003367,0.15781049935979513,8.863710257429574,2.0,gofundme

It’s a rare brain tumor, uncommon in young females especially. Mariam only 16 at the time, came home from a school dance just over a year ago on Oct. 15 and woke up the next morning in a seizure. She was immediately rushed to the hospital to find out that she had stage 3/4 brain cancer. She’s   a normal, healthy teenager who loves spending time with friends, family and loves to go shopping. She never had a symptom prior to her diagnosis. Mariam went this last year through bouts of chemo and radiation always in good spirits and optimistic. Just as we were planning a big birthday for her in August, and even feeling weak she was so excited for her birthday. Than Unexpectedly, she had a seizure that same weekend and never got to enjoy what might be her last birthday. Mariam ended up having to go into surgery in order to have a shunt placed in her skull to help relieve the pressure from the tumor. She came out of it her happy self always smiling and laughing with her soft respectful voice. She continued to tell her family and friends not to worry once she’s better she’ll visit everyone. Always so strong and optimistic. Unfortunately, around October of this last year she got an infection in her shunt, which could be fatal itself. Since then, slowly she’s been through a really tough time. Mariams no longer mobile and takes full time attention from her parents and 3 other siblings.

Dawn Marie, a supportive wife and working mother of three boys, was diagnosed with aggressive Stage 2 breast cancer two weeks before Christmas. The shock was overwhelming and to say ""I have cancer"" is crazy Dawn told me. We spoke at length about being strong, staying positive and how she would do what was needed for her to be cancer free.  Dawn will be undergoing a double mastectomy on January 8th, 2019.  It is unknown at this time if Dawn will need to undergo chemotherapy and/or radiation for further treatment. She will not find out until after her January 8th surgery. With that said, Dawn's only worry should be having the strength to fight this long battle towards recovery and survival.  But unfortunately, the reality is the  majority of us are not prepared to take many months off from work without notice. Dawn Marie will be unable to work for an undetermined amount of time and this will put a financial burden on a family already under a lot of stress. While we cannot take away the worry of cancer, at least we can all help to ease the financial stress.  life is not easy and we all have our own daily struggles, but cancer is a life changing event. Dawn has no choice but to rest, even if she doesn't want to.  She has no choice but to heal and follow all recommended medical treatments that come her way.

After an CT Scan, they learned she had a brain tumor that required immediate surgery. She was brought by ambulance to Fargo, ND where she had surgery. There they learned that Emily had a medulla blastoma (brain cancer). This new knowledge eventually lead Emily and Nate to Illinois. There they were closer to her family and a great team of doctors in Chicago. After a series of chemo and radiation Emily went into a monitoring phase for the next five years. During that time, they moved to North Dakota and were blessed with a baby girl. After a few years, they moved back to Illinois and found out they were pregnant again. Towards the end of Emily's second pregnancy (in 2016) they found out she had a new tumor growing. After surgery to remove the tumor, it was determined that she had a secondary cancer. This time she was diagnosed with osteosarcoma (bone cancer). Chemotherapy followed the surgery that removed the tumor. Since that tumor removal in 2016, Emily has had new growths, a surgery, and ongoing treatments. Her most recent surgery was in the spring of 2018. Since then, a new growth had started and her doctors recommended Chemotherapy before anymore surgery. Emily is currently going through these treatments. Emily is a light for Jesus and knows that no matter what she is going through that #Godisstronger. All funds raised through this campaign will go directly to Emily and her family to help offset medical costs and pay for travel expenses to and from treatments.

We were happy as a family.  But those times didn’t last long because in 2016 my breast cancer Metastisized to my bones.  It fractured two vertebrae in my neck and there were spots down my spine and on my ribs.  This was devastating news because my cancer now became a Stage 4 (terminal) cancer.  However, I have too much to live for to allow this cancer to get to me.  I have had multiple radiation treatments to several areas of my body and have been going through chemo treatments weekly since my new diagnosis.  These treatments will continue for the rest of my life and are very expensive.  Already this year I have a new medical bill for several thousand dollars.  Life has changed for my family again and I just want my girls and my husband to be happy and not have to worry about money.  My husband has a great job and works very hard but as a result, we are not eligible for any financial assistance.  My family has been through so much and they support me daily. I just need to know that they are going to be ok down the road. How can I know that if I can’t ensure that now? I worry all day about money and often I am up through the night wondering how we are going to pay the bills. I should be focusing on fighting this cancer so I can continue to be here for my family.  That is much harder to do when I find myself always thinking about money and worrying... As it is, this year, expenses have increased but our income has decreased slightly due to the need for additional health insurance for me.  The constant worry is really starting to get to me.  So far, we have to be able to give our children the life that they deserve to have and I don’t want them to feel the daily worry that I have or have to sacrifice more than they already have had to do, on so many levels.  Please understand that I am grateful for everything I have and for everyone in my life and nothing will ever change that!!All along we have been doing everything we could do to keep up with the all the medical bills, personal bills and expenses and provide for our girls but the bills and expenses are becoming too much. I have always been one not to ask for help but when talking to a friend the other day, she said, “Michele, it can’t hurt to ask for help. You will never know if you don’t ask and you don’t need the added financial stress!” I thought about it and she is right. The constant worry and wonder is starting to get to me and the one thing that I do know is that this kind of stress can cause my cancer to have more power. I can’t allow that....All I want is to wake up one day without needing to figure out where the money is going to come from when my daughter asks me to get her something at the grocery store or when the request comes from school for the need to buy a ticket for a field trip.  I want to enjoy life, not take the motions to go through life.  That is what I do now and life (especially mine) is way too short for that.  The amount of worry is too great and I honestly don’t know how to fix things without asking for help.  So, Please, if it won’t hurt you to help my family, we would appreciate anything that you might be able to do to help us.  Even if it is just a $1.00 that you can spare or maybe you would be willing to share my link with your friends and family on social media, All of the above would help.  The more eyes that see my post the more of a chance I have to get back on my feet.

She underwent countless tests,ultrasounds, a nuclear bone scan, head x-ray, CT scans and  an MRI. Afinal PET scan and biopsy confirmed her diagnosis: Stage 4 Metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her bones.There is no cure.She plans to treat and fight this disease and hopefully slow itsprogression.  As she says, she will have “an expiration date sooner than planned”, and has lots she wants to accomplish in the meantime.First, and foremost, she would like to take her two sons (14 and 18years old) on a real vacation.  They have never flown in a plane or been west of Pennsylvania.  She wants this time to make lasting memorieswith them.Secondly, her house still needs some work and her car needs repairs.  She has a 2 hour commute to work each day, and her frequent trips to the oncologist are another hour away from her home. And, although she has insurance, her bills for all of the tests haverequired up front payments that she had not anticipated.Anyone who knows Cristina, knows she hates asking for any kindof help.  That's why I'm reaching out to you.  If you can help in any way, please do.  Let's make sure she knows she has a huge loving teambehind her.  Thank you.",aaa360ee181b07f4e07cc4a3f0bbd23b,18,0.4065,2.0,2,1,breast cancer,0,1,0,1,0,0.0027100271002710027,0.0,0.5556083650190115,1.0,0.0,gofundme

When the company was bought by another steel company, they told my father (who was just years away from retirement) that his retirement pension was no longer guaranteed & that he had to continue to work. He was a mill-wright. He was also the only one at the time who knew how to do his job. After working him to the bones, & missing out on most of his children's lives working swing shifts, he felt extremely betrayed by a company he gave his all to.  All my father ever wanted to do was support his family & provide. He still tells me every day not to work too much or too hard. Since then my father has spent as much time as possible with his family, despite foreclosing on his home, losing everything he had worked for, & starting over when he should have simply been enjoying his retirement. Just weeks ago, at age 62,  my father began not feeling well. It began with cirrhosis. He went to the ER, to find a problem much larger than cirrhosis. He currently has stage 4 metastatic cancer (Spine, Ribs, Lungs, Liver, Pancreas, Brain, Bones). It is a strong possibility that asbestos may have been the cause. While working the steel mill all those years, he was consistently exposed to asbestos.  All we know currently, is that the type of cancer he has is not genetic- we are waiting for final tests & confirmation of origin & cause.  Today he was given 6 months to a year, without treatment. My father's occupation took him away from his family while he was young, & is likely going to be taking him away from his family as an elder.My family needs help affording treatment & hospital bills that are not covered by insurance.

She’s hardworking, smart, independent, beautiful, strong and self-sufficient. When she was 18, she began working an entry level position with Publix. After 12 years of hard work and several promotions into management, she decided to pursue a career in Nursing and was accepted to Broward College. In order to dedicate her time to her studies, she transitioned to a part-time position and is no longer covered under the Publix health insurance policy. Instead of being uninsured, Lori is currently paying the high cost of a self-insured COBRA plan in addition to her education and living expenses. In addition to the cost of numerous tests, chemotherapy, radiation, and several surgeries, Lori will also need to undergo an expensive fertility treatment in order to preserve her future plans of being a mother. Because of the nature of these treatments, Lori will not be able to work and has had to take a leave from school. While Lori is the kind of person who would never ask for help, we have decided to ask for her.

A few weeks before Christmas, my cousin and his family received the scary news that their second son is suffering from Hepatoblastoma.  Hepatoblastoma is a very rare form of childhood cancer that starts in the liver. Only one in 1 million children worldwide is affected by this form of cancer per year. Kenjie is my nephew who is almost the same age as my son. I could not imagine how shattering it must be for my cousin and his wife to find out one day that their child has cancer. This is why I thought of raising funds for Kenjie’s medical costs (surgery, hospital bills, medications, chemotherapy) as a way to help and prolong this little one’s life. This baby boy is very clever; he can already read the alphabet, knows the shapes, and identify numbers at such a young age. A sweet bub to all and is always happy, I do believe that he deserves to be treated. He deserves to live. According to my cousin, Kenjie had no symptoms aside from the unusual size of his abdomen and a lump that can be felt along his diaphragm. One night, Kenjie was very fussy and crying; he seemed to be in so much pain, which left his parents uneasy and decided to see a doctor a few days after. Blood tests and scans resulted to a solid mass in this baby’s liver and due to geographical conditions, the only way they can see a paediatric liver specialist is to travel to Manila.My cousin and his family live in a far-flung town called Sta.Ana, Cagayan Valley in the Philippines. To access proper treatment for Kenjie’s condition, his family has to be displaced and travel 16-hours by bus to Philippine General Hospital. The father was an Overseas-Filipino worker who decided to stay in the country since last year to be part of his children’s childhood. He and his wife have online-selling business of all sorts, accepts sushi orders occasionally, and have a small street food stand in the province.Kenjie’s treatment involves admission to the hospital, liver surgery, chemotherapy, infusions, and medications. He is currently neutropenic which means he is very vulnerable to all kinds of infection. The solid mass in his liver has to be removed and the surgery alone costs hundreds and thousands of Philippine peso and is the main concern at the moment. With a fragmented healthcare system that is very hard to access and navigate, my cousins family’s only chance of getting their son operated is through your kind financial donation. Unfortunately for us, there is no universal insurance in our country and out-of-pocket transaction is the only way you can get medical treatment. I believe in the power of kindness. Please help us share this and raise funds for baby Kenjie’s survival.",4cc9938a8ffb442ccadd0bb5e8420928,22,0.1053125,2.0,3,0,liver cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

He is a pastor, devoted husband, father, and grandfather, and community activist (please watch the video for more details of his service to the community).  While helping thousands, Deron has been fighting for his life. Here's the story of his battle...How It All StartedIn 2008, Deron suffered from an aortic aneurysm that almost took his life.  He had a miraculous recovery and returned to full function with routine follow-up CT scans to make sure his surgically repaired aneurysm had remained stable.  On one of these scans in 2015, an incidental finding was made.  He had a concerning spot in one of his lungs that ultimately was diagnosed as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  NSCLC is one of the few types of lung cancer that is not caused by smoking (see here for more information  https://www.cancer.org/cancer/non-small-cell-lung-cancer/about.html).  The great news: the diagnosis was made really early, even before he developed any symptoms.  After undergoing more testing, it was determined to be Stage I (still only in his lungs with no spread to any other places in his body).  A successful treatment plan was developed, and the cancer was now in remission.From Stage I to Stage IVTwo years after going into remission, Deron received some bad news.  On routine follow-up radiographic imaging studies, Deron was found to have a concerning spot in his lung that had grown since his prior study but was too small to biopsy.  He was advised to wait 3-4 months and have another study to monitor the spot on his lung. However, before that time came, he developed what he thought were migraine headaches.  He was seen by a neurologist and extensively tested but the headaches continued to get worse.  On 7/26/17 while preparing to do the 10th anniversary of his ""She's Fabulously 40 & Over"" production, at the advice of a fellow pastor, he went to see his ophthalmologist.  The ophthalmologist referred him to a neuro-ophthalmologist and he worked all day to get an appointment with one of the top neuro-ophthalmologists in the country the next day. The doctor took one look into his eyes (considered the window to what is going on in the brain) and advised him to go back to the Emergency Department to have more testing done, including a spinal tap (a test where fluid is taken from your spinal canal to check for different diseases).On 7/31/2017, the day before his 51st birthday, Deron received preliminary results of the spinal tap. His lung cancer was now metastatic because it had spread from the lungs to another organ or body part.  In his case, the cancer had spread to the spinal fluid and the cells along the lining of his brain and changed his classification from Stage I cancer to Stage IV.  At this point, he was told he could only have a year to live (or less).  The silver lining in all this pre-birthday news was the fact that through genetic testing done during his original cancer diagnosis evaluation, he was known to have an EGFR mutation, a feature of the cancer found in less than 15% of patients with NSCLC. This made him an excellent candidate for a targeted therapy called Tarceva (see more information about Tarceva here:  http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/Tarceva.aspx).  Even better was the fact that he'd already gone through a lengthy approval process to get his insurance company to pay for the medicine when his EGFR mutation was detected.  He was able to start taking Tarceva immediately and was discharged on 8/4/17. He was in the next phase of his journey to beat cancer.  Although he was severely fatigued and still suffering from severe headaches, this dedicated SOLDIER managed to preach the 8:00 AM service on 8/6/2017!!Time for a New MedicationFor a time, things went seemingly well on Tarceva.  Within 6 weeks, he was already starting to show signs of improvement on his imaging studies.  While Tarceva initially slowed the progression of his disease (i.e., kept his lung tumor from getting bigger and his brain disease from worsening), he developed debilitating side effects and his radiographic improvement began to become questionable at best.  His medical team then began the process to get his insurance company to approve coverage of Tagrisso, a medicine approved for cancer treatment by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2017 then upgraded to the 1st line treatment for EGFR-mutated NSCLC in April 2018 ( https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2018/us-fda-approves-tagrisso-as-1st-line-treatment-for-EGFR-mutated-non-small-cell-lung-cancer.html).  It was approved but came with a $15,000.00 per month copay for a 30-day supply.  He, like most of you reading this, was of course unable to afford this and applied for a patient assistance program to help pay for it.  After initially being denied and having to show excessive medical debt during a lengthy appeal process, Deron found out on 5/8/18 that he was approved for the program.  By the grace of God, he could now start the life-saving treatment!  Almost immediately, his clinical status improved.  His strength returned such that he no longer needed assistance walking to and from the pulpit to preach.  What's more, he began to show what was thought to be radiographic improvement on an MRI done just prior to starting Tagrisso.  On 8/8/18, he went for routine follow-up imaging.  This time, his doctors did a CT scan with contrast which revealed a slight increase in his cancer activity which they couldn't say with certainty wasn't there 3 months prior.  Since it was a different type of test it was like comparing apples to oranges. Despite how well he still looked clinically, due to the aggressive nature of Stage IV NSCLC, his doctors recommended increasing the dose of Tagrisso to combat any possible progression of the disease.  How Can You Help?The last 3 years have been an emotionally and financially taxing experience.  God's Love has been expressed through many acts of kindness and has carried Deron and his family through.  Deron must undergo extensive and expensive medical testing every 3 months and at any point could be denied assistance paying the $15,000 monthly copay. He needs help raising enough to pay off his current medical bills and cover the copay for at least one month. Having to seek financial support in this way, and vulnerably share this process in such a public fashion is a truly humbling experience. We are standing in faith believing that there are people Deron has blessed across the nation and globe over the last 25+ years of ministry who are willing to provide a financial blessing during this time of great need. Whether you can give $10, $10,000 or more toward the goal of being able to support the mounting medical expenses and complex medical treatments he is undergoing, no amount is too small!  In addition to making a voluntary donation, we also need your prayers for another display of God's healing power for Deron.  If Deron, or this story, has touched your heart in any way, please donate any amount you can, and we'll pray that God blesses you for your generosity.  We'll let you know how things go with his next round of tests and our search for other programs to assist cancer patients.  If you happen to know of any resources we should try, please include that in your comments.  Thanks, in advance, for your support!",1b195c9aaa8763ba53a0177b2b464b92,55,1.1567,150.0,6,1,lung cancer,1,3,1,3,1,0.002186588921282799,0.0007288629737609329,0.08392237501606477,4.361984648835182,1.0,gofundme

Finished my 6 rounds of chemo on December 18th and will undergo a bilateral mastectomy to remove the original factory models on January 29th, 2019I've felt since first suspecting breast cancer that I was meant to go through this experience. Chemo challenged me but I refused to give up on the cabaret show I created and the work planned so I continued to perform throughout treatment. Had a head shaving party, bought some wig glue and made it happen. It was difficult but I learned my first lesson from cancer; I'm a wee bit tougher than I give myself credit for. Lesson number two; Yes, it is possible to talk myself away from worshiping the porcelain god, get on a plane and seven hours later have a killer show with my cast and a packed house. (*cough* Club Cumming, and thank you) Cancer and chemo gave me the chance to listen to my body differently and I cleared hurtles I'm still surprised by. However, I've become fully aware of the toll chemo has taken on my body and its all catching up with me. I've struggled with neuropathy in my hands and feet, vocal issues, muscle fatigue and cognitive impairment that I managed to power through. In some cases I found ways to grow from a side effect or body pain through dance and vocalizing or other creative outlets but I have officially hit the self help wall and insurance doesn't cover everything. Now comes the hardest part...no, not surgery. Well, yes, surgery but also asking for help. ( Yet another lesson courtesy of Camilla.) Donations will help me cover expenses and in home care while out of work postop, (The next 4 to 6 weeks) continued lymphatic drainage, acupuncture to help with neuropathy and muscle spasms, physical, vocal and other therapeutic treatments. Luckily, the remaining 10 Hert2 antibody treatments are not as difficult to get through, but I refuse to move backwards during my recovery. This is where the real work happens for me. Coming back from the mental and physical impact of it all. Thank you to all who've sent words of reinforcement and messages of love. It helps push me.

In between has been an emotional and traumatic rollercoaster for he, his wife Edith and their precious girls Laia & Kyla. Given the complex and mysterious nature of this particular cancer and because of an initial dire prognosis of “1-2 years” survival, Tom and Edith spread a wide net in search of treatments and therapies that could possibly improve those odds. Fortunately, they eventually found Dr. Holbrook and his team at Deaconess Hospital in Spokane, Washington. On November 26th the doctor performed the 8 hour surgery, and though the pathology report indicated that Tom had a particularly aggressive from of appendix cancer, the doctor is optimistic that in combination with chemo Tom’s chances are good that he’d have many years ahead of him to spend with his loving family. The slow process of recovery has been challenging – 22 days intensive recovery in the hospital, followed by the current day-to-day incremental progress to gain the strength and energy to resume a normal life – has made Tom understand why he is called a ‘patient!’. At the outset Tom & Edith decided to not let cost dictate their path and chose instead to seek whatever showed promise in treating this strange disease, no matter the cost. Bills have mounted (which included medical, alternative therapies, supplements, time off of work, etc), but the focus on exploring the right path for Tom has been worth it, as while they are deeply in debt they take great comfort in their prospects for a healthy future that they gained through Dr. Holbrook.

Christmas celebrations were short as our family moved through tests, scans and appointments to better understand the road ahead. Right before new year we learned Travis is battling Stage 4B Lymphoma that has spread to his spleen, liver, lungs, and bones. In the face of this serious diagnosis, he responded with courage and strength. Based on the extensiveness of the cancer- undergoing an intensive 12 month chemotherapy regimen will best set him up for winning this battle and continuing life with his beautiful family. Due to the intensity of his treatment - Travis will be unable to work for the foreseeable future as his immune system will be weakened and he will be unable to leave the home aside for treatment. As the primary provider for his family this has been incredibly hard to accept and since it’s not like Travis to ask for assistance, we are taking it upon ourselves to Rally in his fight to Tackle Cancer.

Yo la conozco. He visto su increíble perseverancia al buscar trabajo, su pasión casi obstinada para aprender inglés (créanme, no hablaba una sola palabra) y la descomunal energía que tiene para lavar platos hasta altas horas de la madrugada, sabiendo que en pocas horas debe levantarse de nuevo a estudiar. Mari es fuerte, pero para enfrentar este reto necesita un poco de ayuda. Un pequeño empujón, no es más. Los médicos acaban de diagnosticarla con “carcinoma papilar de tiroides”, y según el dictamen está en Categoría VI, lo que quiere decir que tiene alto grado de malignidad y el procedimiento a seguir de acuerdo con los médicos, sería la remoción quirúrgica.Así es, estamos luchando contra el tiempo.Mari debe someterse a una cirugía llamada TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY + CENTRAL NECK DISSECTION lo antes posible, pues en este punto de la historia cada minuto, literalmente, es vital.Nunca, en ningún momento de nuestro viaje a Australia, esperamos vernos enfrentados a un reto como este (venimos a pasarlo bien ¿no?). Pero los problemas llegan y hay que ponerles el pecho; claro está, hacerlo es mucho más fácil si contamos con apoyo.Maricel dice todo el tiempo que su mayor preocupación es estar sola en este país, y necesitamos la ayuda de todos ustedes para demostrarle que no es así; que aunque su mamá está lejos, en Australia tiene una familia inmensa que está dispuesta a hacer lo que sea necesario para salvarle la vida. Hemos creado este fondo para ayudarle a costear los gastos de su tratamiento; pues aunque afortunadamente el seguro médico cubre el valor de la cirugía, Mari no puede volver a trabajar durante los próximos dos meses, lo que implica que no tendrá dinero para cubrir los gastos durante su proceso de recuperación (consultas médicas, medicinas, vivienda y alimentación).Básicamente queremos quitarle a Mari la preocupación de no tener trabajo en Australia (todos sabemos lo que significa eso), durante sus dos meses de convalecencia. ¡Queremos que se concentre en recuperarse!Si además del apoyo económico, tienes alguna otra forma de ayudarnos a que Mari supere esta dura prueba, te estaremos eternamente agradecidos.-----Mari’s story began just like anyone else who has come to this country, facing her fears and taking on new challenges to grow as a person. Nevertheless, Australia has been tougher on Mari than on most of us, and today she is facing what is perhaps the biggest challenge that anyone could ever face on this journey: a fight against cancer. But Mari is strong! I know her. I’ve seen her incredible determination at finding a job, her dogged passion to learn English (believe me, she couldn’t speak a word when she arrived) and the colossal energy she’s got for washing plates until even the wee hours of the morning, knowing that in just a few hours she would have to get up all over again to study. Mary is strong, but to face this challenge she needs a bit of help. Just a leg up, nothing more. Doctors have recently diagnosed her with papillary thyroid carcinoma, classified at stage 6, meaning it has a high degree of malignancy and that doctors have recommended surgical removal. Indeed, we are in a race against time. Mari must undergo an operation known as TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY + CENTRAL NECK DISSECTION as soon as possible. This late in the game, every minute, literally, is vital. Never, at any moment of our journey in Australia, do we ever expect to find ourselves staring down such a challenge (we’ve all come to have fun, right?). But problems pop up, and we have to give them all we’ve got. If anything’s clear, it’s that doing that is a lot easier when we have people to fall back on. Maricel always says that her biggest worry is being alone in this country, and we need the support of each and every one of you to show her that this isn’t the case; that although she may be far from home, in Australia she has a family that is willing to do whatever it takes to save her life. We have created this fund to help cover the costs of her treatment, since although her medical insurance fortunately covers the cost of the surgery, Mari will be unable to return to work for the following two months, meaning she will lack the money needed to cover her costs during the recovery process (medical appointments, medications, rent and food). Basically, we want to free Mari from the stress of not having a job in Australia (we all know what that’s like) during her two months of recuperation. We want her to focus on getting better! If, beyond just financial support, you have any other way to help Mari along through this difficult test, we will be eternally grateful.",2bb47a10d473048a8a4d0cb5c310e1ef,27,0.4385,7.0,4,0,general,0,1,1,1,1,0.0011299435028248588,0.0011299435028248588,0.5710895788016611,1.0,1.0,gofundme

He has to have costly injections in his eyes regularly ($1,500 per eye every 2-3 months) and has not been able to drive for many months. Because of his vision problems he is no longer able to work.

The Journey has only just begun for them, we cannot, we must not allow it to end prematurely. Please donate and help these children live long healthy lives. There is no health coverage, and there are no government benefits in Armenia. Their only hope is people like you and me.So far, we have helped 54 children, eight of which have already lost their battle. But our resolve to help, and to find the wherewithal to pay for their treatments has only increased. The urgency of the matter cannot be any clearer; the three young lives that were lost are proof of this.PLEASE DONATE AND PLEASE SHARE THIS LINK: https://www.gofundme.com/their-cancer-fight-is-our-fightAbout me: As some of you may already know, my name is Tracy Oganyan. I live in Los Angeles, but travel to Armenia often to help families in need and wounded soldiers. However, last September, during a visit to Armenia for my usual charity work, I was taken to the pediatric oncology department in one of the local hospitals. There, I was introduced to a number of cancer patients (as old as 17, but most of them under the age of 12.) It was heartbreaking to see these young souls whose skin was tainted by radiation and who’s hair have all fallen out because of the Chemotherapy they were receiving. In addition, 90% of the children in that hospital travel from villages outside of Yerevan (the capital of Armenia.)The scene was surreal, and no parent should ever have to or experience what I witnessed. In the United States, people from underprivileged households can get free cancer treatments. However, in countries such as Armenia, there are no such programs. An average income is approximately 2000 dram (+/- $4.12) per day. Yet one course of Chemo is $700-$1000 (depending on the hospital.) Incredibly, even fever medication and antibiotics are out of reach for these families.Upon my return from that trip, I organized multiple fundraisers and collected a considerable amount of funds to pay for the desperately needed chemo. I used the funds to sponsor the children who needed the most urgent care. However, at the rate of $1000 per child, the funds quickly ran out.Disbursement: Once the campaign is completed, I will withdraw the funds and I will send them to Armenia personally. Additionally, I normally travel there every few months for a few weeks each time. As per previous fundraisers, I will take most of the money there myself. However, for immediate needs, a local money transfer company (much like Western Union) has offered to transfer the money raised here on GoFundMe.com to Armenia at no cost to this fundraiser. This, of course, is a huge savings. Once the transfer is completed, two of my associates in Armenia will collect the funds and make the necessary arrangements. (I.e. purchasing medications, paying medical bills at the hospitals, etc.) This is all done with the parents as witnesses, once they have given us permission and the necessary prescriptions.

Gladys shared with us the devastating story of her daughter Sharoll who is only 25 years old. Sharoll was diagnosed with uterine cancer in 2017, since then their entire life has changed...Immediately after the Family learned about this life threatening condition, Gladys returned to Peru to be by her daughter’s side; however, Gladys couldn’t stay long as she needed to return back to work to pay for her daughters treatment. Sharoll started chemotherapy and it appeared that the cancer was in remission. After well over a year of treatment Sharoll started experiencing pain in her leg. Doctors after multiple tests confirmed the worst. They discovered tumors in her leg, and they were indeed carcinogenic stage 4.This situation is even more heartbreaking, because Gladys younger daughter is 13 and autistic. Unfortunately Gladys cannot afford to take time off and fly to Peru to be by her daughters side because most of her income earned here is sent to the doctors to cover the very expensive medical treatments, tests and hospital bills in Peru.Our hearts and prayers go to Gladys and her Family during this most difficult time.Please consider donating to help Gladys and her daughter Sharoll. EVERY amount, no matter how big or small will be deeply appreciated by the Family!

In 2011 she was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. The doctors in Poland have done everything in their power to save Justyna, unfortunately, conventional medicine in Poland was helpless after the cancer unexpectedly came back in 2015. In the late 2016, Justyna's condition was worsening dramatically with every day that has passed.  The tumor had spread into the spinal cord. This time the chemo did not help and with the growth of the tumor Justyna had lost ability to walk. We are in the process of treating our last chance! A brain tumor is a terribly difficult opponent, which is why this fight is extremely demanding. However, had Justyna remained in Poland, there would be no question of a fight because she would not be with us anymore. The medicine there is helpless. Fortunately, Justyna is a fighter. She continues to fight and will not give up and until the cancer finally gives up. Thanks to people with generous hearts, Justyna is still alive. In April she flew to a clinic in Monterrey, Mexico - the one remaining place that gave her hope to save her. Tumors in the core have largely decreased and there is continuing hope that they will completely disappear. Justyna has been given chemo through the femoral artery to the spinal cord and through the Ommaya reservoir directly to the head, because detailed diagnostics showed that the tumor is there.  In addition to cancer, there is one more enemy - the passage of time. By February 4, we have to pay for the next cycle of chemotherapy, for which we have no money. Then for the next cycle after that ... We are afraid to think about what will happen if we do not make our goal.

Leah is the mother of 4 kind, outstanding children; they were all raised in our community since they were babies and their father has taken care of the Sephardic Synagogue for nearly decades. Inevitably this extreme circumstance will take a huge toll on Moti, the father, and he is planning on doing whatever is necessary to take off work and be there for the children and for Leah throughout her treatment and recovery.  It is hard to believe that this is happening to Leah. We are devastated by this sudden news. The Moryosef family has been living in San Diego for 18 years now. This is the longest that Leah has lived anywhere.

She is currently very busy scheduling appointments to see where else the cancer has spread amongst other doctors appointments. Leah is a devoted mother, a professional speech pathologist, an amazing Opera singer, an overall radiant and intelligent woman but most importantly she is a kind and gentle spirit.   Leah wants everyone to know that since this reality has unfolded she has found a greater appreciation for every sacred moment in life.She is committed to her family, her community and her career and she is fiercely determined to live a full life. Anyone who knows Leah can attest to her strength and will and they know that she will work as hard as humanly possible to beat the odds!Leah has quite a road to treatment and recovery ahead of her and everyday she is facing new obstacles.

My name is Caroline and on May 14, 2018, I woke up to the discovery of a tumor after a routine colonoscopy. A few tests and a little over a week later, I was officially diagnosed with Stage IV colorectal cancer. Please Help MeI’m on my own and have scarce support from my family. My beloved mother died of breast cancer 32 years ago and her death devastated us. For the past few weeks, I’ve been in a lot of pain and unable to do even the most basic of day-to-day chores. Up until recently, I’d been trying to handle almost everything myself. The treatment for this type of cancer takes about a year or so. I am unable to work, and will not be able to work for, at least, another eight or nine months, if all goes well.Asking for any kind of help, especially for money, is difficult. The recent fires, natural disasters, mass shootings and perpetual social causes, has had me questioning if I’m worthy of even asking you for help. It’s taken me months to get the courage and it’s required me to confront the urgent need that I’m in. So here I am, buckling down to share my story, in the hope that you will think my life and my cause are worthy of your compassion and generosity. Would you please make a donation to help me fight this war against cancer?  No amount is too small and I am grateful that you’re reading this and considering it. With your donations, I hope to be able to cover my basic living and health expenses for the next year and pay down part of my growing medical debt. Would you also please share my story with your acquaintances, friends and family who might be inclined to help me? I’d appreciate it.How It StartedThe only warning signs I had about the cancer was a change in bowel movements. I explored possible causes: gluten-intolerance, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, depression, peri-menopause, maybe even a parasite (I had eaten unwashed lettuce in a sandwich at the local farmer’s market.) It wasn’t until my OB/GYN suggested I get a colonoscopy that I started on the path to learning the truth. I was turning 50, it was time to get one anyway.  I put it off for several months (and I’m ashamed of this),  because the preparation and procedure sounded yucky. In all my months of doctors visits trying to figure this out, no doctor had suggested I might have cancer. I’m one of the healthiest people you’ll ever meet. Even now, if you saw me on the street, you wouldn’t know that I’m battling such a beast. All of this was a massive shock.How Am I Feeling Right Now?  I'm happy to be done with radiation and the oral chemo, but the pain and side effects have been compounding. I'm very uncomfortable, and have just been trying to rest and manage the pain. I’ve been advised that I should start to feel better in a couple more weeks. Still…I’m afraid. I’m afraid to ask for money. I’m afraid I won’t receive what I need to maintain my basic needs, never mind my medical bills. I’m afraid I will be shamed and criticized for needing to ask for help.I’m afraid I will never feel really healthy again.I’m afraid I’ll never teach Bikram yoga again.I’m afraid I’ll never travel again. I’m afraid I’ll never experience desire, passion and romantic love again. I’m afraid I won’t be able to pursue the dreams I’ve buried for decades and have only recently unearthed. I’m afraid you’ll laugh at me if I tell you about my dreams for my future, post-cancer.I’m afraid you’re comparing my story to Becoming by Michelle Obama and will find me lacking. I’m afraid you’ll want to come visit me and I won’t be able to hold my fart in.I’m afraid you won’t want to be around me because I have cancer.I’m afraid that over time more and more friends will drift away because this is HARD.I’m afraid I won’t be able to overcome this battle with cancer.I’m afraid but I also have so much hope. I am fighting hard to stay optimistic and positive, because I deeply believe in the power of positive thinking.I believe that cancer is my teacher and that as I fight to eradicate it from my body, I am also to learn life-changing lessons from it. What's The Game Plan? The primary tumor is in my rectum and it’s metastasized to both of my lungs. On June 28th, I began the first of six rounds of chemotherapy (FOLFOX) infusions and completed them in September. On November 12th, I completed 28 days of radiation treatment with oral chemotherapy, which took place over a course of six weeks.I’ll see my radiation oncologist this Monday for a follow-up, and then meet with my oncologist in early December to discuss the next steps. There will be more tests and scans. There will surely be meetings with my oncology surgeon. The tentative plan is to have my first surgery in January to remove the primary tumor in my rectum. A couple of months after that, I’ll have a second surgery to resect my colon and have the tumors in my lungs removed. There will be more chemotherapy infusions. The first time I met my oncologist, she told me that she sees me and my cancer as curable, based on my overall health. If you look at statistics, that puts me in a small percentage. Colorectal cancer is on the rise around the world, so funding and research has increased, and breakthroughs are being made all the time. I also believe in my health care team, my overall good health (despite the cancer) and my resolve to fight cancer and win. Depression and CancerI was severely depressed for almost two years before I was diagnosed with cancer. It began with a relationship that ended violently and it blindsided me. As I began to attempt to pick up the pieces, there were two consecutive, separate, abusive employers who took advantage of my vulnerability at different stages. Finally there was the realization that I could no longer support myself in the yoga teaching career I loved and had invested ten years into. Each of those things drove me deeper and deeper into depression. It is a miracle to me that I survived those days, and I owe that to friends near and far.Almost exactly a year ago, I had started to re-discover myself through improvisation classes and then later, a writing class. These two creative activities along with my yoga practice gave me some breaks from depression and started to kindle a sense of self-worth within me.How ironic it was to start to come out of that black hole of depression to learn that I had cancer. It was in that same week that I realized that if I had survived so many suicidal thoughts, I was not going to let myself die from cancer. Still, nothing prepares you for how hard this treatment is and I still struggle trying to stay out of that abyss.Looking AheadWhen I am cancer free, I hope to find meaningful work that can support me. I am probably going to have to find a new career, which is daunting when you're over 50. I also hope to be able to give back to the community that has supported me. I would like to advocate for patients like me, who are fighting cancer on their own. I've been invited by one of my nurses to help their hospital improve their patient care, by sharing my experiences. I hope to see friends and enjoy meals with them. I hope to be able to travel and have more adventures. I want to fall in love again and be truly loved. I want to pursue my dreams of writing and acting. Most of all, I'll be so grateful to be and feel healthy again. Thank you.",27e163cf04b644cc5749f7ceeb0a127a,69,0.2189111111111111,60.0,6,1,breast cancer,0,8,0,6,0,0.005661712668082095,0.0,0.16810285870605937,15.947212645887827,0.0,gofundme

In the original post I had been diagnosed with stage 4 cervical cancer. I was fighting the cancer & I did 4 rounds of radiation therapy along with 9 rounds of chemotherapy. After the 6th round of chemotherapy my gynecologist oncologist had me do a pet scan. This was going to be my first pet scan after doing my radiation and chemotherapy. This scan was basically going to show if the chemo and radiation worked at all. I didn’t have much hope because I was told I was given only a 10% chance to live. The tumor on top of my right cervix was the size of my fist (about 11cmx8cm all the way around). I had death set in my mind & I was terrified of the results. Much to my surprise the results were great. The tumor had shrunk so much that they could barely see it on the screen. Since this was after my 6th chemo session, my doctor ordered 3 more sessions so we could try and nip the tumor in the bud. My doctor said that my body had responded so well to the chemo & being young didn’t hurt either. After the 9th session my doctor ordered another pet scan. This time I felt a bit more hopeful, but still had the thought of death in the back of my mind. The results came back and I was in remission. He said that the tumor was gone and I was cancer free. I was so happy I started crying & finally had some hope for my future. I asked my doctor what the next step is. He said there was this new drug called Keytruda aka Pembrolizumab. He said that it’s a good thing to take after chemo, a great post cancer medication. He said the success rates were high & that he believed in it & I should take it. My doctor saved my life before my choosing the right amount of radiation, the right chemo meds & premeds, so why wouldn’t I trust his judgement? I excitedly agreed and told him I was game. He said that he wanted to do 10 sessions (3 weeks apart) from each other. What Keytruda is supposed to do is strengthen the immune system so it can target any new cancer cells & basically stop new cancer cells from growing. It also helps with your white blood cell count. This sounded amazing so I couldn’t wait to get started. The problem was my insurance wasn’t covering it and each session was $10,000 & my doctor was requesting 10. That means I would’ve needed to shell $100,000. Keytruda seemed like a lifesaver & a great post cancer treatment & the success rates were high, so I was determined to make this happen for me. That’s when I originally started this gofundme. The original goal point was past $100,000. Thankfully my great nurse at UCI Medical was able to speak to my insurance and they agreed to cover my sessions which was a huge relief to me because I thought there was no way in hell I was going to be able to raise $100k. It took a few weeks to start my treatment. It was just like my chemotherapy where I did a session every 3 weeks. After my 6th session that I did on my 1/5/19, I had my next pet scan set up for 1/11/19. I was very scared because this was going to be my first pet scan after doing Keytruda for 6 months. This scan would determine if I was still cancer free or not, and it would also determine if the Keytruda has been working or not. I was beyond terrified and my anxiety was through the roof for over a week about this scan. I did my scan on 1/11/19 and got my results at my gynecologist oncologist appointment on 1/14/19. I sat in the room with Paul (thank goodness he took the day off work so he can be with me and support me) and about 4 other doctors besides my main doctor and nurse came in. I sat there dying waiting for them to pull the image of my scan up. There was a yellow circle to the left of where my original tumor was, about an inch over my belly button. My doctor said that the yellow circle was a new tumor. And then he basically said that I have cancer again & that I am going to be stopping Keytruda immediately because it wasn’t working for me. So many emotions washed over me as I sat there in disbelief. I was angry, sad, dazed, freaking out, tuning everything out, I just wanted to run. The good news is that we caught the tumor early & that it is waaaaaay smaller than my first tumor. This tumor is 12mm & one of the doctors compared it to the size of my pinky nub. So since we caught the tumor early & the tumor was smaller I asked my doctor if the stage of my cancer was different. He said no, that the stage will always be the same. So unfortunately I still have stage 4 cervical cancer. I will be taking new chemo drugs, and fortunately these won’t make me lose my hair. There is a small percentage of course, but my doctor said it’s very small. If anything my hair will thin so I will get vitamins and shampoo and hair stuff for that. I will be getting a phone call from my nurse sometime this week with details about my chemotherapy. The plan is 3 sessions, but the way the sessions work is kind of weird. 1 session is throughout a period of 3 consecutive days. Each day I go in and it’s a 6 hour long period. After the 3rd day the session is done. I have to do that 3 times every 3 weeks. After the third session is done I will be doing another pet scan to see if the cancer has spread, shrunk, disappeared, or if I need more chemo. This time around the chemo meds I will be taking are called: Carboplatin and Topotecan. Now since I am unemployed and have been for almost 3 years now, most of you can see that I’m not in the best financial situation. I do get disability from the government, but that barely covers my HOA payment, electric bill (yes I’m in the CARE program, but my bills still come out to $30-40), cell phone bill, monthly necessities (ie: toilet paper, paper towels, napkins, etc), food and kitty litter for my 3 legged cat Calvin, and groceries. I do have food stamps but the amount I get barely covers 2 weeks worth of food (if that) and I barely eat... if you know me then you know how skinny I am. I am thankful that I have government assistance, but unfortunately it doesn’t cover everything. I am also trying to pay back my property tax/back taxes on my condo. As I mentioned earlier my mother left me her condo in her inheritance when she passed away in 2013 from colon cancer. When I had a job I was able to cover both the HOA and the property tax. Since losing my job I was barely able to keep my head above water and was only able to pay the HOA. I haven’t been able to pay my property tax that has now become back taxes since 2016. I am on a slow route to losing my home, my only asset, the only thing my mother has left me. The donations from this campaign will go directly to either paying off all the taxes (depending on how much they are, OR putting a down payment so foreclosure stops & I will be making payments). I have such great friends and you guys are the majority of my donations. I want to thank you guys from the bottom of my heart because without you guys I wouldn’t have any donations. As most of you know I don’t have any family members to fall back on to help me financially. My father passed away from a heart attack when I was 16, and my mother passed away from colon cancer when I was 23. I am 29 now... this cancer nightmare started for me when I was 27. I was 27 when I was diagnosed with stage 4 cervical cancer aka “Endocervical Adenocarcinoma”. I also found out I was anemic & that my hemoglobin (blood level) was at a 3. A normal woman my age at the time (27) should have a hemoglobin of a 12 or 13. I was dangerously underweight, I am 5”8 and I was 89lbs. I had to undergo around 6 blood transfusions to get me back to normal. I was in the ICU for over a week. Then I was transported to 4 different hospitals. I was in the hospital system for over a month (11/12/17 - 12/22/17). I missed Thanksgiving, my 28th bday (Dec 8), and almost Xmas. I didn’t even have a cell phone at the time so I was all alone. It was a hard decision for me to make a gofundme because I literally thought that everyone on the face of the earth either didn’t like me, or didn’t care that I had cancer. I’m so glad that I overcame that fear and made this page because I proved myself wrong & so many of you guys have donated, some multiple times. This makes me sooooooo happy. I do have to apologize for one thing though... I apologize that I am constantly posting my campaign all the time. I apologize that I am constantly asking for donations. There is a reason behind it though, the reason is that you guys are literally all I have. Like I said I have absolutely no family. Even the family I have left which is my half brother and half sister, I was taken full advantage of by them. They took advantage of my sickness. They tried to reap all of the benefits that I was receiving. They were stealing money from me and lying to me. They made a personal “debt” that I owe them for what they did for me before I started receiving benefits. My half sister and brother literally kept every single receipt they spent on me and put them all into an excel sheet. For example I had a full functioning working microwave. For some reason, without me asking them, they bought me a new microwave. Then boom $70 into the excel sheet. I was grateful that they bought me a new microwave, but I was under the impression that they did it out of the kindness of their heart. Another example, they bought me a new toaster oven. Didn’t have one, but didn’t want one or ask for one. Another $80 into the excel sheet. Then once my benefits rolled in each month my sister took out $200 out of my benefits before transferring the rest of my benefits into my account. She set up a joint account where I had a debit card. I had no access to the website & if I went to the bank I was denied any information because that’s how my half sister set it up. She lied on documents, she impersonated me, that’s how she got my benefits and other things for me. Then she spoke with a lawyer. She told the lawyer that she was speaking on behalf of me and they wrote up a contract. The contract was for me to agree to selling my condo to her. I read the contract and something smelled extremely fishy so I told her that I would have to read it again & maybe speak with someone else who understands the lawyer language better. Every person I showed the contract to laughed and basically asked if it was a joke. Everyone advised me not to sign it. I told my sister that I wasn’t going to sign the contract and because of that I was getting punished. Starting that month instead of taking $200 from my benefits before receiving them, she started taking $300. This went on for a few months before i mustered up the strength to speak to someone because I was scared of my half sister. She literally had so much power over me, she controlled every aspect of my life. I felt powerless under her & she made me feel that way too. Later I learned that she was committing grand larceny, conspiracy, impersonation, lying, and she is now getting investigated by the federal government. I no longer speak to my half brother either because he was also in cahoots with my half sister. The only other family I have that I speak to are my 3 cousins. We are all around the same age. I’m not going to use names out of privacy. I have my oldest cousin “J” and she is 30, then there’s “S” and she’s 29 (she’s 2 weeks older than me), then there’s me 29, and then there’s “H” and she’s 27. I asked all 3 of them to donate and I didn’t expect them to donate $100 or something, but I expected them to donate something because we are family and they know they’re all I have. “J” said she couldn’t because she had just moved to Florida & just got a job. Yet I see her on social media & she’s constantly eating out, drinking beer, going out, getting coffee. I think to myself “you really couldn’t spare $5-10 for your dying cousin?”. Then there was “H”, she said she couldn’t donate for the same reason pretty much, and she’s doing basically the same thing as “J”, going out, eating out, going to bars, etc. I had the same thought “you’re doing all these things & claim you’re broke, you really couldn’t spare $5-10?”. What surprised me the most is “S”. When I asked her about donating her answer was the most baffling. She said that she didn’t feel comfortable donating because she thinks that people who use gofundme for donations are basically the same as people begging for money on the side of the freeway. I was beyond appalled when she said that. She and I got into an argument about that and then she proceeded to block me on all social media & on the phone. So that’s my family for you. All my aunts and uncles are either passed on, or I haven’t seen them in 10+ years and don’t have their phone numbers. All my mom’s side of the family lives in Korea & I have no contact with them. The last time I spoke with my uncle who is actually a really successful businessman (he helped my mom buy this condo for me) said I was a disgrace to the family because I have yet to visit my moms grave in Korea. She passed away in Korea and was getting her cancer treatment in Korea because she couldn’t afford to here in the US, so my uncle took care of her. The thing he doesn’t understand is 1) I would LOVE to go visit my family in Korea, I haven’t been since I was 10 years old. 2) I don’t have a passport and I don’t know where my birth certificate is (my mom had all my documents, I even had to file to get a new social security card). 3) There is no way I can afford a round trip ticket to Korea (he is not willing to help pay). 4) I don’t know Korean and it will be hard to navigate myself without an interpreter, I can barely navigate around the US because I’m bad with directions. 5) I would have nowhere to stay while in Korea. 6) I am now sick and have been for over a year so I cannot leave the country. If my uncle were willing to help me of course I would be there. Anyways, I know that was very long, but I just had to explain to you guys my family situation & the intensity of it. You guys, my wonderful friends are my family. And that’s why I have to keep campaigning to you guys because I don’t have a larger audience. Thank you to everyone who has donated and to the people who have donated multiple times, and to the the people who have shared my campaign link so others can see/read my story. Closing, please donate if you can. The campaign will be up until the goal is met. Any amount is appreciated and will help me to reach my overall goal. One of my 2019 goals is to reach my campaign goal by the end of the year. I’m hoping sooner than later. If you absolutely cannot donate, PLEASE share my campaign link! It is proven that sharing works & it spreads my voice and message to people I cannot reach. That would be much appreciated. I know that this was extremely long so I will end it with this note: if you are reading this today please be selfless and make a donation of any size. Instead of buying that cup of coffee at Starbucks drink coffee at home & donate instead. Instead of going out to eat for lunch or dinner, eat at home & donate instead. Instead of going out to the bar and wasting money on overpriced cocktails or beer, drink at home instead & donate. Please keep that in mind and do a good deed today! I sure could use all the help that I can get, thank you from the bottom of my heart!!!-Liz (ORIGINAL POST) —thought I would leave it here so people can see. Hi everyone! My name is Liz and I’m a 29 year old cervical cancer survivor. I originally made this gofundme to raise money for Keytruda which is a new medication that my doctor wanted me to take to stay in remission. It isn’t covered by insurance because it’s so new. I also was raising money to pay back my taxes on my condo which I inherited from my mother who passed away from colon cancer back in 2013. I haven’t been able to pay my taxes due to unemployment, mental disabilities, and my sickness. I owe from 2016-now. I am updating the main page today (7/24/18) because my wonderful doctors and nurses talked to my insurance and got me approved for Keytruda! I am approved for 5-6 infusions, and then they will work to get me the rest of the infusions. My doctor wants me to do 10 in total. I am still going to be accepting donations to help pay back my taxes and for healing and basic living. In those areas I still need help and would appreciate all of it! It would mean the world to me if you still think I am worthy of a donation. I am still unemployed and need lots of help with living costs. Thank you all so much for your support!! It means the world to me!UPDATE 8/9/18I have finally set up my beneficiary for my funding, and of course I chose Paul. He is connected to me because I trust him and we share a bank account and also because he has been my rock and support throughout my journey. I would be nowhere without him. He has been keeping me positive and sane throughout this whole cancer journey. We have a joint account at School’s First Credit Union and he is the main one on the account where I am the joint and he is the only one with the savings account. We want to save until we actually hit our goal, so we thought it would be smarter to have Paul be my beneficiary and have the donations get sent straight to his savings account. There was a deadline to do this and we finally did it last night, we only had 2 more days to do it lol or we wouldn’t have been able to get any more donations.

My mom is a wonderful mother to me and my 13 year old brother Caleb, and an awesome ""Momo"" to her six grandbabies--spoiling them as much as she can. But, in April of this year my mom (Shannon Sutton) was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer that has spread to her bones.  This was a devestating diagnosis as she had been in pain for a few months dealing with, what we thought, was pain from a car accident when someone rear ended her.  She has remained positive throughout this journey even though she is in constant pain, frequently her pain goes unmanaged.   After radiation treatment and several rounds of chemo, she is currently in chemo management, where she goes and receives chemotherapy every 3 weeks indefinitely.  This drug, while prolonging her life, takes an awful toll on her body.  It is hard for her to attend work every day, and my dad also has been taking off of work to help take care of her.  I come to you all asking for help! I am very helpless in this process but one thing I can do is reach out to you in their time of need.  I am trying to raise some funds that will help purchase a lift recliner for my mom.  She is unable to sleep in a bed due to her pain, and spends a lot of her time in a recliner.  There are some days where the random muscle and joint pain makes it hard for her to get out of the chair herself.  The remaining funds will be given to my parents to help cover some of their co-pays for the countless doctors appointments and to slightly help with the loss of income. Anyone who knows my mom, knows she loves to help people in any way that she can, whether its through service, monetary donations, or offering prayers. So, I am asking if any of you could help pay it forward on her account.  I understand it's a hard time of year for everyone, and any funds will be greatly appreciated.  If you can't help monetarily (and even if you can), please please please pray for her healing and comfort, as that is worth more than any amount of money that can be given.  Thank you so much for loving my mom and family!

I am starting this GoFundMe campaign to help my beloved Ana, who is currently going through a very tough moment in her life.  While she was in the 26th week of pregnancy, doctors detected she had a metastatic  uterine cancer which has spread to her lungs. She went through an emergency c-section, giving birth to our premature baby girl. The baby is now stable, but doctors are still doing tests to verify the baby did not receive any cancerous cells via the placenta.  Ana is currently receiving urgent treatment and hopefully it will stop the cancer spreading to other areas. Ana’s family live overseas and I would like to bring them over so they can spend some time with her in this difficult situation. Their love and support will help Ana cope emotionally with this nightmare that our lives have so suddenly turned into.Bringing her parents, brother and sister will generate travel expenses and other costs which we'll struggle to cover on our own.Not only is there the cost of bringing over Ana's family, but also the financial uncertainty brought by the lack of our family's primary income that would cover mortgage, car loan and the extra unforeseen hospital expenses such as, extra days in daycare for our 2 year old boy, transport, car parking and fuel, and take-away food while I'm in hospital.For that reason, we are calling out for help. Even the smallest donation can help us face this moment with a more solid footing. We cannot express how grateful we would be if you could donate to this cause with whatever is within your capability. Donating or sharing this GoFundMe campaign through your social media network will mean a lot to us (and will give Ana a better chance).Thanks in advance for your support and kindness,Michael Wachholz.________________________________Hola amigos, familia y conocidos. Estamos comenzando este GoFundMe para ayudar a mi amada esposa Ana, quien en estos momentos está atravesando unos momentos muy difíciles. Ella se encontraba en la semana 26 de su embarazo cuando le detectaron cancer de utero con propagación (metastasis) en los pulmones. Lamentablemente la propagacion de los pulmones avanzaba rapidamente, poniendo en riesgo la vida de Ana y nuestra hija. Asi que no hubo otra opcion que hacer una cesaria de emergencia, trayendo al mundo a una bebita prematuramente. Afortunadamente nuestra bebé se encuentra estable, pero los doctores siguen haciendo estudios para determinar si la pequeña está libre de cáncer.La familia de Ana no vive en Australia y yo quisiera que vinieran para que compartieran tiempo con ella en estos momentos tan dificiles. Su apoyo y amor ayudaran a Ana emocionalmente a agarrar fuerzas para enfrentar esta pesadilla en que se ha convertido nuestras vidas en tan solo una semana.Traer a sus padres, hermano y hermana acarrea gastos de viaje, alojamiento, comida, etc. que obviamente no estamos preparados para cubrir.No solo los gastos de traer a la familia de Ana, sino tambien la incertidumbre de no tener parte del ingreso familiar para cubrir compromisos financieraos como el prestamo de la casa, el carro y otros gastos medicos o extras en el futuro como dias extras en la guarderia para nuestro hijo de 2 annos, estacionamiento, transporte, comida afuera cuando me quedo en el hospital, etc.Por esta razones, necesitamos ayuda para seguir adelante y ganarle la batalla al cancer. Hasta el apoyo más pequeno hace la diferencia en este momento de tanta confusión. Les agradecezco con todo mi corazón que nos ayuden donando con lo que esté dentro de sus posibilidades. Por favor, compartan a través de sus redes sociales esta campaña para tener mayor difusión y Ana y nuestra hija puedan recibir mayor ayuda.Muchisimas gracias por su buen corazón y apoyo,Michael Wachholz",01b8278eaff7eac4fe53d1a20eca92b4,21,0.72845,360.0,2,0,general,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

Moran Zukarel is our friend. She lives in Israel with her husband Mor and their three children Idan (9), Or (5), and Bar (2). Moran is an attorney, happily married, who until recently lead an ordinary life just like you and me. Two weeks ago when Idan, her 9-year-old son, started throwing up and complaining about headaches. Their pediatrician ran some tests, all came back normal, leading to the conclusion that it’s probably just a virus and time would heal it. Moran felt there was more to it and insisted on getting an MRI. The results turned their lives upside down in one second.A large tumor was found in 9-year-old Idan’s brain. He immediately went into surgery lasting several hours. All family and friends prayed for good news. We all wanted to hear the doctors say the tumor was benign and that Idan can just go back to playing soccer and going to school like every other kid. Unfortunately, the tumor was diagnosed as stage 4 cancer.The family quickly learned that the life saving treatment Idan requires in not available in Israel, and they will have to travel the United Stated to receive the therapy.

As I am writing these words, the family is making arrangements to travel to New Jersey, where Idan will be treated. The cost of the treatment, travel, and accommodation is out of their reach. They are spending all they have, but they need help.  Friends and family are helping as much as possible but that’s not enough. They need our help to fund the treatment. EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS, even if you have just a single dollar to give, that’s a tremendous help. Please, open your heart and wallet, and give as much as you can. We thank you in advance from the bottom of our hearts!Moran's friends.",e78558badc8b044e2e95942fbcd3bb3c,24,0.03599,30.0,5,1,general,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

It was December of last year and a few days away from Christmas. I never thought in a million years that my family would ever go through something like this. When my mom called me after her doctors appointment, I could tell she had been crying. Her voice was shaky, but she was trying to keep it together. She was trying to show me how strong  she is. And let me tell you, through this whole process, she has stayed srtong and positive. I admire her. I don't know if I could ever even pretend to be as strong as she is. The only thing I thought of at that moment was, ""What am I going to do if I lose her?"" My mom is such a strong woman and a very hard worker. She will take on 10 jobs if that is what it takes to pay her bills and her house. She does it all by herself, most of the times  just getting by, but she does it. My mom got her tumor removed from her left breast, along with 4 lymph nodes. So, that was the end of that, right? Wrong. My mom will start chemotherapy, along with radiotherapy and hormone treatment in the upcoming weeks.  Any help for medical bills, house & utility bills is greatly appreciated. I would never want her to lose her house because she couldnt pay. She will be out from work for the next couple months. My son and I love my mom SO much. I know this will be of great help and take a load off her shoulders. At a moment like this, I want her to be focused on staying strong, being positive and NOT worrying about the house and the bills.

In late February 2017, Lois was diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon Cancer, after she started experiencing what we first thought was appendicitis. A CT scan revealed a large (3 inch) mass where the small intestine joins the large intestine (and right next to the appendix). Subsequent scans have confirmed that there are additional tumors lining the abdominal cavity, but gratefully, not affecting any of the other major organs (liver, kidneys, lungs are clean).Lois is now undergoing her first chemotherapy treatment. Our oncologist anticipates a 4 month chemo program, with treatment every other week to shrink the cancer as much as possible. After that, major surgery (HIPAC) to clear out the abdominal cavity (removing the colon, appendix, and other linings), recovery, and then another 2 months of a different chemo. In all, we are anticipating between 8 to 10 months for this to take place. There is strong belief from the oncology team that a cure is possible, and is what we're aimed at. With guidance from her team, we also hope to augment this with holistic and naturopath approaches to help boost her immune system as it will be weakened by the chemo.As an independent, self-employed photography team, we will not be able to work, or only do so at a minimum as we direct our energy and efforts toward Lois' healing. We are asking for support during this difficult time of transition to cover our basic life necessities and restore Lois' health. When possible, we hope to take on commercial assignments (product shots, architectural, branding, etc.) as time and energy allow.As her husband and life-love, my immediate and ongoing focus is to provide as much of a positive and healing environment as I possibly can, so that Lois can focus on what it takes to beat this. Lois is extremely strong, upbeat and indomitable, and believes that we will overcome this. I continue to build and nurture her in all ways, physically, mentally, and spiritually, and we both are extremely appreciative of the help, love, and encouragement from the dear people in our lives.Thank you all for your support.Jerry Levin",3b4daad94b66b7e203b9c84608a881af,14,0.8283066666666666,660.0,4,1,colon cancer,0,1,0,1,0,0.0026246719160104987,0.0,0.8457399103139014,1.7279686718373257,0.0,gofundme

She is 31 years old, Married and a mother of 4 beautiful children (ages 12,10,19 month old TWINS) Stephanie is active, non smoker and otherwise healthy. This devastating news has left her family and friends heartbroken, and has left her husband Ryan with the unimaginable and overwhelming tasks of arranging care for their 4 children/19 month old twins, managing treatment schedules, and figuring out how to pay for it all.They plan to fight this cancer aggressively, and will do whatever it takes to get Stephanie the best care in the country, with or without the support of their health insurance. But they need your help to make this possible. Please, give what you can to help this special family. The funds will go toward: medical expenses, travel expenses (if they need to travel for state-of-the-art treatments), and general day-to-day expenses that will become difficult to manage.As you can imagine, her family are in a whirl of emotions, but we want nothing more than to get Stephanie healthy to see her 4 beautiful children grow up.

Daniel and I returned to his home country for urgent care, but he has been without medical care for over a month with nephroscopy bags draining from his kidneys. Due to the corrupt and inept privatized health care system in Colombia, he been denied care here, even though he is paying monthly for the insurance plan. The nephrosopy bags and tubes are the same ones surgically inserted the US and although one is leaking we have been unable to find them here. Daniel had to literally tape up the bag to prevent it from leaking everywhere (the hospital sent Daniel off to look for one all over the city).Daniel is literally fighting for his life. It is common in Colombia for people to apply for a Tutela, which is essentially an application for a court order obliging the insuror to provide the payee with care, medication or whatever may be in issue or being withheld. We got an Urgent Provisional Order from the court that Coomeva, the medical health care insuror, set Daniel up with a Urologist Oncologist and get him the radiography tests needed immediately. Yesterday, the company refused to comply with the order sighting only procedural delays and the absurd excuse that the company is ""going through a difficult time right now"". We are now left with nothing except to wait for the Judge's Sentence and Order on the non-provisional Tutela. The struggle continues to try to access care here and we have thus set up a GoFundMe account to raise money to pay out of pocket for the oncologist, MRIs, contrast xrays and chemiotherapy. Please help in any way you can by sharing with as many as you can and with any small donation. If you share Daniel's story and share perhaps how you know him maybe we can get him what he needs.  We don't want to pester our same facebook friends with this. If you have donated prior please know that we can't thank you enough. Some have even donated twice and astounded us with your love and generosity.

Upon further analysis, her cancer was re-diagnosed as  Ewing's Sarcoma. This is a very rare cancer that grows in bones and soft tissues around bones, such as cartilage or the nerves. It trypically occurs in children and young adults, and is highly uncommon for adults. Julia's sarcoma was located on her chest wall, and because of its location, it was originally diagnosed as breast cancer. Because of the new diagnosis, Julia will have to continue chemotherapy. The new medication administered during her chemo may affect her fine motor skills and may cause numbness to her hands. She's usually very exhausted after chemo treatments and requires help with her children. Julia and Chris were traveling to Manhattan for each round of chemo (chemo is now administered closer to Julia's home). Parking and their hotel cost about $1,000 each trip when they have to come down to NYC. Your donation will help to cover those travel expenses, lost wages, and medical expenses not covered by insurance. If you would prefer to donate via PayPal, you may send donations directly to Julia's email address, Mav510@msn.comTHANK YOU!- - - - - - - - - - - - - - In November 2016, my future sister-in-law Julia was diagnosed with metaplastic breast cancer (click the link for specific information). This type of breast cancer is extremely rare and agressive, and it accounts for fewer than 1% of all breast cancers. Treatment for this cancer is tricky as it can have metastasis (when the cancer has spread beyond the breast).Julia is a wife and a mother to three children. Her diagnosis is a shock to us all.Julia will be starting three rounds of chemo soon. Her tumor is very large (around 5-6cm), and it is attached to the chest wall. She will be reassessed after her first round of chemo to see if her tumor is shrinking. If chemo is unsucessful, she will have surgery. Post surgery, she will need radiation every day for six weeks. Her treatment will most likely continue until June 2017.Julia and her family live in Poughkeepsie, NY. Because she is being treated by experts at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York, NY, her travel expenses are upwards of $50 per day. Each day Julia travels to New York City for treatment, she and her husband Chris are unable to work. Your donation would not only cover their travel expenses, they would also cover their lost wages.Julia has already had multiple ultrasounds, biopsies, MRIs, and a PET scan.

A decir verdad, en el momento se me nublaron los pensamientos el día que me lo dijo el cirujano. Pero junto a mi esposo y mis 3 hijos, decidimos enfrentar este proceso juntos. ¿Que si emocionalmente se afectaron? pues sí. Pero lo que les ayudó a ellos y a toda persona que me rodea, fue mi sonrisa y mi actitud. En vez de yo ser fortalecida, yo daba fortaleza a aquel que se preocupaba.

La trayectoria ha sido un camino fácil de recorrer, ya que mi actitud siempre ha sido positiva. He tenido un grupo de apoyo de gente hermosa, la cual dentro de todo me han ayudado económicamente para el proceso, al menos para mis tratamiento y citas medicas durante los meses de junio a octubre. La mastectomía fue realizada para el mes de noviembre. Durante ese tiempo, mis cuidadores fueron mi amado esposo y mi madre. Como leerán, mi esposo estuvo presente durante todo ese tiempo; en mis días de citas, en mi cirujía y luego cuidando de mi.

My father used to be a social worker and have always stood for needy and helpless people. He has sowed seeds of love, compassion and humbleness in me. About couple of years ago, doctors recognized that my dad has a tumour in his colon of around 10 cms in length and 7 cms in width and height. He was already suffering from depression and hypertension from last 6-7 years. We took loans to support my studies in Canada and for my dad’s treatment. We have already spent 22 lakhs (44k$) on his treatment, Which was near to impossible for us. We have to take loans from banks and relatives. Monthly expense on his medicines and chemotherapies comes around 1 lakh rupees (2000$). Now the doctors are recommending immunotherapy for which we need atleast 8-10 lacs rupees i.e 20k CADs. I know there’s cheap treatments available in government hospitals. There’s a lot of waiting for just getting a bed in these hospitals, even we have applied to government schemes for help. When we finally got registered at a government hospital, doctor wasn’t able to give any relief and surgery didn’t went well. Now they’re refusing to take the case again. And we don’t have much time to decide and delay the treatment because cancer is at stage four. I am the only one who works to support household and everything. I need to pay for my brother’s school fees and loan Emi’s at the same time. I am losing control on everything. As a student, I cannot do much. I work more than I am legally allowed.

  Dean hopes to attend (wearing a mask of course and with doctor approval).    Prayers for Dean that this is possible because he is really looking forward to a change in scenery and that Chemo can restart soon with good results.   Thank you everyone for your ongoing support.  He sees all your words of encouragement, so keep'm coming!   Dean truly is amazing.  He is NOT giving in and does his best to remain positive throughout these setbacks.  Dana1/3/2019 Update:  Yesterday Dean did round 2 of Chemo here in Sacramento.  Because the bilirubin count was still a bit high, his doctor opted for another 80% treatment.  He came home yesterday attached to a small mobile pump that will be removed on Friday.    As for the origin of the cancer itself.....still waiting.   Meanwhile, pray that the tumors in the liver respond and start to shrink and that the side affects associated with treatment are at a minimum.   To all of you, thank you for your ongoing support and love for my brother!   Dana  12/26/18 Update:  Dean finished 1st chemo round on Friday,  12/21/18, in San Francisco and came back home with Cindy to Sacramento the next day.  So, the battle begins.  He is looked well considering!   We had our typical Christmas Eve family and friends celebration at our house (Kelly's)  with lots of singing, presents, and food (and the Raiders won)!  It was wonderful to have Dean there (he wore a mask!).   We are still waiting on additional test/biopsy results to pinpoint the type of cancer.   More to come.  I hope you all had a blessed Christmas!  Dana12/19/18 Update:   Dean's surgeon at UCSF installed a stent in the biliary duct yesterday evening during the endoscopy procedure.     There is a possibility that Dean does not have pancreatic cancer, but rather biliary duct cancer.   With the stent, hopefully the bilirubin can drain.   He had a rough night.  Cindy is providing us with regular updates.  Thank you Cindy!   Chemo starts today in San Francisco.  Thank you for all the prayers!12/18/18 Update:  There's been a set back.  Dean is now at UCSF undergoing additional tests.  He went there Sunday late with Cindy and Lily.  Because his bilirubin shot up, chemo cannot start until the cause of the blockage is determined and addressed.  Dean is mighty yellow due to jaundice.    He had a CT scan last night, awaiting the radiology report, and later today he will undergo another endoscopy (possibly ERCP).     He has the best doctors circling the wagons.    Dean continues with his sense of humor like only Dean can!    Thank you to all!  Dana Kelly12/13/18 Update:  Dean just now got out of surgery to have the port placed in order to begin chemo.   The doctor was very pleased with how this big procedure went!  On Monday he has an oncology consult at  UCSF with Dr. Ko who is a colleague of Dean's Oncologist, Dr. Javeed,  here in Sacramento.  We should find out soon when the actual treatments will begin and of course, continue providing updates as we learn more.  Again, we thank all of you for your ongoing support through GFM and for the many prayers, words of encouragement, and picture posts!  Dean sees and reads all of them!  Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.   Dana Kelly 916-847-6864.    12/6/18 Update:  Hi Everyone, Dean was officially diagnosed this morning with pancreatic cancer.   He will start chemo immediately.  Bill and I (Dana) want you all to know how overwhelmed he is with the support that has been pouring in from family and friends across the world, and from people who don't even know him!  You are all amazing with your ongoing love and encouragement and gifts that will remove such a huge financial stressor for Dean as he fights this.  I have shared with many that my brother never asks for anything....he only gives.  We thank all of you.  God bless you.  Keep the faith and prayers flowing.  Dean has just been diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic cancer.  We love him and want to do all we can to help.  If you would like to support him,  please donate.  It's easy!Updates will be posted as we learn more.",83e39e3120b318a81be5ae32fd8db8eb,69,0.6174,30.0,5,1,pancreatic cancer,0,2,0,2,0,0.0021413276231263384,0.0,0.4353009036723707,4.568493574707711,0.0,gofundme

She is in her last year of school at ASU but will have to take a break until after her treatments.  She will also have to stop working so she can concentrate all of her energy and efforts on this fight against cancer.Andrea has the great support of her mother, a dear friend to many, Laurie.  When Laurie was quite a bit younger than Andrea, she herself battled a different type of cancer.  She’s as feisty as her daughter and kicked cancer’s ass…which is exactly what Andrea is going to do.  But while she’s fighting and Laurie is doing everything she can to support Andrea and little Max, we can help too.  If you can find it in your hearts to donate to this fund, you will have the satisfaction of knowing you are helping a hard working family who have many hills to climb in the upcoming months.  Andrea, Laurie and Max’s family and friends thank each and every one of you for reading her story and showing your support.Isaiah 41:10 “So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God.

Steve has cancer.As is usually the case, Steve didn’t always have cancer. He has always been a healthy guy. Healthy, overwhelmingly positive, kind. In all the years I’ve known Steve I would be more than hard pressed to come up with one person he had ever been anything but nice to. Steve is one of those people that makes you wish you were better at being a person. Steve is better at everything he does than I am at any one thing I do. When his time as a drummer for international touring bands came to an end he just up and decided to learn photography and videography.  He mastered the arts and became a highly sought after artisan. He can make the most important day of one person’s life look like the most important day in history. Steve is authentic; he is the genuine article. Steve is the brother I never had.Steve had spent a little time in the hospital recently because he was having stomach issues, which turned out to be an ulcer.  When he told be me he had spent a few nights in the hospital I raised my voice and became cross with him for not telling me. He is my best friend. I could help.November 6. He texted me the day he found out the particularly problematic ulcer wasn’t healing correctly. It wasn’t healing because the ulcer had cancer in it. He was going to have surgery to remove part of his middle stomach.  This is very common, just not in someone Steve’s age. 33. Scary problem, easy fix. This would be the first of many times that we would hear the phrase “extremely uncommon in someone your age.”November 9. Surgery day. Procedure was to start at 1pm. I wished him the best, hoped for even better and waited to hear everything went well.  At 6pm I got a text, “Surgery took longer than expected… they ended up taking out his entire stomach.” What? Is that even a thing? Can someone live without a stomach? What could they have possibly found that would make them think it was a good idea to remove his entire stomach? It wasn’t until the next day that we found out the answer: cancer. Lots of cancer. We cried. They removed his entire stomach and twenty-seven lymph nodes and sent it all off to a lab. The doctors told him they sent it off to see if they “got it all.” My immediate response was how can they see if they “got it ALL” by looking at what is out of his body already? Probably not the most helpful.November 16.  A week after surgery and we were anxiously (nervously) waiting to hear back about the results. Results came back: Not good.  He has aggressive, invasive stage 3 gastric adenocarcinoma.  His entire stomach was engulfed in it. Thirteen of the lymph nodes had it. When receiving the news, ever-optimistic Steve was taking it all with the positivity only Steve could. The doctor said to Steve “I don’t think you understand how serious this is.” Whoa. Ouch. Okay. So we’re doomed?That escalated quickly.It was just an ulcer. Then the ulcer had cancer. Then it was stomach cancer. Then it was cancer also in his lymph nodes. Then it was stage 3 gastric adenocarcinoma: extremely uncommon in someone his age. All in a matter of a 10 days.December 21. Steve started chemotherapy.In the past two months I’ve learned a lot about cancer. I’ve learned that cancer is not honest. I’ve learned that it can mutate to look like normal cells, to hide amongst healthy ones. I’ve learned that cancer can live in a person’s blood undetected.  I’ve learned that some people lack a gene that all-but-prevents them from going into remission. I’ve learned that Steve is one of those people. I’ve learned that fighting cancer without the benefit of a fully functioning digestive system is an additional challenge. Most importantly I’ve learned that cancer can’t subside my best friend’s spirit.Steve is my best friend. He has a long path to recovery ahead of him. So many people have reached out with their kind thoughts, prayers, love and words of encouragement. Overwhelming amounts of people have asked if there is anything they can do to help.  I wanted to start this fundraiser to give that opportunity.  Steve has the monumental task of healing ahead of him. I am hopeful that through this fundraiser we can raise enough money to take that burden off him so he can focus all of his good vibes and energy towards his body.Please, if you feel inclined, donate to this fundraiser to help with the ever-growing medical costs that come with the treatment of the miscreant that is cancer. If you are not so inclined, we also accept positive thoughts, prayers, vibes and meditations.Whatever that looks like, help us help Steve beat cancer.",54fb6ded82b157a0c83df08d5a0434cb,65,0.961925,390.0,5,1,general,0,2,1,2,1,0.002328288707799767,0.0011641443538998836,0.7764042507048362,3.1394239830508455,3.166779705205311,gofundme

He was getting his resume and applications out into the world and after a short family vacation, was ready to embark upon the profession he'd worked long and hard to prepare for. Three weeks ago, while heading out on a family celebratory vacation, Mason felt a severe pain in his abdomen and the diagnosis has been a devastating blow. Mason has been diagnosed with a very, very, rare form of cancer, Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT). Sarcoma cancers account for about 1% of all cancers. This specific sarcoma was first documented in 1989, and so far approximately 200 cases have been described in medical literature. Mason is an amazing person, a dedicated fiance, an honorable son, a great brother, a smart and contributing member of his university community, and of course a budding young professional. His education tells him this is a great challenge, but his passion for life and everyone he has touched along the way, will be his strength and support in beating this cancer. Ironically, while at Embry-Riddle, Mason was a volunteer for cancer fund raising. For his abundance of giving, passion for life, incredible friendliness and respect for others, (not to mention his incredibly enviable head of hair) Mason is earned the love and respect of many in return. On Friday June 02, 2017,   Mason Saldana, MS, GSP was the honored recipient of the Arizona Chapter of American Society of Safety Engineers Inaugural Student of the Year Award. This award is in recognition of his continual hard work, leadership and dedication to the chapter throughout the past year. Unfortunately, he was hospitalized in California and not able to attend the ceremony and receive this award in person. As always he was there in spirit. This is Mason, giving it his all to everything in life.  The amount of this Gofundme has been carefully budgeted. There is no excess. This amount is to help him stay near UCLA for the next year. The next 6 months are going to give him a run for his money and that's what we are doing here. Making sure he is in the race. Please feel free to contact us for any financial justification.  We are all in this to help this incredible young man live a long, loving life, in service of others.

For the most part, that's been fine! I've been lucky enough that in that time I'd never come down with anything worse than the occasional cold.Even still, I was really proud of myself for doing the correct, adult thing and getting my own health insurance last year, and apparently in the nick of time: after a few confusing, stressful months -- which I laid out in much greater detail over here -- I was diagnosed with cancer & more or less immediately taken into surgery, where they removed a few feet of my small intestine & a section of my liver.I didn't lie when I first saw the doctors -- why would you? -- and let them know that I'd had some incidences of stomachaches before, but none so serious that I'd been compelled to see a doctor about it until this past summer.And all throughout this time, there were no signs that anything was financially amiss -- I was still asked to pay out-of-pocket for a few doctor visits, but was told that it was because health insurance companies can sometimes wait until the very end of the year to process larger claims (like major surgeries), so that it wouldn't immediately eat through your deductible.It wasn't until early this year that I dug further and realized what was actually happening: Humana had decided at the end of the year to deny all of my claims and left me with a hundred-thousand dollars worth of bills. I immediately started working with the Patient Advocate Network through Livestrong and was assured this was probably a routine, almost clerical, error. Because I'd had no history of medical problems prior to this, the insurance company was obligated to check back through years of history and sniff around for (in my case, non-existant) clinical records to see if I'd gone in for anything related before.It wasn't until a few weeks ago when the formal denial letter came through that the gravity of the situation really hit home: because I hadn't lied when I saw my first doctor -- because I'd told them that I'd had stomachaches at any point in the past five years, whether or not I'd gone to a doctor for it -- I'd fallen under a fine-print pre-existing condition clause that said that any signs of illness that could possibly have led a doctor to a diagnosis since 2008 were cause for denying any compensation for any ailment of pretty much my entire alimentary canal.Patient Advocate took a look at the letter and were super candid: the chances for a successful appeal were basically zero.When I tell people this, their first reaction is always: I don't get it, didn't this just get fixed with the new Health Insurance Marketplace? And it did, and it's maybe the single most important part of the initiative, but it only covers anything from January 2014 on, and I had the misfortune of being self-employed & sick in America in 2013.It's always been extremely hard for me to ask for help from anyone, but outside coming under the patronage of an eccentric billionaire (still working on this, no luck so far), I don't have much recourse left to climb out from under this, and so I started this campaign to help tell my story and ask for some assistance.The silver lining is that I'm still alive & I'm back on my feet & my health is stable for now -- I get regular monthly treatment meant to slow my decline, and my first post-surgery scan came back with essentially good news -- and also that the support I've had throughout all of this has been incredible.That support may include friends & colleagues also coming together outside this campaign to help get me through this, and any additional assistance outside my immediate needs will be put into the cost of that on-going treatment -- as you might expect, from now on, it costs me many, many thousands of dollars more per year just to stay alive. And, you know, this is just the first time I've been dashed against the rocks on my way out to sea. There will come a time, hopefully not too soon, when things will get more serious again, and knowing I've got a bedrock of support is the most important thing in carrying through those tough times, so my thanks to everyone that has, will or can help in any way.",ff052aeb1ed172c8a3a9d05d7dfec46e,9,1.9740272727272727,1770.0,6,1,general,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

His parents were understandably very much against it, so he ran away from home. At the young age he left the comforts and security of his home and went to the Himalayas in his quest for God realization. There he lived at the banks of the Ganges with enlightened yogis. There he was taught Raja-Kriya Yoga. Under their supervision he practiced what was taught to him for seven years. Yogivah Giri Ji is now a Kriya Yoga Master at the enlightened state of Siddha-bhakti Samadhi. This is the final enlightened state of Bhakti Yoga where the heart of the devotee is completely pure, removed from all vasanas, and he is continuously in the state of God consciousness.He earned his living through paintings but now he spends all of his time teaching and guiding people between India and USA, and in spreading Kriya Yoga of Mahavatar Babaji's tradition (which is also propagated by Paramahansa Yogananda all over world). His pure, sincere love, and compassion has won many hearts. Many people from all around the world are now his devout followers. It is said that Saints and birds are the same. Birds never store food in her nest to eat in future. Same way Saints and Sages never accumulate material objects, they live in the present moment. But somehow their needs are always met through the cosmic forces that govern the Universe. The sincere seekers stay with their Guru, constantly supporting and providing for all their necessities. Yogivah Giri Ji is my divine friend, a God-sent Guru, and a spiritual guide. Yogivah Giri Ji can be contacted on facebook at  https://www.facebook.com/yogi.vah/. One may request to be added to his facebook groups where he writes, guides and inspires people on spirituality and Kriya Yoga.The purpose of this fund is to help my dear friend Yogivah Giri Ji to fight his battle against cancer. Yogivah Giri Ji was diagnosed with bladder cancer in June of 2015. On July 9, 2015 he underwent surgery to remove the tumor from his bladder. This was possible through the help of his devoted followers who collected funds for the surgery. Thankfully the surgery was successful. He has now been advised by his doctors to go through BCG treatment to prevent the cancer from recurring. This is a painful treatment, and also financially draining, creating mounting medical bills. The BCG procedure is a long term ongoing treatment. Initially once a week for six weeks, then later once a month for a year, to be continued in reducing frequency for following ten years. The post-operative treatment is expensive and long term. He can't afford to pay the enormous medical bills. I am trying to gather funds for his continued treatment and we need your support.Yogivah Giri Ji's enlightening and uplifting teaching has helped many souls. He says, “If my life is spent in loving and serving people, I will keep on doing till my last breath. My sickness would never be the deterrent”. Though in severe pain and under torturous treatment process, his spirit is still high. He is regularly helping and solving problems of all who approach him even in his most difficult time. My humble request is to kindly support him with this treatment, with whatever amount you are able to donate. Your generous support is very much needed at this time.

The only treatment doctors here recommend is chemotherapy to attempt to shrink or slow down the tumors. Our world has been turned upside down every second since that moment. Carol is my wife and mother of our four wonderful children. She has been beating the odds ever since I met her. We started dating very young and had our first child while she was a freshman at Loyola University Chicago. She went on to graduate and has been teaching in Chicago Public Schools for 13 years. The child of Mexican immigrant parents, she is the first in her family to get a college degree. She is loved by all of her family, friends, coworkers, students and students' parents. She can make anyone feel special because she knows how to care and love unconditionally. Right now, she is in a lot of pain. It has been continuous and progressive since August of this year. She has grown weaker and has taken a leave of absence from work.This newest challenge in our life has reaffirmed our faith in God. It reminded us why we named our first child, ‘Faith’, 18 years ago. We have been praying and asking for a sign or a miracle. We’ve talked about the miracles we have already witnessed. There’s an old Mexican tradition that I watched my dad practice in San Juan de los Lagos, when I was a child. He made a promise to God that we would return every year, if God would make my eyesight better. He would get on his knees and pray the rosary from the entrance of the church and crawl all the way to the altar. It worked; my eyesight improved dramatically as I grew up. Last week, we visited the Shrine of our Lady of Guadalupe in Des Plaines, IL. I got on my knees and prayed the rosary, with all my faith, as I crawled towards the shrine. The next day, my sister happened to show me a photo of a stone with our dad’s name on it that our family recently had dedicated to him. I had no clue that his stone was placed in the ground at the shrine in Des Plaines. I realized that I had crawled right over my dad’s name the night before, performing the same ritual he taught me 35 years ago for someone I love as much as he loved me. It was a sign. The same day, Carol’s cousin texted her the link to Hope 4 Cancer. It is the only place that we’ve found able to CURE the same diagnosis Carol has; another sign. This is the path God has put before us.We are asking for $40,000 to cover expenses for travel, stay and treatment at Hope 4 Cancer Institute (hope4cancer.com ), where Dr. Antonio Jimenez has helped cure many diseases with his groundbreaking approaches and procedures. Since it is in México, our insurance does not cover it. We have researched many clinics around the world, and this seems like the most comprehensive, non-toxic solution for getting our Carol back to good health. We know that chemotherapy only has a 2.7% success rate, and we understand how the US medical field may be compromised by big pharmaceutical corporations, keeping patients on drugs without any interest to truly cure an illness. Please, consider helping us reach our goal as soon as possible. I would like to raise the money by Friday, November 18, 2016. Every second is ticking and every penny will help. Carol is only 37 years old. We have many more happy memories to make with our family and friends for years to come.

It began with a small bump and eventually grew tremendously -- and fast. So much that it had affected his normal eating habits, sleeping habits, and pained him to talk.  After several visits to the doctor and surgery to have it removed, samples of the mass were sent to a lab for further inspection. We were not expecting the results that followed.My Uncle, father of 2 children (Pablo [14] and Ruben [24]), a husband, and a second father to me and my siblings was diagnosed with Stage IV Lymphoma Cancer. As an all-too-common story for many, it was the worst nightmare imaginable and the course of our family's lives was instantly changed. Dario has kept a positive attitude -- he seems to be the most postive out of all of us -- and chose to relentlessly fight back. He was advised to meet with an oncologist and in the following weeks will begin receiving extensive chemotherapy and radiation. My Uncle has an immense support system filled with friends and family constantly offering their help, and that has no monetary value. He has all intentions of beating this, will accept any form of treatment advised to him, but ultimately cancer can quickly drive you to emotional and physical bankruptcy. As a floor installer, his means of making a living requires a physical toll. Because of the aggressive treatment he will be receiving and the pain, he will not be able to work. His job does not have any company benefits, paid time off, or disability meaning that he will be receiving no wages. My Aunt Maria, his wife of 26 years and counting, makes a living off of house maintenance. His oldest son, my cousin Ruben, has a part-time job with the company Apple and is currently working towards an MS in Bioinformatics. While both have already made adjustments and have taken up more shifts, help is still needed -- and a lot of it -- from people like you. And while we are optimistic about his treatment and care (and God-willing, a cure), his greatest concern is the ability to provide for his family while battling this aggressive, and unbelievably costly, cancer. As many know, there is no time to waste with such an aggressive form of cancer. Nobody likes to ask for help, and it isn't easy to admit that this is a reality, but it's really what we need.

Unfortunately, this cancer has spread and Megan is currently receiving chemo.  This rare type that Megan was diagnosed with is not easily treated and Megan will be traveling to Baltimore on March 20th to meet with a team of doctors who specialize in this type of cancer. As you can imagine, Chemo is extremely tough on the body and although Megan has a wonderful support system, she still has to care for her son and continue working through this battle.  Medical bills are piling up and some of her treatment/tests are not covered through her insurance. We are asking for prayers and donations to help offset the financial burden and to possibly alleviate the need to work on the days that are extremely tough for her to move.  We hope that Megan's main focus can be on the fight of her life and her little boy and not the financial struggle that accompanies this illness.  Any amount is appreciated and will make a huge impact on Megan's life.  Those of us who have the privilege of calling her a friend will tell you that she is one of the most generous, dedicated, funny, and truly caring people you will ever know.  Our heartfelt prayer is that she will continue to fight and that God's will is to rid her body of this terrible illness.  It’s time to rally for Megan's fight for her life and well being. It is time to shine some of the love and support back to her that she has given to so many!  We are so blessed for all who are praying and donating, THANK YOU!",b3805ac5710cb432fe6cbfc930c12485,14,0.13176,300.0,6,1,pancreatic cancer,0,3,0,2,0,0.00909090909090909,0.0,0.41642897889332575,3.2225606657843358,0.0,gofundme

 aggressive blood cancer that affects the bone marrow and immune system. Little did we know that this diagnosis would upend our lives and toss us into a roller coaster of treatments, health scares, health triumphs, and in general the unknown.He began chemotherapy treatments shortly after his diagnosis, landing him in the hospital for a whopping 9 weeks. He was afflicted with kidney stones, gout and a tooth infection on top of his cancer. He was released from the hospital the first time after receiving chemo and treatment for those ailments, but was admitted not long after for an emergency gall bladder removal surgery.  A few months later he landed in the ICU for pneumonia and almost died. He received a few more rounds of chemo and started naturopathic remedies including vitamin C infusions and hyperbaric treatments- all out of pocket costs.  His cancer started to trend down but in May of 2018 the cancer returned so he flew down to Hope4Cancer in Mexico to receive targeted treatments.  The doctors could not get ahead of the growth of cancer cells so they cut his stay short, sending him home to the states for an emergency round of chemo (Hope4Cancer does not use high-dose chemotherapy treatments).  His oncology team paired his chemo with a new drug called Mylotarg which is used to target the parent cancer cells. He was in the hospital for 45 days! In September of 2018 we received the news that he was in a technical full remission! During this time, he was advised through his team at SCCA to do a consolidation round of chemo and get a bone marrow transplant. Our dad was adamant about using the transplant as a last resort.  He was fortunate to be accepted into a clinical study that would drastically reduce the chance of a full transplant. He had the consolidation round of chemo at the end of October 2018.  He went in for blood draws on November 19th where 25 vials of blood were drawn to use for testing in preparation of this clinical study.  He then had complications from the last round of drugs and blood draws and spent his Thanksgiving in the hospital. On November 26, 2018, we got the devastating news that his cancer returned with a vengeance to 22% blast cells.Only 2 months had gone by cancer free. That goes to show you just how aggressive this disease truly is.While all of his health complications were raging on, there was more going on behind the scenes outside of his hospital visits and outpatient treatments.  Our parents both lost their jobs.  Our parents lost the entirety of their savings/nest egg.  Our parents were forced to sell their home because medical bills outweighed cost of living. He had to spend his birthday, holidays, and special occasions laying in a hospital bed.  He almost died three times. Our mom became his full time caregiver and spent countless hours shuttling him to appointments, making 911 calls and executive decisions regarding his treatments.  She was appointed as his power of attorney.  Can you imagine how exhausting this is?  We gave up our jobs, friends and independent lives in Colorado to come home to be with our family in their time of need.  Cancer affects the entire family. That brings us to the present (reminder: he is at 22% leukemic cells at this point).  The bone marrow transplant is his last option to get the cancer under control.  The chemo has not stuck.  The clinical trial he was approved for stipulated that he has to be in remission for six months after a relapse so that is no longer an option.  His insurance will only cover a portion of the procedure.  We are asking for donations to cover the transplant and the cost of living.  SCCA provides some housing but the space is limited so our parents may be living out of a hotel (he cannot be more than 15 minutes away from the SCCA campus due to high risk of complications). This experience has been more than traumatic for our family.  We are pleading for donations to get our dad to the finish line with this transplant so he has a fighting chance to beat this disease once and for all.  Remember, you could be one diagnosis away from an experience similar to ours.  Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for taking the time to read this, share our story, and donate.  Please use the hashtag #bonemarrowdinero when sharing to spread awareness about our story.  Let's make this viral! With love,Anja & McKenna<3",04c0bcf32f567c5794a5079e10d2bcad,45,0.1566,30.0,1,1,leukemia,0,1,0,1,0,0.0012422360248447205,0.0,0.9204470742932281,1.7279686718373257,0.0,gofundme

We do and have been shown proof over and over throughout our entire lives. From vivid dreams to answered prayers, God has shown us that He is in control and that He has a plan for our lives. This has never been so true as recent events have led our family down the hardest path we have ever endured. On March 22, 2018, our son Blaze Powell, fell “being a boy” at recess and this simple injury turned into a life changing (life-saving) event.  Blaze was taken to Children’s Hospital/UAB with concerning symptoms from the fall. Within hours, our world was turned upside down after preliminary tests came back showing a mass within his prostate. After additional weeks of testing, labs, surgeries, and scans, the doctors’ suspicions were confirmed that Blaze has  Undifferentiated Sarcoma within his prostate. This rare diagnosis requires additional testing, scans and labs as they are still uncertain of the type of cancer that is growing in his tiny body. They have decided to begin a general chemotherapy routine that consists of 2 different types being administered within 3-4 day stay at Children’s Hospital every 4 weeks. During the second round of chemo, Blaze will also begin to undergo Radiation, with hopes that after 13 weeks, the doctors can go in and remove the tumor, so long as it has not grown. In addition to the hospital treatments, Blaze will undergo injections and medications at home to help with his battle against cancer.  We know this battle will be long and it will be difficult. It will challenge us in ways we have never even imagined. But one thing is certain, we know that God is in control and He will lead Blaze down a path of healing, not only for his body but within his heart and soul! I know that God will lay his hands upon us as we face this battle like only true champions can!   Thank you all for reading this and following Ninja Blaze as he fights the most important battle he has ever fought!  “It’s Not the Size of the Ninja in the Fight, but the Size of Fight inside the Ninja”  #TeamBlazeP",299eabac91cc5a52cbb6ecba108742a2,18,0.36925,270.0,5,1,general,0,8,1,4,1,0.02127659574468085,0.0026595744680851063,0.15392015392015393,13.168070293050265,3.166779705205311,gofundme

She has a wonderful caring wife and a twelve-year-old son who is the “light” of her life. They need your help facing life’s most horrific battle – Glioblastoma brain cancer.Kris is the funniest person I know and makes everyone feel like they matter. She is my lifelong best friend, and I am not the only person who feels this way about her. Like many of her closest friends, I met her working at a music store. She worked in the music business for many years at Sound Warehouse, Record Bar, and Randy’s M&M’s. To say Kris is an avid music and movies fan understates her passion for artists who connect all of us. She loves all kinds of music from Sheryl Crow, Trisha Yearwood, Olivia Newton John to Shelby Lynne, Alison Moorer, Elizabeth Cooke, The Bangles, Amy Grant, Big Star, R&B, and classic country. She and her son love to listen to music together on the way to school and share time watching the kids show Gravity Falls. She loves Turner Classics and all Hitchcock movies. She is known to quote Grease, Clue, Bob’s Burgers, and Laverne and Shirley. Before her surgery she quoted Planet of the Apes “You cut up his brain!” Even facing brain surgery, she made us all laugh.On December 10, 2018, Kris could not move her right arm consistently, then not at all. She went to the emergency room at her community hospital and was immediately routed to Integris in Oklahoma City for emergency brain surgery to remove a tumor from the upper left side of her brain. The doctor was able to remove it, but remnants of the tumor remain, which doctors have diagnosed as Glioblastoma – a rapidly growing and spreading form of brain cancer. Brain surgery alone can run as high as $100, 000. She will have to undergo immediate aggressive cancer treatment and funding to help with this process is of utmost importance.American Brain Tumor Association - Glioblastoma Kris worked as a social worker as an advocate for the elderly at Oklahoma’s Adult Protective Services for four years. She left this job for another outside of social work to make more money. After a year, her new job left her feeling like she was not doing enough for her community, and she decided to go back to help Oklahoma’s ageing indigent population. She was only back in this job for a few months when this cancerous brain tumor forced her into this horrible financial crisis. Because Kris has only been back at Adult Protective Services for a few months, she is ineligible for short-term disability and has limited leave, which makes her need for funds immediate. She has insurance through the first of next year, but she most likely will not be able to continue working. Additionally, her hospital stay, surgery, and physical therapy were all at the end of this year, so her deductible and out of pocket costs begin again immediately in January when she starts her much-needed cancer treatment. Without working she will not be able to meet her mortgage and utilities, not to mention, pay for the insurance she will need for her treatment. Kris’ wife and son depend on her income to live.Please make a donation! Whatever we raise will help, not only financially, but by letting Kris know that there are so many people who care about and love her.",cd5972ba54000cc2e70110f3413b0a72,25,0.6344666666666666,30.0,2,1,brain cancer,0,1,0,1,0,0.0017006802721088435,0.0,0.059093692590324556,1.2225606657843358,0.0,gofundme

What is Ewing's sarcoma?This is one of the rarest types of cancerous tumors that grow in your bones or the soft tissue around your bones, such as cartilage or the nerves. It usually affects people between the ages of 10 to 20.Last year in October, two separate biopsies were done, she was given the devastating news that the mass was...cancer. After receiving her diagnosis, her Oncologist was prepared to start her treatment right away. In November, she started a chemotherapy regiment along with radiation that spanned over the following 6 months.  She was advised that the survival rate for this type of sarcoma was 5%, however, she persevered and beat all odds. She was given time off from her treatment to give her body time to recuperate as it was weak from chemotherapy.  Over that short period, she slowly lost feeling in her legs. She was rushed to the hospital where they found cancer cells pressing on her spinal cord.  An emergency spinal surgery was scheduled and performed as she would've been paralyzed without it.  Following the procedure, Renisa was sent to a rehab facility to help her regain mobility. While receiving her therapy treatment, the doctors overseeing her ordered an MRI and CT scan for the head, abdomen, and torso. The results were devastating...  Not only did she have a sinus infection which caused constant headaches, also a new tumor is pressing on the cervical region of the spinal cord. This caused semi-paralysis in the upper portion of her left arm. She was rushed back to the hospital as her symptoms are getting worse. Her oncologist recommended her to be put on Chemotherapy in the pill form and also a few sessions of radiation.Since her diagnosis, her family has been there for her physically, emotionally and also financially. Even with insurance, medical bills have been a financial burden. Her family has been stuck wondering ""How do you get help with medical expenses that aren’t covered?"" After Renisa received her diagnosis in October, she was told she would have 8 months to a year to live. Then at a follow up in December she was told a few months. In her most recent meeting, her Oncologist's nurse told her a few days to a week to live. Her family doesn't believe that! Renisa is a fighter and she won't let this cancer kill her. She has always been the selfless type that would give you the shirt off her back, who puts everyone in front of her. She was reluctant to even have this page set up for her as she would rather give than receive. However, she wants to get a second opinion but insurance only covers so much. There are a lot of companies out there that offer treatment but don't accept the health insurance that she currently has. Every day is a constant fight, Renisa wants to live more than anything in this world. She wants to beat cancer and be rid of it for good. There have been times where she feels to give up but is reminded that she has so much to live for. Family, friends and many loved ones who would love to see her live a long, healthy and prosperous life.  Never in a million years would Renisa or her family think they would need help but every does at some point. This page was created not only to raise funds to help with Renisa's medical bills, her living expenses and also any additional treatment. She has been unable to work since being diagnosed, so she isn't financially able to do much. They appreciate any amount of gifts you are able to extend to Renisa as she moves from this difficult time toward a full recovery, they ask for your generosity, your prayers, and good wishes.",9e9adbb73d7857dd88dc4d2c3b89acde,35,0.3711,540.0,3,1,general,0,2,0,2,0,0.0029585798816568047,0.0,0.77092866756393,2.727968671837326,0.0,gofundme

This sudden news and ominous prognosis has shaken the Job family to the core, but as head, Dr. Job continues to be optimistic and brave as he now fights a daily battle to live. 

When Job learned of his diagnosis he quoted the following verse from Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar: 
“Cowards die many times before their deaths. 
The valiant never taste of death but once. 
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, 
It seems to me most strange that men should fear, 
Seeing that death, a necessary end, 
Will come when it will come.” 

Dr. Job often says that he never used his voice to promote himself or to earn a lot of money. He spent much of his life trying to change the culture of Trinidad and Tobago, educating and uplifting the minds of his fellow citizens. As a result, his illness has placed a great financial burden on his family. 

We are setting up this account in hopes that all who have been touched and inspired by him; family, friends, colleagues, peers, elders, good samaritans near and far, can help us mitigate the financial burden incurred by Dr. Job’s illness. At this time the family desperately needs funds to assist in the purchase of medications, as well as to cover his doctors’ appointments, travel, and 24x7 caregiving expenses. 

No amount is too small and any sum you are able to contribute will be a blessing. Copies of his book “Think Again” and his shorter writings such as ""Police Reform and Performance Management: Crime, The Derby Report and History"" are also available for purchase. For enquiries about these and other writings, for those who wish to do more than make a donation, please contact his daughter Dzifa Job at dzifanjob@gmail.com.

We’ve all have been asking ourselves why her, how could this happen…she’s a perfectly healthy, 38 year old woman, who’s never smoked, with everything anyone could hope or ask for in life: a wonderful husband of 10 years, 3 beautiful daughters, and an amazing family and group of friends. What makes this situation even more difficult is that she’s 32 weeks pregnant with their fourth daughter.Here’s her story from my perspective…On December 13th, Mike and I received a phone call from Barbara (Ro’s mom) thinking she was calling to tease us about our Christmas card, but her tone was somber and serious, and what she was about to share with us caught us completely off guard. For the past week, Rochelle had apparently been suffering from a flu, thinking it was just a cold and would pass. However, the night after she thought it passed, she was awoken with an overwhelming headache and disorientation, causing her to be unable to take care of her three daughters, Azylnn (8), Mila (6), and Nyelli (2) while her husband Miguel was at work - Miguel has been an Albuquerque fireman for 12 years. Miguel immediately rushed home and decided to have her transported to Presbyterian Hospital as a precaution to make sure everything was okay with her and the baby. This is when life decided to throw a curveball - after some tests and an MRI, the doctors discovered a mass in her brain.No one can prepare you for a phone call like that…there were still so many questions to be answered. Mike and I looked at each other, each knowing that all we could do was hope and pray this was a false alarm…maybe a benign tumor, an error on behalf of the machine, who knows. What complicated the situation even further was the pregnancy, there’s only so many tests and diagnostics that can be preformed so as not to harm the unborn baby, and so we waited. Each day after that Tuesday brought only a couple more answers, the mass in her head was relatively small - around 1cm - which was good news and the doctors were able to do a biopsy. The results of the biopsy revealed that the mass was an abnormality and also led doctors to believe that the brain tumor could possibly be a byproduct of something else going on in her body. Mike called me on Friday December 16th, a phone call I’ll never forget, in tears blurting out that Rochelle had stage IV lung cancer……our worst fears had been confirmed.The next couple days were a whirlwind - that night Mike and his dad, Big Mike, immediately left for Albuquerque and I followed the next day - all we wanted to do was be with her and family. By the time I arrived at their home it was 3am, Rochelle had come home from the hospital and everyone was asleep. I can tell you from this experience that there’s no script or dialogue to follow when you find out someone has cancer, there’s no wrong or right thing to say, sometimes you’re just speechless, as most of us were in this case. When I saw her first thing that next morning, I just crawled into bed with her and we hugged and cried.That following week was filled with doctors appointments which continued all the way up to Christmas day. There were so many questions to be answered, but what we did know was that the baby was healthy and that they were able to schedule a lung biopsy for that week with the results coming in Tuesday after Christmas.So what did we do in the anticipation of results and answers, we came together as a family! My parents, Kathleen and Austin, drove out from LA, Celine (Ro’s sister) and her boyfriend, Ryan, flew in from Santa Cruz, and between all of us, including Miguel’s parents, John and Carmen, and of course Barbara, we helped in any way that we could. There was an outpouring of love and support from even more family and friends via phone calls, Facebook messages, text messages, care packages, and more. I’ve never seen a group come together so quickly as the Albuquerque Fire Department did to shower this family with love and labor, and lots and lots of food; these men were delivering food and Costco supplies around the clock! We spent Christmas Day in Santa Fe with Rosie and Carmelo (Ro’s grandparents), which was probably one of the most special Christmas’s we had ever had - all of us embracing each other with love and lots of prayers.Tuesday eventually came and we had another piece of the puzzle, the diagnosis. The doctors informed Rochelle that she had been diagnosed with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK ) Fusion Oncogene Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. It’s categorized as stage IV because the cancer has metastasized to her brain creating a small secondary tumor. Almost 40% of lung cancer patients have no symptoms until it has traveled to other parts of the body. As of now, there’s no trace of cancer in her blood, bones, liver, and adrenal glands, which are additional common places it can spread when you have lung cancer. I’m sure you’re wondering, but, once again, she’s never smoked. Unfortunately, 15%-20% of lung cancer patients are nonsmokers and the causes can range anywhere from occupational to environmental, and as of today, we do not know the cause. Apparently, lung cancer research has come a long way in the last 4-5 years, and there are new treatments being tested and discovered all the time. As for Rochelle, the current plan to treat the lung cancer is an oral drug called Alectinib and to address the mass in her brain they’ll perform Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS ). The doctors explained that this specific type of lung cancer is slower growing, so they feel confident delivering the baby at 36 weeks. As to how to ultimately deliver the baby, the doctors are still determining which delivery method will be the safest for both mom and baby, c-section or a natural vaginal birth.As we stand today, the overall prognosis for Rochelle is that her cancer is not curable, but TREATABLE with the goal being long term survivability. Many people have reached out asking how they can help and we’re hoping this Go Fund Me page will be part of the answer. The Tittmann Family has a long journey and fight ahead of them, and with the funds we raise here we hope to alleviate some of the financial burdens that come with a cancer diagnosis. Rochelle is an amazing stay-at-home mom and varsity volleyball coach for a local high school, and while she makes her health her number one priority, Miguel will be taking time off work to care for a newborn, their daughters, and support a recovering and healing wife. The ultimate goal is to help raise funds for their medical and household expenses, which they'll accrue during her treatments, in the hope that all Rochelle will have to do is focus on healing and ultimately knowing that this is one less thing she needs to worry about for her family.With that said, the new year is a time for reflection, change, and new beginnings, and a good reminder that we have so much to be thankful for each and every day of our lives.  No donation is too small!!  Please stay tuned for more information, stories, where your donations are going, and the long road ahead.  With your assistance we can all work together to help Rochelle in this time of need!Love you Ro,Sloane aka Soon-To-Be-Sister-In-Law#TeamRoBaby - Please visit her Facebook page for more info :)Azlynn (8), Miguel, Nyelli (2), Mila (6), RochelleSanta Fe Christmas 2016 from Left to Right, Back Row to Front Row:Miguel, NyelliTerri, Daniel, Big Mike, Rochelle, Barbara, Mike, Carmelo, Austin, RyanElizabeth, Sloane, Mila, Azylnn, Rosie, Kathleen, Celine",0d2c4105747931b630cde4a90eb12695,37,0.73937,750.0,3,1,mixed,0,1,1,1,1,0.0007220216606498195,0.0007220216606498195,0.808355091383812,1.0,1.0,gofundme

My name is Rose, and my family and I are asking you to please help save my brother John's life. John is 35 years old and is currently battling an aggressive, life-threatening brain tumor called a glioblastoma (GBM). The average prognosis for a GBM patient is 12-15 months. There is no standard treatment for recurrent brain cancer and this presents both a financial and medical challenge. John’s current treatment plan includes Avastin and Keytruda infusions, but these treatments are not curative, so we have been tirelessly searching for more options. Through outreach to many doctors and foundations, John has been offered an opportunity to participate in a new alternative treatment that is not covered by insurance. Please help John in his battle with brain cancer!In 2012, John was a typical 29 year-old living in Chicago, building a successful career, and engaged to the love of his life, Allyson. One day at work, John was in a meeting and very abruptly started seizing and was rushed to the emergency room. Everything changed for John and our family that day. John was diagnosed with an anaplastic astrocytoma, a type of brain cancer. He underwent an awake craniotomy which removed 60-70% of the brain tumor. Immediately after surgery, John started radiation, chemo, and adopted lifestyle changes which doctors and researchers thought would be helpful.(Here is John after his first surgery with his neurosurgeon, Dr. Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa (Dr.Q),  in 2012)From 2013 to 2017, the conventional treatments helped stabilize John’s tumor and John and Allyson started a family by welcoming first Dennis (now almost 4 years old) and then Matthew (now 1 year old). John continued to work, but also committed himself to encouraging others fighting for their lives through the Livestrong Foundation. He has spoken at and participated in numerous Livestrong events to help inspire others, all while continuing his own fight. (John, Allyson, Dennis (3), Matthew (1))Last May (’17), just a few weeks after Matthew was born, John went in for a routine MRI that produced devastating news; the tumor suddenly showed significant growth. This time the tumor was so aggressive that he started losing some of his vision and speech. In January (’18), John underwent his second awake craniotomy which was more invasive and painful than the first. The initial news was promising as Dr.Q and his team were able to get almost 90% of the tumor.(John in the ER on Christmas Eve 2017- always smiling!)However, the pathology results came back with the worst news to date- John’s recurrence was now a GBM. A month post-surgery the tumor had grown back to its original size, and a new tumor was found shortly after.  Despite all of this, John continues to be the most positive, empathetic and loving person you will ever meet. I think anyone who knows him agrees that he has a smile that is uplifting and a demeanor that can change the entire tone in a room. John is a fighter and he is determined not to lose this battle!

(Watch this video of John featured on the news as he was biking across Iowa at Ragbrai 2015. He talks about overcoming obstacles and staying positive!)This is where we need your help. John has serious vision and speech impairments which have ended his ability to work. Through outreach to many doctors and the foundations working to cure brain cancer, John has been offered a promising opportunity to participate in a new alternative treatment. Unfortunately, the treatment is not covered by insurance. The cost for this treatment is substantial, around $100,000, and the need to start is urgent! To date, John and Allyson have paid for all medical costs in excess of insurance, but this is more than our family can handle. Please know that we would not ask for this help if we did not feel it was completely necessary. By donating to this cause, you are helping my brother get the treatment he needs to keep fighting! Additionally, your donations will enable doctors to pursue these leading edge treatments in research that potentially could save others from this horrible disease. Any funds raised that do not go towards treatment will be put towards providing John’s young boys a secure future.Thank you in advance for all your love and support!(Family with Santa!

Finally, In May 2015, she underwent Mastectomy and multiple lymph nodes were removed as well.However, due to delays in surgery, her cancer had progressed to other organs. She started feeling unexplained sharp pains in her spine. She couldn’t even get out of the bed and move. The scans in June 2015 showed that the Cancer had spread to her spine, Lungs and Liver. The cancer had spread so quickly that her right lung was completely compromised in a few days. It is such a rare and aggressive form of cancer that her size of the tumor increased from 1 cm to 11.6 cm in her liver within a month. She is currently put on a 24 hr Oxygen support. She has been re-staged to a stage IV cancer. She asked her Oncologist, “how much time she has? Will she be able to see her kids grow up?” The Oncologist had a look on his face and told her that the next five weeks are very critical! She was in tears… A week later she found a glimmer of hope when she learned about the new treatment which has been approved in USA but not in Canada. Her Oncologist in Canada is also in agreement with the treatment. But there is a huddle…The cost of her treatment in US is approx. $250,000.

Monday  October 16th she started radiation and was to start chemo on the 23rd but was admitted into the hospital on the 21st and has been there ever since.  She was well enough to only receive one treatment of chemo and as of now, has gone through two blood transfusions and the next treatment of chemo is on hold until she’s strong enough. It’s been a day to day constant battle to keep her spirits and all around well being, positive. Although she has medical insurance, she’s still faced with a ton of hospital bills, treatment-related bills and everyday expenses such as rent, utilities, etc. She has only been at her job just short of a year so she only qualified for short term disability which is still only 60% of her normal income. Her daughter Carly has become her full time caretaker making it hard for her to work so I figured I would start this fund to help Carly pay for her mom's bills so she can focus on fighting this cancer! Sally is always there to give her constant love and support to anyone in need so now it’s our opportunity to return that love and support to her.  Anything you can donate will be truly appreciated.  Please spread the word and keep her in your prayers.

She is a  mother of 4 children. Brayden (7) Nonah (5) Charlee (4) Ezra (3)She has had to suddenly stop working  after finding out the severity of her illness to focus on herself, her health and her family. Not only is this devastating in general, It is also Christmas adding to the devastation and heartache she is already enduring.This is her Story... On Novemeber 8th I under went a sinus surgery to remove what was thought to be a polyp, surgery was a success and I was sent home to recover. On November 16th I went in for what I thought was a typical post op appointment. It was then I was informed my biopsy came back as squamous cell carcinoma, a cancer that left untreated would be hard to treat but all around an easy to treat cancer. I was informed my biopsy was sent to Mayo Clinic for confirmation and to collect more information on the exact type of cancer. The 2 week wait was the longest wait of my life.On November 27th I went in to meet with my Oncologist to discuss Mayo Clinics findings and to get a plan to kick this cancers butt!!! It was then that I was informed that the type of cancer that I have is called NUT MIDLINE CARCINOMA, A very rare, very aggressive and very hard to treat form of cancer with a very low survival rate. I was told the tumor was in my head and extends to the roof of my mouth. I would first need to see if this is operable and then would need to go for very intense immediate treatment. Due to the type of cancer and its rarity I was referred to Froedert to meet the Oncology Team.On November 28th I went to Milwaukee to meet with what felt like millions of Doctors, had things shoved in my nose and a lot of reviewing my prior scans BUT mostly a lot of reassuring words. I met the team of Doctors that will help rid me of this cancer.. I have yet to have my pet scan, MRI or CT scan since my prior surgery so with that being said it is very hard to determine what my treatment plan will be until we figure out how much of the Tumor is left inside of me. As many people know, Insurance is a tricky thing so we now have to wait to schedule all of these things until we get prior authorization from my insurance. While I wait they are keeping me comfortable. Friends, Family and Strangers I ask you all to Pray, Pray it hasn't spread, Pray she can have one more surgery and follow it up with radiation and that she can be done with this devastating chapter. Pray for her Children as they watch their mother put up the fight of her life for them.  Pray for Alex as he watches the love of his life take on this battle. Pray for her family, her parents and everyone that is affected by all of this.

For those of you that do not know over the last few months Curt had been experiencing excruciating back pain keeping him from normal every day function and activity. He has spent the majority of his time in the hospital over the last month. On June 22nd we were blind-sided with devastating news as he was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma. Multiple Myeloma is a hematological (blood) cancer that develops in the plasma cells found in the bone marrow.  It is a very debilitating condition, and 9 rounds of radiation and pain medications have not even begun to touch the pain he is experiencing. Curt was discharged from Genesys hospital Wednesday July 5th and sent home with heavy pain medications to try and manage the pain. Those prescribed medications nearly killed him and Friday morning July 8th during a second opinion consult at U of M Hospital in Ann Arbor he was immediately sent to ER for an unintentional overdose where he was placed on a Narcan IV drip for opioid reversal. It was a very scary 48 hours to say the least. Doctors  are now trying to best figure out a way for him to be at home and manage his pain prior to his treatment plan.Unfortunately, because of Curt’s condition he will be unable to work and someone will need to be with him at all times to help him get around until we can get him well again.  We are desperate at this point to find him pain relief and will do whatever it takes to help him.  As we all know chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, and other life-saving treatments are both difficult and costly.  We have the fight of our lives on our hands right now and Curt will need all the help he can get with medical bills, experimental drugs, alternative treatments, travel expenses etc. It has been very difficult to watch him in such horrific pain and not be able to do anything to help. So many of you have reached out asking how you can help this wonderful man, outside of your prayers. Our road ahead is long but we will pray, stay focused and remain positive that Curt will be well again. Supporting him with whatever you can give to help relieve the financial burden would be greatly appreciated, even if it's just a prayer or a share. With financial assistance, our family can focus on getting him healthy and strong.We truly appreciate all the prayers, love and support from all our family and friends that have reached out to us over the last month. Thank you! We are beyond blessed to have you all in our lives. Please keep Curt and our family in your prayers.God Bless you all!Curt, Erika, Gavin & Nolan",ab8917ab92f46c6605c0a4dc9a6b442d,21,0.7548666666666667,540.0,6,1,general,0,1,0,1,0,0.0019880715705765406,0.0,0.6355344764684422,1.0,0.0,gofundme

Two days ago, Mimi was diagnosed with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL). ALL is a cancer that starts from the early version of white blood cells called lymphocytes in the bone marrow. The term “acute” means that the leukemia can progress quickly, and if not treated, would probably be fatal within a few months. Fortunately for Mimi, the cancer was detected within a few weeks of her feeling symptoms like extreme fatigue, leg cramps, loss of appetite and overall weakness. She was admitted into the hospital under the impression that she is anemic, and after a painful process of extracing blood cells from her bone marrow, the doctors at UCLA Research Center came back with different results. Mimi woke up with a confirmation of what she [being the smart nursing student that she is] knew was the case - she had cancer. Like any cancer, the process is long, tiring, painful, emotional, scary, crazy, overwhelming, exhausting, unpredictable, shocking and a number of other things no one can prepare themselves for. And cancer is also very, very expensive. Mimi will be at the UCLA Research Center for a month, receiving a number of expensive drugs and procedures, including chemotherapy (she was a total trooper through her first session – the most painful one. Go Mimi!) The best thing we can hope for is that she goes into remission and never comes out. But if she does come out, she is going to need a stem cell transplant (from her little hero brother Dylan). We pray that's not the outcome, but we also want to be prepared for the worst – mentally, physically, spiritually, and of course financially. Anyone can imagine the suffering of two parents not being able to take their child's pain and troubles away, not being able to trade places for the sake of their child's well-being, and not being able to predict what's coming next. But they are strong and remain positive, hopeful, supportive, and right by Mimi's bedside everyday. This also means not going into work for quite some time and unfortunately, you don't get a pass from your monthly bills, daily living expenses, or the medical bills to come after she beats(!) this awful disease. This is where we come in!Cancer is not contagious, but our fighting spirit is.Please join our family and friends in this battle for Mimi to overcome ALL. Whatever dollar amount you can contribute, be it $1 or $10, will greatly help the Gasparyan family through this difficult time. If you're unable to donate, we just as much appreciate you sharing this with your friends and social media followers, keeping Mimi in your prayers, sending positive vibes out into the universe, or simply wearing a bit more orange today – it all counts. Our wonderful friends and supporters at Polkatots Cupcakes are helping us thank our generous contributors. Through the rewards program, any $100 donations will receive one (1) free cupcake from the Pasadena-based bakery – redeemable at any time.

My mom, Lisa was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. She’s now completed for second for six rounds of chemotherapy which will be followed by her surgery, five weeks of radiation, and then six more months of chemo to follow.It’s all so surreal. You hear about people and families affected by cancer and subconsciously, you never think it’s going to happen to you or your family... until it does.For those of you that know my mom, know that my sister Kristy and I are all the family here that she has. We are a tight knit trio of women who have truly been through hell and back together. For those of you who know Lisa, know that she was the entire neighborhoods second mother and that she lived for us kids growing up. She gave her life, energy, money, and time to us day in and day out because she genuinely enjoyed it. Shes been a pillar in every school and every community she’s ever been a part of. Between the franklin park park district, to school trips and the music departments, from the PTA to being a devoted dance and softball mom, our schedules were her schedule. She has a heart of gold and has really gone through some things in her life that no one should ever have to go through. And just when you think you’ve hit bottom and are trying to get back up... you hear the word cancer and your name in the same sentence. No one deserves the amount of stress this puts on a body, much less a woman in her late 50s who is waiting tables and rebuilding her life brick by brick.We are prideful and stubborn German women, so by nature we don’t ask for help- ever.But this time is different. This time my moms life is at stake... and we’re going to need some help. It’s extremely expensive to be sick in this country now-a-days and the bills are going to start coming in full force. My sister and I are working twice as much now and filling our schedules with anything that’ll pay, but we know that it won’t be enough. And in my opinion, in order to really give this fight everything she’s got, she needs to only work when her body will allow and shouldnt have to have the stress of bills on her shoulders on top of it all.I’m asking my friends, family, acquaintances, and colleagues: please help if you can. No donation is too small, and I’ll never be able to thank everyone enough for all the outpouring of love we’ve gotten so far. My mom has worked her entire life to help make mine and my sisters dreams come true, and her dream is to be able to meet her grandkids one day. We need our mom and they’re going to need their grandma. If you can, please join me in helping my mom win this thing!

He saw a few doctors but they all said he was fine. Recently, he went to have a scan done of his nasal cavity and the scan showed a block so they performed surgery to remove it. After removing the blockage, a biopsy was then done.  A few days later, the results came in. My 19 year old brother was diagnosed with a very rare  (only 17 cases ever recorded) form of cancer, Sinonasal carcinoma, a newly described sinonsal tumor type that is characterized by a total absence of SMARCBI expression. Experience is limited with this tumor type. Many, but not all have behaved aggressively. After receiving the results from the nasal biopsy, a brain scan was done to be sure the cancer hadn't spread. Unfortunately, the Scan showed a tumor in the brain. Conner will be flying to Houston August 28, 2016 and staying at MD Anderson Cancer Institute for treatment, which includes surgery to remove the tumor from the brain, radiation, and possibly chemotherapy.  The reason I have created this page is because Conner has had to take a leave of absence from his job at the Naples Bay Resort and the health insurance Conner has, will only pay if treatment is completed in Naples/Fort Myers.

Por 7 años , ella a estado batallando con un dolor en su abdomen y vientre. Por esos 7 años, ella entraba y salía del hospital esperando que le dieran respuestas el porque tenía tanto dolor. Fueron varias veces que fue rechazada y mandada a su casa con medicamentos que paraban el dolor por un rato pero no tenía respuestas de el porque.  En Mayo 6,2018 fue la primera vez que por fin tuvo una respuesta que cambió todo por completo.

Su dolor fue demasiado fuerte que espero que su familia se durmiera para no preocupar a nadie. Se fue al hospital sola para recibir la lamentable noticia que pudiera tener cancer. Después de varios exámenes de sangre y incluyendo un CT , el CT resulto con tumores en su abdomen bajo. Alas 2 am siguiendo sola , recivio la terrible noticia que probablemente era cancer. Fue admitida al hospital para continuar con los exámenes y asegurar que si era cancer. Rodiada por su familia esperando anciosamente por los resultados y con fe, fue translada a un hospital en donde aceptaban su aseguranza. El hospital a donde fue transladada, repitieron los examenes y una biopsia. Desafortunadamente recibimos la lamentable noticia de que si era cancer. Pero el tipo de cancer todavia no estaba confirmado. Unos días despues , regresó al hospital para un procedimiento que pudiera contestar nuestras preguntas sobre el cancer. Cuando el Dr. hablo con nosotros , nos aseguro que iba estar bien , siguiendo el plan de tratamiento incluyendo las Quimioterapias. Nos confirmó que teníe cancer de ovarios etapa 3C que no tan solo abia avansado y fue detectado antes de que llegara a sus pulmones causando que fuera etapa 4. Desde que comenzó las quimoterapias sus tumores han encogido y aseguran que el quimo está funcionando. Cuando finalmente todo iva bien , ella se encontro en el hospital nuevamente por una fuerte tos. Después de varios exámenes, le confirmaron que tenía pneumonia. Gracias a dios después de antibióticos está bien. Desafortunadamente nos queda una larga batalla para estar bien! Tendrá una cirugia y le quedan unas sesiones de quimioterapias, pero gracias a dios estamos muy agradecidos y afortunados de tenerla aun  con nosotros. Como ustedes se pueden imaginar , luchar contra el cancer es muy costoso. Desde que fue diagnosticada con cancer no pudo trabajar y su aseguranza sólo cubre sierto porcentaje del tratamiento. Se les agradece de todo el corazón si nos pudieran ayudar, estaríamos muy agradecidos con que compartan este link. Hoy por nosotros mañana por ustedes.

English:  Hello friends and family we know asking for help is never easy and we wish we didn't have too. But the fact of the reality is that we do need help for our mother. Liduvina is a daughter, sister, wife, mother, grandmother, and an aunt. No matter what she is, she is loved. She raised six kids, who have given her nine grandchildren. Her grandchildren are her world, and showers them with unconditional love. She is also the aunt to many nieces and nephews who she shows that same love. Her family truly is the most important thing to her, and we are all grateful to still have her. For the past seven years she has been having pain in her lower abdomen. Through those seven she has gone to the hosptial several times and left with no answer to what was causing the pain. Too often she was turned away with little to no test performed, pain pills were prescribed and she was sent home. Seven years her pain and concerns were neglected. May 6th, 2018 she got her first real set of answers. Her pain was so bad, she waited for her family to go to bed, so she could drive herself to the hosptial. she didn't want anyone to know she was in pain, so they would not worry about her. Alone in the hosptial she went through a series of test including a CT scan. The CT scan showed some masses in her lower abdomen. At 2AM still all alone, she was told that she may have cancer. She was admitted to the hosptial for further testing. Surrounded by her family we anxiously awaited for the test results only to be told they don't know what is wrong and she needed to be transferred to a different hospital that accepts her insurance. The new hospital repeated some of the same test and performed a biopsy. She was told she did indeed have cancer but the stage and form were uncertain. A few days later she went back to the hosptial for a surgery that would allow doctors to insert cameras inside her abdomen to see where the cancer was and what stage. She was in surgery for hours with her family waiting in a room for the doctor to call. The doctor called and informed us the surgery was succesfull, but he would have to come speak with us. She was diagnosed with Stage 3c ovarian cancer. Not only had her cancer spread, the cancer was caught just before it spread to her lungs, which would have turned the cancer into stage 4. Her doctor developed a treatment plan starting with chemo the following week. Since then she has gone through four rounds of chemo, and another CT scan. The CT scan showed her tumors are shrinking and the chemo is working. Once everything started looking up, she found herself in the hospital yet again due to a bad cough. She had test ran and was told she has pneumonia. Luckily after some antibiotics she will be okay. She still has long road ahead of her. She needs another surgery and an unknown amount of chemo. It is by the grace of God she is still her with us. As you can imagine fighting cancer is expensive. Since being diagnosed with cancer, she has been unable to return to work. She does have insurance, but it does not cover much, so she is left with the burden of trying to figure out how to pay for her hospital bills. Anything you can give is appreciated, even if it just a share.",d93ec11844f602d145612c23fb7c7fea,72,0.09583333333333334,150.0,2,1,general,0,1,0,1,0,0.00089126559714795,0.0,0.9507209633972429,1.4114553112135197,0.0,gofundme

I am a family friend of Leigh White & Mr. & Mrs. Rufus Boutwell. Leigh’s son, Tyler McMahon (19YOA), was recently diagnosed with throat cancer. Tyler is a young man and supporting a family of his own, a one year old daughter- Anslee and girlfriend- Kylee. No one ever, at any point in their life, has time for cancer. Tyler is no exception. Tyler’s mother, Leigh, is a superior mother and would give anyone the shirt off of her back with no questions asked. I took the initiative to start this fund to hopefully take some burden off of this family, both financially and emotionally. Please read below words from Leigh White:“Thank you all SO very much. Armand and I have received numerous visits, calls, and texts with prayers and questions about Tyler and his shocking diagnosis. At the beginning of 2017 Tyler mentioned he had a sore throat. I’m not one to rush to the doctors office every time, so I passed it off. I mean really, a sore throat? I offered Tylenol, Motrin and cough drops and told him it would get better. He complained again, and again. As time passed, mid-year, he began to complain of an earache and jaw pain. I thought back and remembered the excruciating pain I felt when my wisdom teeth needed to be surgically removed. I mentioned to him it may be a possibility but again he shrugged it off. And looking back, I guess we all did. The pain started changing and he started feeling like something was in his throat, a little tickle. When you have a 19 year old (male) let me express how difficult it is to get them to do anything and especially to seek medical attention. You can not make them go to the doctor. You can’t pick them up and take them like you would a two-year-old or even a nine-year-old. Kylee, Tyler’s girlfriend, expressed her concern and that she also thought he needed to be seen. But honestly, everyone passed it off...again. In November, Tyler’s pain worsened, he felt like he had a lingering case of strep and once again I asked him to make an appointment. I begged. During Thanksgiving Tyler showed everyone a “growth” in the very back of his mouth and being the google generation we googled our findings. Could it be his tonsils growing back? His adenoids? Maybe an abscess? I distinctively remember saying “Dad (Armand) works very hard to supply you with the best Medical Insurance, so please use it!” Over the next few days his pain worsened and he began have trouble swallowing. Tyler finally called and made himself an appointment with our longtime, family physician. When he told me of his appointment and that he actually called himself, I felt anxious. I was worried. December 22, 2017 he was seen by PA Lisa Plock and she immediately referred him to an ENT because she had “never seen anything like that before”. Christmas passed, New Years and Tyler was seen in the office of ENT Dr. David Walters on Tuesday, January 9, 2018. Dr. Walters scoped Tyler through his nose and down his throat. He was able to see the “growth” clearly and Tyler was very specific as to where the excruciating pain was. Dr. Walters scheduled Tyler for a CT and biopsy the following week and sent us on our way. The next morning (Jan. 10) Tyler called me at sunrise and said he needed to go to the ER, his pain was no longer tolerable. I called Dr. Walters office, left a message and immediately Dr. Walters himself called me back. He said he was VERY concerned and didn’t want to wait a week for the CT “just in case something is really wrong”. He said he was directly admitting Tyler into St. Francis Hospital, immediately doing a CT and performing the biopsy the next morning after IV antibiotics. After surgery January 11, Dr. Walters came into the waiting room to discuss his findings. When I saw his face, I knew. Armand calls me “NegativeNancey” but a Mama just knows. The pathologist on site couldn’t confirm or deny his findings so the “snippets“ were being sent off and would be back in 3-5 business days. Dr. Walters was upbeat, positive and he was realistic. I’ve been around numerous doctors in my life and being the sole caregiver of my 88 year old grandmother we see lots of doctors but Dr. Walters is by far the best. He is compassionate, understanding and has literally sat with my son and I for hours, talking and explaining in detail, attempting to lesson our fears and anxiety. He assured me if we acted quicker, not “passed it off it” like we did, the outcome would’ve most likely been rounds of antibiotics and the “C” not found until now. The next 6 days crept like a snail crossing the Sahara. Thursday (January 18) at 12:54pm Tonya called from Dr. Walter’s office. The results were in but we needed to come into the office to discuss them. “Anytime there is bad news you go in” and “if it was good news you’d say so”, I told her. She apologized as I cried. Yesterday morning we were told “Low Grade Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma”, our otherwise healthy, 19 year old (20 in April) son, has throat cancer. This Tuesday, January 23, Tyler will be assessed by Dr. Mihir R. Patel at Emory in Atlanta, Georgia and his surgery date will be confirmed. With God’s help, ALL cancer will be robotically removed from our child’s body and Tyler will be a walking testimony to our Lord. Please continue your prayers. We feel them and they feel good.”This GFM was created to assist Tyler with medical bills for treatments as well as living costs for himself and his family as he is the primary provider in his home.

She was diagnosed with breast cancer 7 years ago at the age of 40 years old. After doing many rounds of chemotherapy and radiation she had a double mastectomy to help reduce the chances of the cancer ever coming back. However, just over 2 years ago her mother passed away unexpectedly and tragically after having been ill herself for many years. In the midst of all this stress her worst fears had become reality again as the cancer returned even more aggressively and had metastasized to her major organs and bones. The impact of this news has been devastating to her family especially to her 2 young children who have known nothing in their short lives but knowing their dearest mom has cancer. They live in daily fear about her illness. She again began traditional chemotherapy and radiation in Canada but also to explore alternative cancer treatments in other countries as she was not getting any better. In January of 2018 she went to a world-renowned clinic in Mexico and spent 21 days there receiving treatments which started working well and she was feeling a lot better and stronger after that. Before going down to Mexico she could not even walk a few steps to the mailbox without feeling exhausted. After that initial treatment, she was walking briskly around the block. However this treatment requires constant trips to continue the healing and so she made an additional 3 trips there last year receiving treatments that are not offered in Canada. So not only has she been spending precious time away from her young family but they have spent tens of thousands of dollars doing everything they can to get Soula to beat this disease. Unfortunately, OHIP and medical aid do not cover any costs for these crucial treatments. She will now need to go back to a hospital in Mexico where she will need to stay for a month to receive innovative treatments for 6 hrs a day 7 days a week including a stem cell bone marrow transplant which is not offered as a treatment regimen in Canada for breast cancer. This will cost them another $55,000 CDN but as you can see they want to do everything they possibly can to keep their loving mother and wife alive and well for as long as they can.This disease has been a tremendous financial and emotional burden on this family and I reach out to all to help Soula get the necessary medical treatment to help her in her battle to defeat this dreadful disease.

She is suffering from the rare condition of Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( Tongue Cancer). The condition was diagnosed a month ago, right now is in a stage 2 and needs surgery immediately. She's in much need of funds to cover the surgery tha involves the removal of cancer tissue and reconstruction of the tongue which is expensive. The recovery requires her to be, at least, one month in intensive care. As well, since this type of cancer is one of the most agressive, the post-operational treatment consists of radiation and chemotherapy. It is our goal to reach out and gather donations to cover all of her expenses. All treatment together ensures a 74-90 % chance of survival and that's why we will gladly accept every single donation.

Some of you may know her as Reese. But her name is Arica. Her journey has been a long , troublesome and painful one to say the least. On the second week of  November my mom went to the Er with horrible back pain. After many tests it was revealed my mother had cancer. She has been diagnosed with  stage 4 metastatic non small cell lung cancer. It is currently in her lungs, spine, hips, pelvis and ribs. Her Journey--After they found the cancer she was then hospitalized and they began trying to figure out what they should do and where it all was at. They would come to find out she had 2 tumors in her lungs and several on her spine. . A surgery was later done to remove a 3mm lesion and reconstruct her spine. More tests would be done and after a short while they would find out it was also in her hips and pelvis . So they began radiation.  10 treatments to be exact. She was still in pain and was now having difficulty moving her leg with out extreme pain. And could not walk with out a Walker.   On January 9th I drove from ohio to Illinois to be with my mom for 5 days. In those 5 days I watched her agonizing in pain and stressing about Bill's and such.  I ended up finding her a wheelie walker(not sure what it's really called lol) from a nice lady on FB. It helped her tremendously but she needed a wheelchair. Her friend got her one the day after i came back to Ohio♡♡ . Before I left a new sudden pain had arrived she got scheduled to get it checked and they found the cancer has now also spread to her ribs. She has been in and out of the hospital from testing to hospitalizations since then from the intensity of the pain and treatments. She had her first chemo treatment on January 22♡♡♡♡♡On friday January 25th I got a call she went in for pain in her stomach by ambulance.  That turned out to be a blockage in her colon. Her breathing was shallow and o2 was low so they ran tests and found she had 2 blood clots in her lungs and fluid on her lungs as well. So she was admitted again. She was released on 27th to go home but that was short because of instense pain she was readmitted. I made the journey once again on Feb 1st to my mom. She is still currently in the hospital. They have found out thr cancer is through out her pelvis and hip. So she's having radiation treatments again. They are now telling us my mom can not walk on her leg at all its non weight bearing and she has to have someone at home with her at all times. They are placing her in a skilled care facility this week to help her get back and forth from thr hospital for her radiation which is breaking her heart . She doesn't want to be in a facility. We have looked into home health options however it is not covered under my mother's insurance and sadly not affordable . Its roughly 20 a hour at 8 hours a day 5 to 7 days a week depending when my step father works. My mother does have insurance however since she is no longer working all of these finances are falling to my step father . Between the deductables and co pay and monthly fee to keep her insurance she needs help and now for the home health. My step father Lee Noble does work how ever the Bill's are stacking quickly and was so unexpected that they need help covering my mothers cancer treatment Bill's and a home health nurse.  I've offered my mother to come home with me as did my uncle for her to come home with him so she wouldn't need nurses but she keeps saying she doesn't want to leave her home .  . My mother has a very long hard journey ahead of her fighting this cancer. I ask that you donate even just $5 and if you can't donate please share so we can raise the money you help cover her expenses and to have a home health nurse come to her home so she can stay home!!!!",a1530e9a34557d1ced3e1465c0f44c3d,46,0.0526,7.0,0,1,lung cancer,0,1,4,1,1,0.0013192612137203166,0.005277044854881266,0.04245897369106538,1.4114553112135197,4.0,gofundme

We may have family or friends who have been diagnosed with it, or have even personally battled this disease. The evil indifference of cancer means it does not care if you’ve been a good person. It does not care if you are a father, a mother or a child. It does not allow you to dictate when it strikes or how aggressive it will be. Cancer is utterly callous towards life itself. The reasons why some people are forced in to this battle they never chose is oftentimes unexplainable. In our own attempts to understand why this is happening to another we imagine ourselves in their place. We know that any day could be our day and the cruelty of cancer could force us in to this same battle. In a certain way our shared vulnerability to cancer unites us. Cancer is our common enemy and we battle it together. For those who know Sam Storkson it is difficult to think of a time he hasn’t been smiling. His positivity and friendliness are immediately apparent even if you’ve only met him once for a short time. If you’ve seen him with his 3 children, Sonny, Scout and Selah, you’re amazed at how supportive, loving and fun a father he is. Sam’s children are his world and he is theirs. Sam’s rock and center of his universe is his wife Nikki. Their mutual love, adoration and support for each other is inspiring. In February of 2018 Sam was given the life-changing diagnosis of Aggressive Metastatic Papillary Thyroid Cancer. Sam’s had his first surgery, a bilateral neck dissection and a total thyroidectomy (thyroid removal) March 5th. Radioactive iodine therapy followed in May 2018. Side-effects of radioactive iodine and thyroid surgery left Sam with bilateral vocal cord paralysis and difficulty breathing. He subsequently had 2 more surgeries on his vocal fold to help his breathing, but they were not as successful as hoped. In December 2018 an ultrasound showed a new suspicious lymph node, the biopsy came back as cancer and he was referred back to Mayo. Sam’s doctors placed a tracheostomy tube in his airway to alleviate his breathing on January 22, Sam is currently recovering from that operation. Sam will need another surgery in the future to remove the cancer and additional tests will be performed to make sure the cancer has not spread. Despite all of this, Sam is hoping to return to work as soon as possible. If you have seen Sam lately you have noticed his difficulties to speak. Despite his paralyzed vocal cords and trouble breathing this amazing man still makes sure to say hi and ask how YOU are doing; and there is ALWAYS a smile on his face. Over the past year Sam has had to be out of work multiple times for doctor’s appointments, treatments and surgeries. The financial strain a major illness causes can be overwhelming, in addition to the physical and emotional strains. The stress of finances can take away from what Sam should really be focusing on, himself and his family. Sam will not battle this alone. His wife and children will not battle this alone. We will battle with them. Please donate what you can. Every dollar raised means less time Sam and his family have to worry about bills and more time just being a family.

If you are familiar with Stephanie's story, you know that she successfully completed grueling treatment (chemo, radiation and oral chemo) for Triple Negative Breast Cancer in April 2018. Round 2 of this story began when Stephanie went in for a routine scan January 30th, 2019, only to find out that her cancer had returned. Needless to say, the news that the cancer is back so quickly and aggressively is devastating to Stephanie, her family and those who love and support her.This Tuesday, February 5th, Stephanie will visit her oncology team for a more in depth look at the cancer cells. At that time, her team will devise a plan for the best way to treat this cancer while keeping Stephanie as comfortable as possible. The Isaacs Family will likely also be traveling to Cancer Specialists across the world, to get second opinions and alternative treatment options. They are willing to do whatever it takes to give Stephanie the best chance at survival. In true Stephanie fashion, she is determined to fight like hell against this cancer. And we know that the village that surrounds her and her family will be there every step of the way. The Isaacs Family has taken on the huge burden of cancer, both financially and emotionally, once before. On the financial side, it is no secret that medical bills are very expensive and draining. While insurance covers some aspects of treatment, it doesn't come close to covering the extensive expenses that will come up. Unfortunately, this fight has reached a critical point, and for the first time, they need the financial support of her tribe. Emotionally, cancer can be just as draining. Money from this campaign could help ease some of that burden, so that Stephanie, Steve and Vince may enjoy quality time together without worrying so much about the financial stress.There are many people who have asked how they can help. Donating to this campaign will provide the financial comfort that is much needed at this time. 100% of all monies raised will be given to the Isaacs family to be used wherever they feel it is most needed.Stephanie, Steve and Vince are overwhelmed by the amount of love and support they have already received in this short amount of time.

After a six-hour surgery and a round of radiation, followed two years later by another tumor, long surgery and round of chemo … we thought Kelly had beat the odds.She was cancer free for 38 years. On September 25, 2018, Kelly experienced a seizure followed by many more in the ensuing months. What was first thought as a stroke was later confirmed as another brain tumor. For those who do not know Kelly, she may well be the sweetest, kindest and most gentle soul you could ever meet. She is a friend to all furry creatures and loves adventure, traveling, hiking and biking.  Kelly is an extremely compassionate person with a heart of gold — and beloved aunt to her nieces and nephew. Parts of her life have not been easy or fair, but despite her ongoing fight with cancer, she remains optimistic and ready to put on her boxing gloves to show cancer who is boss. The operation to remove her latest brain tumor was on January 22, 2019.  The resulting biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) — an incredibly aggressive and fast-growing form of cancer.  Kelly has a long, tough road ahead.  As a result of the surgery, she has lost most movement in her right arm and right leg. She is currently undergoing physical therapy at an in-patient rehabilitation center for the next few weeks to regain her strength and let her brain heal. She will most likely require significant rounds of chemotherapy, radiation, and outpatient physical therapy.  Her recovery is very much a work in progress.We are establishing this fund to help assist Kelly with her out-of-pocket medical and living expenses.  She is currently unable to work and because of her pre-existing condition, insurance has always been — and will continue to be — an uphill battle.

Lots of tears, intense physical pain, the inability to sleep, and feelings of despair. As you know, I did extensive research on clinics all over the world and decided I want to get treatment at the Hope 4 Cancer Institute in Mexico. It’s a 3 week inpatient program of cutting edge nontoxic treatments, they treat the disease holistically, and I know it’s the right place for me. It includes a plethora of different daily treatments from 7 different modalities: Non-Toxic Cancer Therapies, ImmunoModulation, Full Spectrum Nutrition, Detoxification, Oxygenation, Restore Microbiome, and Emotional/Spiritual Healing. It also includes accommodations for 2 (so Jeff can come with me), 3 organic vegan meals per day plus organic juices and smoothies for both me and Jeff, and two follow-up visits for me after 3 months and 6 months. When I leave, they give me enough Sunivera Immunotherapy (which includes GcMAF) and MaraGen to continue my treatments at home for 3 months, and the Sono Photo Dynamic Therapy device I need to continue that treatment at home for 1 year. The cost is $47,000, which is why I started this GoFundMe page. The campaign started off gangbusters, but has tapered off, not surprisingly. What you don’t know is that I have a large inoperable tumor over my sternum that is attached to my sternum bone and chest wall and it’s been growing quite aggressively, so every day that goes by where I am in physical pain and not able to start treatment has been unbearable.A couple named Olivia and Larry Cook saw my post about this on Instagram ~ their account is @naturalhelperx. They reached out to me as philanthropists who want to give as much as possible to people in need before the end of 2018. I was so excited, and I emailed them all about my situation. They replied that they could send me all the money I needed, but I would have to send them a $107 transfer fee. My heart sank. I Googled their email address and discovered that they are scam artists who prey upon homeless people and people in dire health crises. I started sobbing tears of despair.Well, today I am crying tears of joy. Jeff did something heroic for me, something he would ordinarily have never considered ~ he made an early withdrawal from the IRA he’s had since high school to get me the remaining money I need to start my treatment! We’re leaving early tomorrow (Monday) morning, and we will be back on Christmas Day! There is a 60-day window within which he can replace that money so as to maintain the health and integrity of the account and not have to pay taxes and major penalties on that early withdrawal, so I am determined to make that happen. If you can make a donation, even if it’s just a few dollars, I would be eternally grateful. Every bit helps. GoFundMe does take 3% of each donation, so if you'd prefer to donate to me via PayPal, my email is funny@suzannewhang.com -- be sure to use the ""Send to Friends and Family"" option so that I don't get charged a service fee.Or you can mail me a check ~ send an email to me at gookwaffle@gmail.com and I will give you my address.I am SO relieved and excited to start my treatment! Thanks to every one of you for your emotional and financial support, and special thanks to Jeff Vezain, my twin flame, the love of my life, and my knight in shining armor.  By the way, we never got around to breaking up...Send me good energy, and I look forward to regaling you with magnificent stories about my path back to wellness!Love,Suzanne+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Original post (11/15/18)Holy crapwaffle.  I can't believe this is happening again.  I'm taking this Asian overachiever thing to a whole new level.  You know how they say God doesn't give you anything you can't handle?  Well, God must really think I'm a badass.  Here's a video of my journey that was done in 2015: https://youtu.be/-MjDg0n_R1kBack in 2011 when I was given 6 months to live from stage 4 breast cancer, I went $500,000 in debt from cancer treatments that were not covered by my insurance.  With the help of family, friends, and fans back then, I raised about $250,000 from online fundraisers and fundraising events.  I thought I had reversed the cancer and was cancer-free since 2011, but it turns out that while the tumors were gone, the cancer stem cells were not.I wanted to gather as much information as possible before creating this fundraiser.Don't let my goal amount intimidate you.  Every dollar helps.So... here's the latest chapter of my story.  On the evening of Oct 15th as I was driving home from my friend Vanessa’s birthday party ~ I started experiencing intense chest pains, shortness of breath, and tingling in my left arm.  I thought I was having a heart attack, so I asked Jeff to take me to the emergency room at Providence St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank.  I also have a bump over my sternum from what I thought was costochondritis caused by my T-10 vertebra kyphoplasty back in 2011.  Several times in the past, I've had costochondritis which is inflammation caused by lifting something heavy and irritating the area over the sternum ~ I would ice it and rest for a few days, and it would disappear completely.  The ER doctor, Dr. Herrera, did an EKG on me, and it came back normal.  That ruled out a STEMI heart attack.  Then he did blood tests on my cardiac enzymes that all came back normal.  That ruled out a non-STEMI heart attack and a blood clot.  Then he did an x-ray of my sternum, which came back normal.  That ruled out a broken bone.  And then he did a CT scan.  About an hour later, Dr. Herrera came into to my ER room with the CT scan results and a sad look on his face.  He said that this bump over my sternum is cancerous.  He said that's what was causing my chest pains.  He also found lesions on the bone of my sternum, on two of my ribs, and in both of my lungs.  The test results are consistent with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer.  So this is now my second time with stage 4 cancer.  Fuck.  He gave me a tiny dose of morphine to help me with the pain (the dosage they use for small children), because I am a lightweight when it comes to medication.I was devastated.  Jeff was in the ER hospital room with me when I got the CT scan results, thank God.  He's been incredibly kind and loving and supportive.  Then I remembered a documentary that a friend recently told me about called ""The Truth About Cancer,"" so I watched it.I already knew some of the information from my research in 2011, but a lot of it was brand new to me and incredibly eye-opening.  It was fascinating, infuriating, and ultimately inspiring.Here it is, if you haven't seen it and are interested.Episode 1:   https://youtu.be/KqJAzQe7_0gEpisode 2:   https://youtu.be/VK_sX5ko8SEI am now energized and optimistic about reclaiming my health and curing the cancer at the root, this time permanently.The next day after being in the emergency room, I was on the phone on hold for 6 hours with different physicians and branches of Medi-Cal (the health insurance that I have), in order to get an approved referral to Dr. Berkowitz, who was my oncologist in 2011 and the only holistic oncologist I've ever encountered.  He's awesome because he's open-minded.  I'm working towards getting referred to him, which is turning out to be much more difficult that I was told.In the meantime, I've been using CBD, cannabis salve, frankincense oil, and eating organic vegan.  After extensive research, I have selected the Hope 4 Cancer Institute in Baja.  It's an inpatient 3-week program.  Here is a link to the clinic: http://www.hope4cancer.com/I will be receiving Sono Photo Dynamic Therapy: https://hope4cancer.com/our-therapies/sono-photo-dynamic-therapy/And will be given what I need to continue my therapy for one year at home after I check out of the clinic.And MaraGen: https://ph.pronuvia.com/products/maragen/I will be given a 3 month supply to continue taking at home after I check out of the clinic.I will also be receiving Sunivera Immunotherapy: https://hope4cancer.com/our-therapies/sunivera-immunotherapy/And I will receive injections to continue the treatment at home for one year.I need to raise $47,000 ASAP ~ because the sooner I get to the clinic, the sooner I can start these treatments.The reason I'm trying to raise more money is because I don't want to stress about having to work for a couple of months, and my new healthy lifestyle will include food and supplements and treatments in LA to maintain my health (including things like acupuncture, massage, hyperbaric oxygen, hyperthermia, etc.)Please feel free to share this fundraiser with anyone you think might be willing to help me.Remember, if you're wealthy, you can donate up to $14,000 tax-free as a gift to any individual once a year.  Hope 4 Cancer Institute's program includes transportation from San Diego, accommodations for 3 weeks, 3 organic vegetarian meals daily, juices and smoothies, not just for me, but for a companion as well -- Jeff is going to come with me!  It includes every treatment each day (up to 8 different kinds), and all the treatments I take with me to continue at home.Here's how you can help me ~ visualize me getting better permanently this time, eradicating all the cancer stem cells this time.  Don't worry about me or tell me how worried you are.  That's doesn't help me.If you don't agree with my path, keep it to yourself.  I have done thousands of hours of research since 2006, and I am in charge of my recovery.  If you want to share with me some new revolutionary treatment or holistic or naturopathic or nutrition-based information, first ask me if I've tried it or heard of it, and then ask if I want to learn more.If you can't afford to make a donation, please share this with someone who might be able to.Thank you in advance for caring about me.  I know that once again, I will be loved back to life.And if I happen to see you somewhere out and about in the LA area, please hug me gently, because of my sternum tumor.  I am in a lot of pain today, but most days I feel good.With love, gratitude, optimism, and confidence that I will reclaim my health

Two weeks of no school and presents soon to be had, Savanna just didn’t seem quite herself.   Walking up the stairs from our basement made her heart race, and she would constantly say she was tired.  The first snowfall left our backyard a sledding haven, only to be enjoyed for a brief time because she “just felt exhausted”.   Sleeping in went from 10am to noon, with troubles waking her up. I figured it’s Christmas break, let her enjoy some rest. The New Year came and passed, and the kids returned to school. Within the first week of returning, I received a call from the school nurse. She wanted to inform me of an incident Savanna had during her first hour P.E.  She became weak and dizzy, lightheaded and nauseous. The nurse said she checked her blood pressure and it appeared low.  She just wanted me to know.  During the next week Savanna complained of a couple of headaches and again, being tired.  Around this time she brought to my attention hundreds of little red pin-dots from the tops of her feet and covering her legs up to her knees.  My thoughts were maybe something viral and she’s fighting an infection. I got another call from the nurse at school about a week from the last episode.  Again, Savanna was near passing out during P.E.  She suggested, and I concurred, a pediatrician visit was needed. I called the pediatrician’s office, indicating her symptoms of headaches, dizziness, nausea, rapid heart racing and a rash.  On January 15th, Savanna’s pediatrician examined her.   He explains to us the dizziness and heart rate and low blood pressure comes from orthostatic hypotension. Tells us to change her diet in the mornings, drink plenty more water, and carry on.  As he is about to wrap up the visit, I asked him what about the rash.  He proceeded to lift her pants to inspect her legs, and saw the hundreds of little red dots covering them. He indicated the medical term for this as Petechiae. He says it comes from straining.  I told him no injuries have occurred and found it odd to be on both of her legs.  He said we will keep an eye on it and not to search out the google doctor because I’ll be worried sick.  Our visit was over. Throughout the next week we tried to change her breakfast diet a little, bought her a Tervis water bottle, and went about life. Another call from the school nurse on January 24th left me calling the pediatrician and stating my concerns as well as the school nurse’s,  about the dismissed rash and other continued symptoms. I received a call back from the pediatrician’s office, and was told that the doctor has ordered an EKG to be done on Savanna, then we will go from there. No appointment or urgency, just walk into the hospital when you are able, and once they have the results they will follow up. The next 48 hours were a series of events that took place that will make an unbeliever rethink their doubts about divine intervention. I was to be boarding a plane for takeoff to Florida on Friday, January 25th, 8:15am. In the early hours of this morning, I came down with a vile bout of a stomach bug, vomiting and such, and unable to move out of bed to get ready for my flight.  My trip was cancelled.  The kids felt so terribly for me, as they knew I was looking forward to this trip for sometime.  I assured them I wasn’t disappointed, and would just  spend the weekend with them since I didn’t have to work. I noticed Savanna not feeling particularly well. She was warm with a fever and complained of her throat hurting.  I was glad that I had been unable to fly, and to be home with her knowing she was now sick.  Saturday morning came around and we all got to enjoy the rarity of sleeping in.  By 10:30, we were all awake with the exception of Savanna.  I went to check on her and she felt hot, and complained of an even worse sore throat.  My other children and I continued on with our Saturday morning chores.  Around 1pm I decided to check her fever.  It was 102.5°.   Savanna, her sister, and I entered Anderson emergency room at the recommendation from our insurance, around 4:30. They swabbed her for the suspected strep throat I was sure she had. We waited patiently for the ER pediatrician to come in.  When he did, he informs us the strep culture came back negative.  Weird, I thought.  He proceeds to examine her.  Her spleen was enlarged, she had a heart murmur, and appeared anemic. He asked if I’ve heard this before about the heart murmur.  I told him no, and that her pediatrician said nothing of the sort 10 days prior. He continues to order lab work and other tests.  The whole works. I’m thankful he’s being thorough while we are there.  About an hour passed and the pediatrician returned. His grim look was no different than at our introduction.  He sits down on the swivel stool and says he has bad news.  With my daughters and myself all ears, his next sentence is one I have never imagined would be spoken to me.  It looks like leukemia. With uncontrollable shaking and the sound of Savanna’s voice in the background repeating “am I going to die”, all I could think was “please, God, give me the words to say to her to bring her peace and comfort, and assure her she has a long life to live”.  It is incomprehensible how one will respond to a traumatic turn of events. Only until it stabs you in the heart, will you know you’re true strengths and weaknesses. Savanna is a fighter.  She always has been, and I’m pretty positive always will be.  She fights with me. She fights with her twin brother.  She fights with her little sister.  Sometimes she fights with her friends.  She is fighting this cancer to the end.  And she will win. Backstory: Three years ago to this past month of January, our family had been displaced.  What my children knew as the perfect family life was stripped from them in an instant. Addiction took their father out of our lives, losing our home, our vehicles,  our dear neighbors and friends, and everything we knew as our normal.   Moving back to my home state to be helped by my family meant leaving their friends, starting a new school, and trying to start life over again, but without their father.  Multiple attempts of his recovery and relapse have left my children fully reliant upon me.  I wouldn’t have it otherwise.  I’ve stepped away from my employment for the time being, to be by her bedside night and day. With the help of dear family and friends, we are fighting this battle with her. I am setting up relief funds for her and her up-and-coming medical expenses, as well as travel expenses, child care, food, and living assistance, as I am hers and her 2 siblings’ sole provider and care taker during this endeavor. Help us in supporting Savanna along the way with this journey to heal her and help reach our goal, 2B CANCER FREE!!! We’ve come too far to let this little thing called cancer stand in our way. We’ve initiated this fund for the sake of my daughter’s recently diagnosed leukemia, as well as our family’s wellbeing.   We are at the infant stages of this process known as chemotherapy. I know the outpouring of love and support we’ve received in just a few short days has been overwhelming, and continues to be so. We know there’s a journey ahead of all of us for Savanna, which includes herself, her brother, sister, myself, and the dear family and friends that help and support us. Alleviating some of the financial obligations during our endeavor would make this that much less worrisome and fearful. We MORE than appreciate the support, love, aide, and prayers that pour in for Savanna and our family.  Please follow us on our Caring Bridge account that will be up and running hopefully no later than February 8th, 2019. With so much love, thank you ❤️",19a397251c3949e26c26ab10b07675c4,98,0.251,9.0,4,1,leukemia,0,4,0,1,0,0.002728512960436562,0.0,0.7162196039107546,13.383731635693502,0.0,gofundme

In july 2017 I did comprehensive PET scan that showed me cancer-free. In March  2018 I started having strange bone pains along with gastrointestinal issues, that I was focusing on. In summer 2018 everything got worse, I had to quit my job after few months and significantly lost weight, moving around was an issue, I was fatigued, I made it to ER few times with low-grade fever but nobody could determine what is going on, sending me home with gastrointestinal diagnosis’s. Finally, on November 25, 2018 I went to ER and they were able to see Cancer  lesions on my spine (along with fracture on spine and neck), I was happy I finally got the diagnosis. After many comprehensive tests it showed I have cancer in my hips, pelvic bone, femurs, ribs, neck, liver, and a few other soft tissues. It is not curable but treatable and I started on new pioneer targeted chemotherapy drug Kisqali that in a month it eliminated pretty much all my bone pains. I was doing great. But I had to go to radiation, to treat my neck and spine fractures before it broke and I was paralyzed. My insurance approved only 10 radiation treatment vs. 14-20. So, each time I was getting more radiation and it made me very sick.  I lost my voice because radiation burned esophagus and throat, I was nauseous and after 4 treatments passed out in Radiation doctor’s office. I had to be transported to nearby hospital by firefighters where I stayed the day. Later we got enormous bill for the 5 minutes of my Firetruck ride. Because I was weak and couldn’t eat I was sent to a whole day infusion procedure where they fed my body through IV. The big mistake on doctor’s part was that radiation affects white cell production and lowers it. And along with that my oncologist made the decision to continue on chemotherapy drug which also made white cells low. This state is called neutropenia.Last Wednesday I suddenly stopped walking. I thought it was because I was fatigued. On Friday I started having neutropenic fever and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors found multiple bacteria in my blood which is called sepsis. I was put on heavy antibiotics treatment plan, people had to be fully dressed in protective clothing to see me. So, my white cells count went up during my 6-day stay at the hospital, and I’m still at the hospital, because they are checking bacteria in my blood.  After my discharge I will have to have several weeks of IV infusions at home. Every bad event brings great things - I met an amazing caring oncologist that took over my case.I never thought I would be this way. I never thought I would have to learn to walk again. Few of you, my kind friends, offered financial assistance and insisted on this page and we considered. Medical bills pile up quickly and I’m not coming back to work for few months, so your money will really help with our medical expenses. Don’t feel obligated but please share on social media. Thank you everybody. I love you all.Sincerely, Katrina Jadue",92f43ea25cd526a54719e79e44fb51f6,31,0.8813,5.0,2,1,breast cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

Please ""share""!♥ ***Maria Jiménez, a long-time human rights, social justice, and immigrant rights advocate, is now waging a SECOND battle against cancer. In 2018, she completed cancer treatment (surgery and chemotherapy) at MD Anderson for Stage Four Primary Peritoneal Cancer (PPC), a rare cancer that develops most commonly in women. Recently, Maria suffered from fluid in her lungs and after extensive medical tests, she was notified by MD Anderson on Jan. 30, 2019, that cancer has returned to her lung and esophagus. She begins chemotherapy for a second time next week (Feb. 2019), and she will need our help. Thanks to everyone's donations last year ($11,555), we were able to cover her medical bills (which included four trips to MD Anderson's emergency room).Maria is now 68-years-old and only works part-time. Please help her by donating to help cover her costly medical bills.Initially, I had hoped to raise funds for her medical bills and rebuild her house (several people promised to help with her house last year, but failed to do so). She currently rents an apartment, but it is located on the third floor and it will be extremely difficult for her to climb stairs once chemotherapy once again weakens her body.The most important thing now is to help lift the financial burden as she wages the fight of her life for a second time. Please, please donate -- and spread the word -- so, together, we may help our dear friend, Maria Jimenez.For over five decades, Maria has selflessly given her life in service to our community, and she needs our help to cover medical and living expenses. Her home is also in badly need of repairs with no electricity (wiring bad), mold, and an unsustainable structure, so she is forced to rent a third-floor apartment. A construction company's inspection report found her house unstable, warning the walls would collapse with the weight of a new roof. A complete tear-down and rebuild is needed.Many may be unaware that Maria was highly instrumental in advocating with ARCA (a group she helped to found) for the successful legalization of over 350,000 late amnesty cases related to President Reagan's 1986 IRCA law. On Mother's Day in 1996, Maria was featured in a feminist conference along with Gloria Steinem, Angela Davis, and Mililani Trask.

You've been asking how you can help so it’s only fair that you know the whole story.On December 4, 2018 our family received news that our father, Tony, was diagnosed with stage 4-A squamous cell carcinoma. The six centimeter tumor was positioned underneath his tongue, resting against his jawbone, inhibiting his ability to speak and eat. Thankfully, the team at the University of Kansas Health System was able to get him scheduled for surgery on December 28. Dr. Andres Bur and his team worked flawlessly for eight hours, removing two-thirds of his tongue (glossectomy), nearly all of his jaw (mandiblectomy), and 61 lymph nodes from his neck. Dad’s reconstructive surgery is called a free flap where they take a piece of his fibula, calf muscle, and skin from his left leg to rebuild a new jaw and floor of his mouth. Dad had top dentures before surgery and with the removal of his jaw, he was left with no teeth. Dad now has to re-learn how to breathe, swallow, and talk with a trach tube which will take months of speech therapy. Effective communication has been one of the biggest challenges.Shortly after surgery, we met with a kidney specialist and found out that Dad has a second, separate type of cancer that is not related to the cancer in his mouth. The renal cell carcinoma is slow growing but is currently the size of a golf ball. It is large enough that he will need to have his entire right kidney removed. Thankfully, he has another kidney that is functioning properly. Dad will start radiation and chemotherapy in the next week or so to kill off the remaining microscopic cancer cells in his head and neck that the doctors were unable to remove with surgery. Radiation will be Monday through Friday. Chemotherapy will be once a week. Both treatments are expected to go for six to seven weeks. The type of chemotherapy Dad has been prescribed can cause significant damage to the kidneys so all of the oncologists have agreed to wait until after Dad is done with radiation and chemo to proceed with the kidney removal.As if that wasn’t enough to endure, on Saturday, February 2, 2019, our family received a phone call that Dad’s place of business had caught fire. Dad has worked as an upholsterer and a private business owner of Veteran’s Upholstery for more than 30 years. We were very fortunate that no one was injured but everything inside is a total loss, including current customers’ furniture that was waiting to get re-upholstered. The building itself is covered by insurance, however, the contents within are not. Thousands of dollars’ worth of materials and equipment are unsalvageable. With Dad’s recent cancer diagnosis, he has been unable to work since his surgery date, leaving Mom to be the sole income earner, working countless hours of overtime to make up the difference.The start of the year brought on a new annual healthcare deductible and billing cycle. Medical costs continue to grow well beyond initial estimates. Daily expenses include formula tube feedings, wound care, and home health visits. Monthly expenses include mortgage payment, utilities, car payments, rent and utilities for the shop, etc. Future expenses will include several sets of new dentures as his jaw continues to heal, shop restoration, and reimbursing clients for value of items lost.Thank you to everyone who has prayed and continue to do so. Thank you for any and all future contributions. We’ll keep you all posted on this ongoing journey as Dad focuses on getting healthier and we start to rebuild his livelihood.  --The Nguyen Family",672eb6e877b6954b971869de15c635ff,29,0.37144,7.0,6,1,general,0,0,1,0,1,0.0,0.0015748031496062992,0.9708069402368493,0.0,1.0,gofundme

This go fund me account will help assure that KEV will be able to afford the insurance needed to treat his illness, and pay any additional medical expenses, rent, and other needs while he is recovering.As some of you know in 2016 KEV was diagnosed with colon cancer and had emergency surgery to save his life. During the surgery they removed a tumor blocking his intestines and 14 inches of colon. Unfortunately, this was followed by a massive infection leading to weeks of hospitalization and mounting expenses.It was a long road to recovery. Months of chemotherapy had devastating side effects, preventing him from playing the guitar or ukulele, and from making a living. Just as he was getting on his feet the doctors found tumors and infection in his liver, and he had another surgery to remove a third of his liver. Recovery from these two surgeries has been a huge set back. Last year he suffered another setback when his retina detached leading to two additional surgeries and more time out of work. He had just begun rebuilding his life and career for the third time only to find out last month that he once again has colon cancer.      Awesome students leaning and having fun.KEV’s surgery is scheduled for February 6. After surgery we will know more about his cancer, recovery, and further treatment. Recovery and additional chemotherapy could take months, and for someone who is self-employed, that is devastating.Anything you can give will help KEV return to his life, his career, to all his Tikis, to his students who miss him greatly, and to making music for everyone to enjoy.Kev and his Tikis at Comic-ConFrom Kev (in his own words to his amazing Tikis):“SNEAKY TIKI WILL GO ON!

(Jaime's friends & family have created this gofund me for her.) This is Jaime’s 2nd battle with cancer in December of 2015. She was diagnosed with a triple negative breast cancer. She went through 8 rounds of chemo, a double mastectomy, many rounds of radiations, and had several lymph nodes removed. The doctors believed Jaime to be cancer free in August 2016.The cancer has come back and is more aggressive than ever.  The metastatic cancer is not curable. Jaime will fight this for the rest of her life. The metastatic breast cancer has spread to several places. Through many tests and procedures lately, they have determined that there are cancer lesions on the top of her spine, mid spine, low spine, right hip, pelvic bone, and several places in her liver.  Jaime is in extreme pain. The tumors are putting too much pressure on her bones which is causing them to weaken and fracture. She is also having muscle spasms, nerve pain, and nausea. Everyday tasks are very difficult for Jaime to complete. She is unable to work.  Her return to work is unknown. This is the hardest time in Jaime’s life and she needs the love, support, and prayers of her friends & family more than ever.  It is very important that we  help Jaime  focus all of her energy on keeping her mind and body strong.  This is not the time for her to worry about financial burdens. All money raised will go to support her everyday needs and medical expenses as she fights this battle. Insurance has been covering the majority of the medical expenses. We are having a difficult time getting them to cover the prescriptions. Insurance will not cover trials or alternative medicines. We will need to start raising money for these as well.  Her current treatment plan is as follows:- 12 weeks of Chemotherapy (Currently in week 3)- 10 treatments of radiation over 2 weeks (treatment #4 was today)- Blood transfusions (treatment #1 was today)- Bone strengthening medicine (treatment #1 today)- With positive results from the chemo and radiation, she will be able to start a trial in 9 weeks.It is incredibly important that Jaime stays positive and keeps her body healthy enough to be a candidate for the trail. Jaime has changed her diet to a large amount of protein, fruits & veggies, and complex carbs (No Processed foods).  We have set up a meal train for her. Hoping to provide 3 dinners per week or easy frozen meals that could be cooked in a crock pot or oven.The link to Jaime's meal train: https://mealtrain.com/z9m78yAny donations are greatly appreciated. Donations can be made through gofundme,  cash, checks, meals, grocery store giftcards, ect.We will be doing a couple fundraising events to raise money for Jaime.

This left me feeling anxious, “What would I do?” I live this harsh experience just a day after my mother dies of cancer in Venezuela, without me being able to say goodbye. The next shocking development was being diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer, which I had back on July of 2014 but now reappeared extended to my spine, liver, and abdominal wall. My first worry was how to face this situation. Thank God I’m in the United States, land of opportunity, and my doctors decided to perform two spine surgeries, during which I had a high risk of being paralyzed. I had two procedures on 08/28/2018 and 08/31/2018, in which they installed a titanium prosthesis in my back.After I recovered from both spine surgeries, during October of 2018, I received 10 sessions of radiotherapy and began chemotherapy.

Those who know her describe her as a pure soul brimming with positive energy.She was diagnosed with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) in 2010, but she failed to get a good response from the (Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor), chemo drugs meant to treat her CML. Her family has been preparing her for a stem cell transplant but unfortunately, she developed antibodies against all her viable donors. Simply put, with these antibodies, the chances of Aia rejecting the donor stem cells is higher than high, leading to graft failure, and could be potentially fatal.Unfortunately, her disease has accelerated to blast crisis this month, and she has been under hospital confinement ever since. Due to her state, she has been dependent on platelet and blood transfusions every other day; a single transfusion costs a very large sum of money. Her organs have been greatly affected and she is in constant excruciating pain due to the side effects of her current treatment. She has lost a lot of weight and her limbs are painfully thin (even though she may look pudgy because of the fluids). Right now, our goal is to get her out of blast crisis so her doctors can proceed to sorting out transplant issues as it still is the curative treatment for her condition.Despite all these, Aia remains as the hopeful, kind and brave girl that she is. Having a positive outlook, she would always muster the energy to smile in spite of the pain. We her cousins love her greatly, and so we took the initiative to set up a campaign here at GoFundMe. Aia still has her whole life ahead of her. We are appealing to your compassion, kindness, and generosity to help Aia and her family. Hospitalization, transfusions and chemotherapy costs are currently on the top shelf of her needs. Unable to bear the sight of her pain, her mom Aimee at one point told her to surrender everything to the Lord if the suffering becomes too great. But Aia says she wants to fight.And so we fight.

I have a wonderful family, a wife, two daughters, 3 and 6 years old, good job. Life was going great until suddenly in August of 2017, a terrible diagnosis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Stage 3 cancer was made which they deemed inoperable. Here also began, various medical tests, sleepless nights, bad thoughts which simply can’t get rid of. I think I am understood by those who have ever faced this ailment.Doctors at first said that I needed an operation to remove the pancreas that would prolong life, but needed to go through a couple of chemotherapy courses to reduce size of the tumors. At that point there were two of them. Two months of chemotherapy and the prognosis was positive in which the tumors reduced in size. After the prior session the Doctors recommended another two months of continuous chemotherapy which after unfortunately proved to not end up working.  The original size of the tumors returned and the physicians once again recommended further radiation and treatment. Even before I made it to my appointment I ended up in the ER with an abundance of pain. Tests, CT Scans were done in which they found that the tumors grew and spread into the liver attributing to Stage 4 Liver cancer as well. In my gut I felt that due to the intense radiation and chemotherapy instead of it helping in actuality it only increased the size of the tumors and helped them to spread. Until this point the doctors and I had hope that a surgery would be an option but at this given time that is no longer an option. The doctors pretty much gave up on my case and told me nothing else can be done and to wait it out. No one can really imagine how difficult it was the next step I had to go through when I had to inform my family of this prognosis, pretty much telling them I have limited amount of time to live. There are other treatments that give hope to patients like myself but of course require additional funding. In life, every person at one moment reaches a point in which they have to ask for help. I hoped that I had enough strength and money to fight this battle by myself but unfortunately my health is disintegrating and further funds are needed for new treatment that provided more hope for recovery. I have my wife and kids to live for and can’t imagine giving up on them.

On 12/22/2019, Taylor felt a lump in her left breast and five weeks later, she was in her first chemotherapy session. She's been diagnosed with Stage 2A invasive ductal carcinoma, a very common, yet aggressive breast cancer. She is early stage, with a ER+, PR+, HER2- pathology (a favorable treatment profile). The doctors and Taylor have a good outlook, and she is looking forward to being on the other side of this, with new eyes full of wisdom! She does have a tough road ahead. She will begin with 5 months of ACT chemotherapy (the hard stuff) to shrink the tumor, then on to surgery, and 5-10 years of hormone therapy. She is a full-time biologist for our nearby coast and ocean, and while she will continue working part time, she will have to give up a lot of field work during treatment, as it requires handling dead animals. Taylor has been on the Bay Area hustle of also bartending at the Rite Spot, and has to let that source of income go to focus one healing and recovery. During the next year, she won't be able to work the 50 hours/week she's accustomed to.

Many days have its challenges! But we’re believing that in the midst of chaos, God is in complete control! No one ever wants to hear that their cancer has returned. In December 2013, my husband, Richard Pyfrom was diagnosed with Colorectal Cancer. With no family history and too young to imagine such a diagnosis (just 37 years of age), we were dealt this devastating news. Nevertheless, he underwent surgery which removed a large portion of his large intestine and cycles of chemotherapy with high doses of radiation that took a toll on his body and ultimately, affected his quality of life daily. Consequently, this was a battle he wished to never undergo again.To our dismay in October 2018, after experiencing severe itching, abdominal bloating and jaundice of the skin and eyes, he was admitted to the local hospital. After numerous tests, the CT scan had revealed that his cancer had returned and had spread aggressively to his liver. At age 41 - the youngest of all his siblings, Advanced Liver Metastasis: Stage 4 is his diagnosis. His liver is severely diseased and covered in tumors. The tumors have blocked his bile duct and gall bladder preventing drainage from his liver into the gall bladder and intestine. This has caused the liver to become enlarged and caused leakage of bile and bilirubin into his abdominal cavity and bloodstream, hence his intense systematic itching and jaundice. Lack of medical insurance and reliance on public healthcare system, led to weeks to schedule appointment dates for any sort of treatment. Surgery is NOT recommended because of the vast quantity of tumors. Radiation is also NOT a viable option because of the dosage given during his initial cancer treatment sessions. In the first week of December 2018, he was scheduled to do chemotherapy only to be told that his bilirubin levels were too high with no proposed advice or solution on how to lower those levels. Thus, if chemotherapy was given it would have poisoned his body. It was then recommended that he only be given two of the three intended drugs that would bypass his liver. However, this left doubt on the drugs’ effectiveness. Additionally, with his previous and ongoing experiences from chemotherapy, Richard has opted out of such treatments, leaving them as a last resort.With that being said, he has decided to adopt a non-toxic, holistic alternative treatment, All-Natural Alkaline Herbal Detox Cleansing Therapy. We, his family fully support this decision and hope that this method will ultimately heal him. Thus, improving his quality of life as the disease has caused jaundice, excessive fatigue and itching, extreme weight loss and bloating coupled with physical, emotional/mental, spiritual, and financial distress. Since he has begun this method we have already began to see promising results. He’s been more active and energized, feeling less bloating with reduced itching. Consequently, he had developed a refreshed and hopeful frame of mind. However, the treatments are costly! Alkaline herbal therapy medicines, Alkaline organic diet (food/drinks), miscellaneous supplies, ointments, pills totals approximately $2,500.00 of monthly expenses.However, to our dismay, his abdomen and lower extremities ballooned about a month ago. This posed great concern. Consequently, oncologists were contacted once again. He is scheduled to have an appointment on February 7th, 2019. This consultation may result in chemotherapy being the method of treatment, as his only option. However, we are unsure if he may be eligible for such treatment as previously mentioned. Additionally, the cost of the treatment is also unknown as it is based on the type of chemotherapy as well as the dosage. As this disease has prevented him from working and he was the breadwinner of our home, our family has been doing our endeavor best to cover costs, amongst other daily expenses, on our own. But we are now in desperate need of help to continue his journey to health and wellness. For those who know Richard they are aware of the incredibly sweet, humble, hardworking, and devoted father he is. His commitment to his family and his love for bowling and his bowling family (whom we are forever grateful for) is immeasurable.  Today, we kindly ask you to search your hearts and assist us in whatever manner you can with this endeavor. Whether you’re able to make a small donation or not, we do need your prayers! So, we ask too, that you continue to pray for Richard as he continues to battle this disease in search of having a better quality of life that he can spend with his wife, kids, family and friends. We are truly grateful for your support, continued prayers and words of encouragement.

AGAIN!  Relapse is not a word you EVER want to hear. Sulley is the most warmhearted and loving kid, you'd ever want to meet!  He has a zest for life, laughing and making people happy.  He brings a smile to every face he meets and we're so proud to call him our son.  We couldn't even begin to imagine a world without him in it! For his recent relapse, we were at a family gathering for Christmas when Sulley reached out in front of me and I noticed petechiae (bleeding of the blood vessels) on his arm.  I froze!  That coupled with the fact that he had been more tired and a little nauseas, made my heart sink.  We rushed him to St. Louis Children's Hospital, where he was given a platelet transfusion and we were sent home the next day.  We had a normal clinic appointment coming up on Tuesday. However, that Monday, we got a call from Sulley's oncologist that no parent should get...  Sulley's cancer was back! Sulley has taken this diagnosis and relapse like a real champ; never once complaining about what life has dumped on his doorstep.  He has 2 younger brothers, Jude and Leo, that adore him and he has set an amazing example of strength for them.  Sulley has a hard fight ahead, he knows it, and he handles it with so much grace! Today is day #45 inpatient in the hospital for Sulley.  He is going to have a brand new immunotherapy called car-t cell therapy to save his life.  Car-t has an 80% chance of working.  They took Sulley's t-cells out of his body by a process called pheresis.  They then sent the t-cells to a lab in New Jersey to be modified into cancer fighting cells.  The t-cells will then recognize the CD-19 protein that leukemia carries on it and attack and destroy it and eventually filling Sulley's bone marrow back up with healthy cells. This new immunotherapy comes with a lot of risks.  Sulley has taken so many beatings from cancer in the past and he just keeps getting back up.  We have great faith that he will do so well with this new therapy.  However, it also comes with a heavy financial burden (as cancer itself does).  We have started this gofundme to help us ease the financial burden and focus on our time and treatment with Sulley.  As you can imagine the cost of having cancer can be astronomical! Please follow along with Sulley's story at ""Sulley's Journey"" on Facebook.  Sharing this gofundme is just as vital as donating, so please share away!  Thank you all for your love and support!  ❤❤",9652abf7123cdc2b05f34927c5658890,35,0.17448,10.0,3,1,leukemia,0,4,1,2,1,0.007619047619047619,0.0019047619047619048,0.028642149929278642,4.82291062242704,1.0,gofundme

Easily recognisable with his full head of dreads, you may know him from the East Coast music scene or through his work as a carpenter. Laurie is one of the most down to earth, fun-loving guys you will ever meet! Always smiling and making friends where ever he goes. In 2015 Laurie was diagnosed with a Stage 3 melanoma on his left calf. He had surgery to remove the melanoma, followed by a full lymph node dissection of his left groin. Laurie approached his melanoma diagnosis with the courageous and positive attitude that he is known for. He was able to return to work in 2016 and has had clear scans since. On Wednesday the 29th of August 2018, concerning symptoms led to a CT scan of Laurie’s head which revealed the devastating news that he had a large mass in his brain. Given his medical history Doctors immediately suspected that the mass was a secondary melanoma. He was transferred to the RPA in Sydney and underwent a craniotomy to remove the mass on Friday the 31st of August. Laurie’s operation went well and he was out of ICU within two days. On the ward Laurie quickly  began befriending other patients, their families and staff. Despite his own situation, Laurie spent the majority of his time in hospital cheering up others. Laurie and his family are very grateful for the wonderful care that he received during his stay at the RPA. Like any surgery a craniotomy carries serious risks and the speed of Laurie’s recovery astounded even his Neurosurgical team. However, sadly it turns out that the surgery was just the beginning of the challenges that lay ahead.The mass was not a metastatic melanoma as first suspected, it was a primary brain tumour. Worse still, it was a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive cancer that begins within the brain. Laurie has now started a 6 week course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy at the RPA. But despite these treatments the prognosis for GBM remains poor. Determined not to give up easily Laurie is looking at new treatment options that are currently only available overseas. Whilst promising, overseas treatments are extremely expensive and this combined with everyday living expenses has placed a huge burden on Laurie and his partner Rhianna, who in a cruel twist of fate got the keys to their first home on the same day he was diagnosed! So we are asking for your assistance as Laurie faces his biggest battle yet. Funds raised will go directly towards Laurie’s medical treatments, travel and living expenses. Please share this page so we can gather as much support for Laurie as possible in this time of need. He is a truly remarkable individual who continues to inspire those around him with his amazing strength and positive outlook on life.",8fc1a4bd65aabec864a3461a85e7eb81,26,0.1454,120.0,3,0,melanoma,0,1,0,1,0,0.002053388090349076,0.0,0.8768402154398564,1.2225606657843358,0.0,gofundme

This disease is not reversible and makes her breathing very hard, she has to use a machine to help her breath all the time. Her cough is really bad too, she can cough continuously for one hour or two, even she is not eating anything. Doctor told us her lungs are gonna fail eventually.  Even if we can do a lungs transplant, that requires her to be cancer free for 2 years, which is almost impossible for her to wait that long.Our Difficulties:Mom has been a full time caregiver for my little one, we still have to take care of our first daughter, I am not sure what she will deal with this since we will probably have to face to worst result -- losing our second daughter. The doctors are suggesting we talk to her school and give her some pre consultant in advance. I, had a full time job, working in a limo company, now had talked to my boss, I have to spend more time with my family, since she only has limited time, I can not come to work at all. All the family income will be from the two rooms rent we share on Airbnb.

I have never heard about this disease before, but after the doctor told me, the whole family was put in a great pain. The doctor said they would do their best, but from the past, the survival rate is about 50%-60%.I brought my wife and 2 daughters all the way from China at the end of 2014. We were just trying to settle down here. I believe our life is going to be better and better. But now I have to stop everything, being in the hospital with my cute daughter, I hope she will be cured and grow up healthy, there are a lot of things I want to do with her.According to the doctor, we have to do 5 cycles of chemo and then we are expecting to see the tumor going smaller, then the doctor would be able to remove it from her belly by an operation, then she has to do another cycle of chemo. After that, she would have to do 2 times of transfusion, if everything is going fine, she would do around 6 cycles of maintenance therapy, the whole treatment is gonna be over a year.We are now in Children's Hospital Oakland for 20 days. Me and mom are taking turns to care her. She is a strong girl, she was talking to me she wanted to go out and play, but her leg was having cast, because of her bone fracture, I was trying to comfort her, so I talked to her "" we can go boating, or go climbing hills, or just go to the park when you get well"", she was responding me with her cutest voice, and I can see my wife is wiping her tears.My parents and other relatives are still back in China. I am working on the paperwork for them so they can apply for a visa, so they can come to visit my daughter.

Doctors said I wouldnt live to see 38 & if I did I would be in a wheelchair.  I have fought so hard not to make that a reality. With this disease you usually have a tumor on your pituitary in the brain or adrenal glands. In my case they could not find the tumor and after 5 months in hospital dying & due to the excessive amount of cortisol my body was producing had to remove both adrenal glands in order to survive while searching for tumor. Currently I am enrolled in a government research program at The National Institue of Health in Bethesda MD where I go often for treatment. In between visits to the NIH I drive a 2hr trip to Nashville each direction every few weeks to  see my endocrinologist & a few other specialists. A few weeks ago while at a 2 week stay at NIH they  not only found the tumor but several of them in the lymph nodes around the trachea & in the lungs. A biopsy has turned up 2 different types of cancer. One metastatic & the other neuro ectopic cancer . After researching several oncologist I found one at NY Presbyterian willing to treat me so now being treated at NY Presbyterian in hopes to be able to remove cancerous tumors & beat this horrific diagnosis. Currently I just underwent my first serious of surgery at NY Presbyterian removing all cancerous lymph nodes in right side of lungs. They are hopeful it was sucessful.  In a few  weeks i will undergo same procedure in left side in hopes to remove all cAncer. Unfortunately after removing 52 lymph nodes and 28 positive tumors from lungs and aorta the cancer spread back within 6 months. I continue to search for treatments in mutilple states so I can live and be a mom to my kids but at this point totally unsuccessful. without adrenal glands my life is at risk daily. I underwent 7 months of chemo which nearly killed me and this was only in hopes to slow the cancer as it is not curable. This  illness has disabled me & I have not been able to work in over 6 yrs.  However, I am grateful to still be alive & to have learned how to walk again, my health keeps deteriorating & Expenses to travel for treatments have become overwhelming & making it difficult to maintain household expenses & take care of my children while living off social security.  The past 6 yrs  has exhausted my savings,credit cards, 401k, sold all valuables & even designed my own shirts to bring awareness to this rare cancer and help raise money for the continued overwhelming treatment expenses . I have never been a person to ask for help from anyone but at th point I cannot continue to fight my battle without help.  I am forever grateful to any & all who support me as I continue to fight to win this ongoing battle which we know is incurable and help me continue to be a mom to my kids while I’m still able.",e6f34fb828f0e8fcb957d0e6671a6978,24,0.29868,1380.0,6,1,general,0,7,0,5,0,0.011904761904761904,0.0,0.06431273644388398,10.214260091079211,0.0,gofundme

Ashley is a 26-year-old single mother of a beautiful one-year-old girl, Natalie Ann. Shortly after Natalie's first birthday, Ashley suffered a seizure which led to the discovery of a tumor in the frontal lobe of her brain. Within a few days, Ashley underwent surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. Due to the location of the tumor, only about 70% was successfully able to be removed. Shortly thereafter, a biopsy revealed a devastating diagnosis. The tumor was determined to be a Stage IV Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive type of cancer that can begin within the brain. There is no cure for GBM. In order to slow the growth of the tumor and maximize Ashley's time with her daughter, she is set to begin chemo and radiation this week.Ashley has always given of herself, family being her number one priority since childhood. Recently, she set aside her career to help care for her mother who suffers from a form of muscular dystrophy.  Having Natalie has brought a light to their lives that had been missing for so long. Everyone who knows Ashley knew that she would be a great mother, but since the day Natalie Ann was born, there has been a light in Ashley's eyes that I've never seen before.  She was  meant to be this little girls mommy and all Ashley wants to do right now is spend as much time as possible with her baby girl.I'm asking anyone and everyone to please consider donating whatever you can to help this family focus on what's most important, not wondering how they're going to afford the next medical bill that comes their way.

And imagine you have a gorgeous and happy 9 year old daughter. One day she gets sick, doctors inform you that your little girl is seriously sick and that she has - Acute Myeloid Leukemia. How would you feel, what would you do... And that is exactly what happened to our little Teodora. By the April 2016, Teodora was a healthy child, who spent time playing with her school friends and her little brother Djordje. But slowly she start becoming too tired and the pain in her legs were enabling her to play or attend school. She began to fade, the disease was taking over…And then the first analysis were completed, it was Acute Myeloid Leukemia. AML is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that build up in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. Since May 2016, Teodora`s parents and doctors at the Institute ""Dr Vukan Cupic"" in Belgrade began the relentless battle for Teodora`s life. She is just a little girl with the severe disease that has undergone exhausting aggressive therapy - five cycles of chemotherapy, where many complications prevented the desired results.This type of cancer is difficult to cure and the only way Teodora could be saved is a Bone Marrow Transplantation. The only hospital that can complete this procedure, to replace damaged or destroyed bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells is the Children’s Hospital in Frankfurt, Germany. The cost for this procedure is 350,000 euros.Teodora`s dad, Bogdan, says: ""My wife and I work in the media and we wouldn`t be able to earn this amount of money if we were to live our three lives! That much money, we simply don`t have, not even close to that. But we have no rights to give up the fight for the life of our Teodora, as she struggles to win this battle like the greatest warrior. The boundless love for our child we have, as any other parent in this world, gives us the strength to push, hope and believe that with the help of good people, institutions, agencies, companies - we will be able to collect the necessary 350,000 euros” Teodora`s situation is getting worse every day.

In just a matter of weeks our sweet, energetic, smiley young baby boy could barely walk or sit up for very long and had begun to look very sick and very sad. Our daughter Zoe, age 3, didn’t understand why her brother wouldn’t play anymore.We were immediately being sent to the local ER for testing. They said something was very wrong with his blood, his hemoglobin was 2.5, the doctor said he had never seen any person that low, he was barely alive. He began transfusions immediately while waiting for transport to the nearest children’s hospital and a hematologist/oncologist who would meet us in the Pediatric ICU where Dakota would have to remain until stable.We were transferred to the PICU at Palm Beach Children’s Hospital where we remained for 4 days. By the end of our stay in PICU, he had received 6 blood transfusions, 2 platelet transfusions, had a bone marrow biopsy, 2 lumbar punctures and a port had to be surgically implanted in chest wall. Dakota was diagnosed that Thursday with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).  They said his bone marrow was 75% leukemia cells and that the pressure they cause on his bones from the inside out meant our little boy had been in unbearable pain.  He began receiving chemo and we remained in the hospital for the next two weeks.Our Doctors have told us that his treatment will be at least a three year full time treatment plan that will include chemotherapy at home and in clinic, inpatient hospital stays and a lot of changes to our home and to Dakota and our family’s every day lives.  While we are hoping that our  insurance will cover a good portion of Dakota’s medical expenses, the reality is we aren't sure how much will be covered and the bills are already starting to pile up less than a month into his treatment.  There are other uncovered costs like his daily medications, special dietary changes, and changes we have to make in our home during his three year long treatment.  As his main care provider I will also not be able to return to work. We love our son very much and just want him to get better and will do whatever it takes to make that happen.

Something that no mother, father, grandmother, aunt or family member ever wants to hear about a precious loved one is that they have been diagnosed with cancer. Yesterday we got the dreadful news that our precious little baby boy of our family, my 6 yr old grandson, has been diagnosed with Leukemia. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. While away on vacation visiting his grandmother in Minnesota he became ill and was taken to the emergency room. At first they thought it was his kidneys or liver and then found the swollen lymph nodes under his arms and thought it may be Leukemia. They ran bloodwork and his hemoglobin level was at an alarming 4 which is near fatal levels and they immediately transported him to children's hospital Minneapolis and began transfusions and confirmed in fact that it was Leukemia. Our family is devastated and I cannot begin to fathom how my daughter and Christian's father are feeling at this time. Our hearts break for them and for little Christian and the road that they are going to have before them in battling this cancer. I am asking that anyone and everyone please pray for my family and if you feel it upon your heart to donate to help the family pay for some of the costs that will be incurred and the loss of income that will happen because of the time needed for them to spend with their son, please donate.

First of all, thank you for taking the time to read her story.  Kara has been fighting Leukemia for over 2 years and currently in remission. We just found out September 19th, that she has GVHD in her lungs. This has to be treated  because this can be mild, moderate, severe, or even life threatening. She's had a chronic cough for 3 months, trouble breathing and she is only 37 years old on oxygen 24/7 along with other medications. Her insurance company denied a prescription after the doctor tried to appeal it 2 times. Her only option is to fly out to Washington D.C. in mid October to enroll in a clinical study and start a trial medication that is similar to the one originally recommended. Due to the importance and severity of her health, I am sharing her story in hopes to help with all of the unknown expenses to make this happen because this was a last minute plan of action ordered by her Oncologist. I would love for Kara to be able to go and get the medical treatment that she needs so she can enjoy life again and be with her 2 children that need her. I met Kara Crawford in 8th grade, she says 7th! We have been best friends for 20+ years so I call her my sister. I remember when she came over to my house and told me she was moving to Newnan to be with Stevie, her current husband. For selfish reasons, I was devastated because we had so much fun together and we were together all the time, living the carefree days. GOOD TIMES! GREAT MEMORIES! She moved out of Gwinnett when she was 22 and started her new chapter in life. We spoke off and on throughout the years but LIFE gets busy, the years flew by, and we grew apart but spoke very sporadic.Kara is 37 years old and has been married to Stevie for about 15 years. They have two children who are so sweet, smart and super precious. Their daughter is Lexi who is 13, and their son Kevin who is 9. Kara is also a stepmom of three who are Steven, Brook, and Molly. She entered their lives when they were younger. She has always loved and cared for them just as much as her own. Beautiful family all together. Kara is one strong lady but her Faith in GOD has truly helped her stay strong and focused on the having positive thoughts. On March 26, 2014, I got a call from Kara with the most unexpected news that was not the news anyone would want to hear. She was very calm but she said,  I have Cancer...Leukemia which is Acute Myelogneous Leukemia. It is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow with excess immature white blood cells. I think I was in shock when I found out, I never expected to hear anything like that. My first thought was I would not wish this on anyone but I certainly didn't wish it on ""Carebear."" I drove to Emory University Hospital that day to see her. She started Chemotherapy right away along with a trial chemo medication. She was started on new medications that would help with prevention of any infection because of her immune system. She was so strong every single day. She's always smiling, maintaining a positive mindset, and she has truly been a fighter. Around flu season of 2014, she did stay at Emory for a period of time to avoid any risks of infection during treatment. I would come down for days and we would have slumber parties in her room there and we reminised on our past, talked for hours sharing stories about our cheerleading days, spring break trips, old boyfriends, shopping every Saturday for a new outfit for Saturday night, our club scene night and so much more. GOOD TIMES!!!Kara had her first relapse in January, 2015. She went through the process of  getting set up her first stem cell transplant. This was done on April 21, 2015. Her sister Amy was her donor. It was such a blessing that Amy was a match and was able to go through the process to help her little sis out in such a HUGE way. They both did great after the procedure. Later in the year, Kara had another setback in September, 2015. She started chemo treatments again from Sept-Jan. She was back in remission on January 4th, 2016 which was on her brother and maternal grandfathers birthday. She just kept going strong. She had a second mini transplant (little boost of her sisters cells) known as DLI in Febuary, 2016. Kara has had some side effects to the chemotherapy, medications, and infusions. If you saw her, you would not know that she has been fighting Leukemia for over two years because she is going at 110 mph every day UNLESS she was in the hospital. She wakes up early every morning and has her routine. She gets her two children ready for school, packs their lunches, drives them to school, does the shopping, laundry, cooking, helps with homework, brings them to their sporting events, church, birthday parties etc. She takes care of the household while Stevie is at work. She has tackled all of that and so much more while going to her doctor appointments and trying to stay well. It is absolutely ADMIRABLE and UNBELIEVABLE how much she does daily, considering what this illness and the treatments can do to the human body. She is an amazing mom and wife. Luckily her mom, Cathy has been able to fill in when Kara has been in the hospital for long periods of time, to help Stevie out at home.Kara has had GVHD known as Graft-versus-host disease which is commonly associated with bone marrow and stem cell transplants. It started off on her skin in random areas of the body. This past spring/summer, she thought she had conjuntivitis or allergies because her eyes were irritated and her vision was getting worse that she basically could not see. She did see an Opthlamologist and found out it was the GVHD in her eyes and there was a problem with the cornea and had tubes put in her eyes. She was told she would never be able to see again at 100 % without a particular type of contacts. She was referred out, saw a specialist that had the contacts for this condition that will help her see at 20/20 vision again. The contacts costs around $3,000.00 and her insurance denied it. Luckily the office had supporting documents and was able to get the contacts approved and she will be getting those on Friday. Dr. Khoury is her oncologist and he is just phenomincal. He was recently out of the country for about three months and has returned to the states a few weeks ago. She was seeing a different doctor while he was out of the country.  About three months ago, Kara got sick and was diagnosed with Parainfluenza. Since then, she has been on contineuos antibiotics, steroids, inhalers etc. She was not getting better at all. On Sunday evening, September 11th, she went to the ER for the chronic cough x three months and was severely short of breath. She was then admitted for observation and was there for one week. They were treating her for possible Pneumonia or GVHD but did not have a clear diagnosis. They had her on oxygen around the clock and breathing treatments every four hours along with other maintanance medications and new ones. I visited with her a couple of days/nights. One day, the doctor doing rounds came in to check on her. Since they thought the GVHD was in her lungs, he had discussed a plan of trying her on a new medication. We found out that this drug was DEA approved but had not gone through the complete process with the agency, so her insurance company denied the medication. The doctor stated they tried to appeal it at least two times but they still denied the medication. She was released on Sunday, September 18th. She is still on Oxygen 24/7 and is unable to talk much less be active without getting short of breath and a cough that won't stop. With Dr. Khoury being back and seeing his patients, he was on board with Kara's recent findings and plan of action. He had viewed the last two CT scans and he said it was 100 % the GVHD in both lungs. Dr. Khory's office notified her of this on Monday, September 19th. We were at Emory while she was getting her five hour infusion. She saw him today for her follow up and he is referring her to Washington D.C. in mid October for her to be in a clinical trial study for a ""sister"" drug to the one that was originally recommended but denied. Kara is still on the oxygen all day and night along with numerous medications. She is not getting any better.  She is short of breath and has severe coughing with talking, laughing or just a few steps. I have spent a lot of time with her at her home this past week, trying to help out because I was able to and I wanted to. She is having to rest as much as possible. but they do want her to walk around some. She can not take care of her kids or things around the house because she is very sick. She is not supposed to leave her house unless it is for an appointment. I left her house last night and she was exhausted because she is not getting adaquate sleep because of the constant cough and having to take prescriptions at certain times along with the breathing treatments every four hours. Her chest hurts and her body is tired, that is not to mention the side effects to her body from the previous chemo treatments. This girl DOES NOT complain about anything such as pain, side effects from the chemo, infections, or the fact that she has been sick for three months straight and has not got better. She just kept being the great MOM that she is until this last visit in the hospital. I can only imagine how difficult all of this is, the every day stressors, not only feeling good, but it is hard for her for her kids to see her like this.  She has got to out to Washington D.C. in hopes that this trial will be successful. I would love more than anything in this world for anyone out there to just send positive vibes, prayers if you believe, and if you can donate anything to this family in need. This would help tremendously with her expenses for travel, lodging, and food while out there. The study is done in two week cycles up to 8, including follow up visits every six months up to two years. This donation is so important because of the unknown and her being out of state and her husband going when he can, this could help out with their regular bills, her insurance, necessities for her children and misc. I would love to see Kara back home sooner than later by the success of this trial drug working and Kara feeling at 100 % again. I don't want her to stress about anything and I want her to feel better so that she can enjoy her life again and be active with her family.  ***This seems to be the next and possibly only option to treat this. GVHD can be fatal to patients when it gets into the lungs and goes untreated.

However, this all led to additional costs, amounting to $45,000 above what has originally been collected. We are grateful to the many that have already contributed, but are, once again, asking for help and generosity of those and others to help raise $45,000 needed for additional treatment that will cure Miljana. On behalf of Miljana, Vukasin, and Marko Stankovic, thank you for your continued help and support! Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers.Darko Stankovic, Vukasin's uncle.We are initiating this $45,000 campaign through GoFundMe platform, since YouCaring is integrating with GoFundMe and will not accept donations after May 2018 for PayPal accounts originating in Serbia.Nasa borba je pocela u martu prosle godine kada je Miljani Ristic, mladoj mami sedamnaestomesecnog Vukasina, dijagnostikovana akutna mijeloblastna leukemija, izuzetno agresivna i opasna vrsta raka kostane srzi. Zahvaljujuci sugradjanima, prijateljima i svim ljudima dobrog srca, koji su preko noci postali deo nase porodice, prikupljena su novcana sredstva za njeno lecenje u Hammersmith klinici u Londonu. Miljana je sve hemioterapije, kao i samu transplantaciju maticnih celija, podnela hrabro i uz osmeh, i sve je ukazivalo na potpuni oporavak. Nazalost, pre dva meseca njeno stanje se pogorsalo. Lekari su prvo otkrili infekciju na plucima i jetri, da bi ubrzo nakon toga konstatovali povratak bolesti.

On October 24th Pat was diagnosed with Acute myeloid leukemia (a fast moving form of leukemia) after rigorous testing. Then finding out this heartbreaking news the family was determined it would be treatable. A specialist preformed a bone marrow test which was then sent to an Oncologist in Prince George and Vancouver. Pat and Brenda (Pat's wife), were told on October 27th that this form was not treatable by the doctor. The tests determined it was terminal and deamed untreatable. Pat was given three to six months to live. Within the first month of knowing his white blood cells decreased tremendously which left his immune system depleted, leaving him highly vulnerable to infections. He started using natural immunity boosters which on his next blood tests appeared to sustain his white blood cell count. Pat and Brenda were informed of the CIPAG Clinic and of Dr. Castillo in Tijuana Mexico. Following up on this clinic via web, they began emailing back and forth with the clinic. They decided to follow through. Within a week (shortly before christmas) after emails and phone calls they set a cosultation date for January 3rd 2017.

Our once energetic, athletic and lively girl, was now lethargic, unable to walk more than a short distance, and constantly complaining that she didn't want to do anything. Immediately after the blood tests were complete, the urgent care doctor told me that things did not look good for Kailyn. She was below critically anemic, her white blood cell count was astronomically high, her platelets were dangerously low, and that she likely had lekemia. He insisted that we immediately make the drive to LAMC Kaiser to get her treatment started right away. Once there we were greeted with doctors explaining that she would be getting two blood transfusions and three platelet transfusions overnight and would have a procedure in the morning. The next day Kailyn underwent a bone marrow biopsy, a lumbar puncture, the placement of her PICC line and the first dose of chemo. Kailyn was then formally diagnosed with ""High-Risk B-Cell  Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)."" Soon after the procedure she began her first full chemo treatment. From what doctors and nurses have told us, this looks to be at least a three year journey full of treatment, doctor's appoinments, chemotherapy, and all around changes in Kailyn's everyday life. While we hope that the majority of her medical care should be covered by insurance, we will still have to find a way to pay the pharmacy charges for her daily cocktail of medication, the price of driving to and from Los Angeles at least on a weekly basis (if not more), and also making sure that Kailyn always has access to the freshest food at home (since we won't be able to go in public for a long while).  With these costs already beginning to pile up, we just hope that you understand that any amount given is sooo greatly appreciated on this fight to beat Leukemia!!   We also plan to do some updates through this platform!",9cdc76d602ed810009386c79577faece,13,1.13006,600.0,6,1,leukemia,1,2,1,2,1,0.005780346820809248,0.002890173410404624,0.6253776435045317,2.727968671837326,1.0,gofundme

My name is Pauline and I am starting a gofundme campaign for my youngest sister Charlene. At the age of 25 Charlene was diagnosed with Acute Leukemia. She immediately began chemotherapy and to our pleasant surprise went into remission. Unfortunately our celebrating was short lived. 24 hours after discharge Charlene had 2 brain clots and had a stroke (one of the side effects of chemo is blood clotting). She immediately underwent surgery and was put into an induced coma. The doctors were preparing us for the worse. Thankfully two months into the coma Charlene slowly started waking up. We soon realized that the stroke mostly affected her motor skills. The progress Charlene has made over the months is truly remarkable. After her release from St. Barnabos Hospital she was transferred to Kessler Institute in NJ. At Kessler she was taken off her feeding tube, breathing tube, and began intensive rehab. Kessler’s services were outstanding and helped Charlene regain some arm movement and leg movement. It’s so heartwarming seeing Charlene use her arms. She has learned how to comb her hair, brush her teeth, feed herself, and work her tablet! Her main goal now is to someday walk……….nothing would make our family happier than to see her walk one day. Due to health insurance policies and funding she had to leave Kessler and was transferred to a short term Nursing Home. Due to lack of staff and funding she was not getting the proper physical therapy that she needed to accomplish her goals.We received devastating news on March 29, 2016, that Charlene’s leukemia was progressive again. She was immediately admitted in the hospital and is now undergoing treatment, BLINCYTO. She is also on a waiting list for a bone marrow transplant. It’s been 5 days since she started her second round of treatment and so far her levels are going up, which is positive!Once Charlene is in remission she will again need additional rehab at a short term nursing home. Once treatment is fulfilled she will need proper equipment in order to be released and live with our mom. Currently, Charlene is still not able to walk and subsequently not able to work. She requires full attention as she is not able to properly take care of herself and still requires personal care and is now receiving additional treatment for her leukemia. This GoFund me Campaign will help raise money for the following: TRAM mobile lift to transport Charlene from a bed to a wheelchair, special ramps, additional physical therapy that her health insurance does not cover, and help towards the cost of medical bills which is now well over $30,000.

She needs our help to heal.Pearl's fight to beating cancer began in April 2014. She was living in Dutch Harbor, Alaska, a remote island in the Bering Sea, where she worked as a Fisheries Biologist. Pearl woke up one morning with a terrible headache but tried to ignore it. She headed to the gym to stick to her healthy routine and by the time she got there, she was winded. Once inside, she stepped onto a treadmill but felt like she’d pass out; she went home. When she didn’t feel better later that day, she went to a local clinic to figure out what was wrong. Blood tests showed she was dangerously anemic and had an extremely low platelet count. Pearl needed an immediate blood transfusion to survive which is not available on the island.Within 45 minutes of the results, friends had packed her a bag and Pearl was on a medical flight to Anchorage for an emergency blood transfusion. In Anchorage, doctors told her the reason why she was so sick—she had leukemia. She needed immediate treatment.Hours later, she was airlifted again, from Anchorage to Seattle and then finally to her hometown of San Diego. The road to recovery was long and hard: doses of chemotherapy, months in intensive care, blood transfusion after blood transfusion. Fortunately, her brother was a match to donate bone marrow and Pearl is extremely tough. After a year of treatment, she beat cancer. The leukemia went into remission and by September 2015 she was healthy enough to return to work. Her position was relocated to the Seattle office so that she could continue to be monitored by specialists.Beating cancer is expensive, and over the course of more than a year, Pearl had depleted her savings and then some. But as a testament to her character, she became an advocate for raising money for others experiencing similar financial issues. When she returned to work she became an integral member of a team for the “Combined Federal Campaign,” a philanthropy program that allows federal employees to pledge a percentage of income to eligible charity programs. In a matter of months, Pearl's group raised over $50,000. Pearl always puts others before herself.In March 2016, Pearl was offered the opportunity to return to Dutch Harbor for a couple weeks of fieldwork in April. She was elated, two years from the date she could return to where it began; a real milestone to overcoming cancer. On March 8th 2016, Pearl was at a routine check-up, anxious to get the green light from her oncologist to go to Alaska. But then, she saw her blood work, her heart sunk. More tests were ordered and a week later, she learned the leukemia had relapsed. Pearl will be starting chemotherapy immediately. She decided to receive care in Seattle because of the world class doctors available. Her treatment is complicated by the fact her brother can’t be a bone marrow donor again. Her mom took leave from work and flew up to be her full-time caregiver. They need our help, prayers and support.Please donate to help relieve some of the financial burden associated with cancer.

Growing up in a Cuban family, you learn to love your cousins as siblings. My fiancé, Danny, is an only child, so Yordis is like a brother to him. He helped bring him & his wife from Cuba almost 7 years ago so they could live the American dream like the rest of us. Just last year they were finally able to save enough to buy their first home. Just over a month ago, we were all struck with the most unexpected & unimaginable news. On February 23, 2018 he went to the hospital with horrible abdominal pain, only to be diagnosed with a rare and aggressive kind of leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Under the care of an exceptional team of oncologists, within a few days he began the 6-week course of induction chemotherapy. After approximately 3-4 weeks, he developed a coagulation problem, medically termed D.I.C. (or disseminated intravascular coagulation). In short, the body enters a state of rapid coagulation, where blood clots form throughout the body’s small blood vessels and can damage multiple organs. As the body’s coagulation factors and platelets are used up, less of them are available throughout the body and serious bleeding can occur. Luckily with rapid and extensive treatment, doctors were able to stabilize him, with some complications along the way. Unfortunately, his white blood cell count did not respond to the first round of chemotherapy as anticipated, so a second protocol was attempted & fortunately his body responded! With heavy doses of chemotherapy, came significant weight loss, weakness, vomiting, etc. Nonetheless, he is a true champ and has endured the past few weeks and stayed strong. Currently he is undergoing continued chemotherapy and being prepped for a bone marrow transplant. A transplant is the only way to potentially cure the disease and save his life. The procedure is very expensive and his wife has been fortunate enough to be able to stay by his side throughout the process so far. However, they are in need of ongoing financial support to continue the battle and fight this! We need your help. Any little bit counts & I promise to keep all those who donate updated. Thanks on behalf of our entire family. We will not give up & with faith & hope we know we can fight this!

Al crecer en una familia Cubana, aprendes a amar a tus primos como hermanos. Mi prometido, Danny, es único hijo, por lo cual Yordis es como un hermano para él. Él ayudó a traerlo a él y a su esposa de Cuba hace casi 7 años para que pudieran vivir el sueño americano como el resto de nosotros. El año pasado finalmente pudieron ahorrar suficiente para comprar su primera casa. Hace poco más de un mes, todos nos sorprendimos con la noticias más inesperada e inimaginable.El 23 de febrero del 2018 ingresó en el hospital con un horrible dolor abdominal, solo para ser diagnosticado con un tipo raro y agresivo de leucemia, leucemia / linfoma de células T adultas. Bajo el cuidado de un equipo excepcional de oncólogos, a los pocos días comenzó el curso de 6 semanas de quimioterapia de inducción. Después de aproximadamente 3-4 semanas, desarrolló un problema de coagulación, médicamente denominado D.I.C. (o coagulación intravascular diseminada). En resumen, el cuerpo entra en un estado de coagulación rápida, donde los coágulos sanguíneos se forman a través de los vasos sanguíneos pequeños del cuerpo y pueden dañar múltiples órganos. A medida que se agotan los factores de coagulación y las plaquetas del cuerpo, hay menos de ellos disponibles en todo el cuerpo y se puede presentar una hemorragia grave. Afortunadamente, con un tratamiento rápido y extenso, los médicos pudieron estabilizarlo, con algunas complicaciones en el camino. Desafortunadamente, su cuenta de glóbulos blancos no respondió a la primera ronda de quimioterapia como se esperaba, por lo cual se intentó un segundo protocolo y afortunadamente ¡su cuerpo respondió! Con grandes dosis de quimioterapia, hubo pérdida de peso, debilidad, vómitos, etcétera. Sin embargo, es un verdadero campeón y ha resistido las últimas semanas y se ha mantenido fuerte. Actualmente se somete a quimioterapia continua y se está preparando para un trasplante de médula ósea. Es la única manera de asegurar que se cure de esta enfermedad y lograr salvarle la vida. El procedimiento es muy costoso y su esposa ha tenido la suerte de poder permanecer a su lado durante todo el proceso hasta el momento. Sin embargo, necesitan apoyo financiero continuo para continuar la batalla y luchar contra esto. Necesitamos su ayuda. Cualquier cantidad ayuda y prometo mantener actualizados a todos los que donen.

In 2011, Dave was diagnosed with Melanoma and after several skin graphs, Dave was deemed cancer-free. This August, Dave and his family received the devastating news that the melanoma has since spread throughout his body. When Dave was admitted to the hospital late this summer for what he thought was a chronic migraine, doctors ran several tests, which revealed melanoma tumors on Dave's brain. Doctors also discovered tumors on his lungs, hips, and calfs. To date, Dave has 45 internal Melanoma tumors. Melanoma is considered the most serious type of skin cancer, and although it rarely spreads internally, when it does, treatment is extremely difficult. Dave has been undergoing a combination of Gamma Knife radiology (a more targeted technique than traditional radiation) and immunotherapy, which triggers the immune system to fight any existing cancer cells, for four months. Treatment has been somewhat successful, but the steroids that Dave has been prescribed to reduce his brain's swelling cannot be taken in combination with the drugs administered through his immunotherapy treatments. Without steroids, Dave's health has consistently regressed, so progress through immunotherapy treatment has slowed significantly. Despite the grim prognosis and grueling treatments, Dave's spirits have remained high and his goofy personality largely unchanged. His family and friends, especially his two children, have been a huge source of strength throughout his diagnosis and treatment process. Donations will be put toward medical treatments and expenses and travel between the Whisler's home in Warren and the Cleveland Clinic. The Whisler family is overwhelmed by the support the Howland community and wrestling families from across the state have shown them, and are appreciative from the bottom of their hearts for any donations made on Dave's behalf!",012d00c98eddc7008ead0626187afa72,14,0.7743333333333333,780.0,2,1,mixed,0,1,0,1,0,0.003205128205128205,0.0,0.48234106962663975,1.0,0.0,gofundme

I fall short often, but thankfully I have many positive influences in my world that remind me of who's in charge. My rollercoaster took off on a wild turn and turned me upside down this August with a visit to my dermatologist. Given my skin tone it is not unusual to have things scraped and burned, but I sensed uneasiness with the doctor this time as she scraped one spot on my right thigh, and one on my left foot. I anticipated the follow up call, and often found myself holding my breath when thinking about it. I already knew the news would not be good and it wasn't. Both spots were positive for melanoma and I experienced the feeling of my heart falling out of my chest for the first time. I tried to make sense of how I could possibly have cancer, I mean seriously, I am super healthy and have had a 96% plant based diet for the past three years. Yes, I know there is more to it, but my brain went there. I waited two weeks for a consultation with the Cancer Center, and once the consultation happened I fell fast and furious into the medical world of healing cancer. I was scheduled for surgery so fast it made my head spin. The thigh would be easy, but the foot would require a skin graft to cover the section of my foot they needed to remove. Still spinning upside down. Because of the knowledge I have gained over the years about curing cancer naturally, I struggled with having the surgery. I moved forward with the surgery as I asked God for a sign and he gave it to me. The surgery was in September and all things considered the recovery has been fairly simple. Healing a foot always has its challenges. I hav remained on the emotional ""I have cancer"" rollercoaster, which cannot be described unless you have heard those three words in your lifetime. I anxiously awaited the results of the surgery (that's another story in itself) and just found out last week that they did not get all the cancer. More surgery, more spinning, and while hanging upside down I have been doing tons of cancer research. My life is literally in my hands and that is scary. I have decided to adopt a natural approach against the wishes of many who are not afraid to tell me, and in turn make me even more scared. The one thing is, God is in charge and if I am confident about anything, it's that...but, it's still scary. I am now a member of ""Square One Program"" which is run by Chris Wark of Chris Beat Cancer. I am excited about the support and the easy to follow day-by-day plan. There are many purchases I need to make and thought I had it covered with a side job in Nov & Dec that paid very generously. I just found out that will not happen and so the twists and turns keep turning. I need money to purchase things like supplements, apricot kernels, coffee enemas, mushroom powder, shower filter, essential oils, apricot kernels, hyperbaric oxygen treatments, aloe vera juice, teas, and many more things that I need to purchase as soon as possible. My diet is golden but I need to support my immune system quickly. I felt defeated on Friday and God showed up again and said there was another way. Go Fund Me has not left my head since. This is way out of my comfort zone, but I am being guided that creating this page is part of the healing process. I appreciate any donation you are able to make so I can start incorporating the things I need ASAP to cure melanoma my way. Please leave your address so I can mail a thank you card.

The cancer at that time had been located  in 4 separate areas of his body.  As so many families know stage 4 Melanoma is the worst stage of Melanoma and more often than not comes with a 6 month life expectancy.   Since my original post over a year ago, David has beat the odds and fought so very hard and battled through brain surgery to remove one of his tumors, along with full brain cyberknife radiation, as well as, daily chemo.  Through all of this David has never complained, he just continues to play the cards that are being dealt and presses on. Continuing to be a complete ROCK STAR in my opinion!   However, we are now past the famous ""waiting game"" of treatments. Yesterday David received his latest MRI results and revealing our biggest fear that once again there are areas of new growth in the brain and was told he was going to be sent home with hospice.   After talking through all the options with the Dr. and medical team at Winship Emory the decision was made that in order to truly fight for any remaining quality of life, he will be the 3rd person to undergo a 2nd round of full brain cyberknife radiation.   Although we know this round of treatment will be a harder road the 2nd time through we still have the hope that his body will react to the treatment in the best and most effective way possible in order to fight against this cancer.    However, we all know life DOES NOT just stop because a loved one gets sick (and by the way I HATE CANCER) the last thing they need to worry with during this time is how they are going to pay the rent; or put food on the table or more importantly how they will pay for the expenses of travel and treatment costs?""   I have decided to restart this fundraiser campaign in hopes to help offset just a little of the day-to-day financial challenges that I know they will be facing as a family. Even if $10.00 is all you can manage to share with them, that's $10 to help get them into Atlanta for treatment and follow-ups The one thing that we do know is that God is still in the miracle and healing business and our Hope remains in him, once again through this journey.   I know that I have many calloused kneed friends out there that will be praying fervently for his healing and I ask to please pray specifically that God meets every need as they arise. Please know that I along with so many others are so very grateful and completely humbled for every blessing offered up on their behalf during this newly continued journey. I personally thank you so much from the deepest depths of my heart...In Christ,Pam Sapp (Rock Stars Sister in law)",19406cbce2742ac49c8d1fc09453973d,16,0.313,540.0,5,1,melanoma,0,4,2,3,1,0.007858546168958742,0.003929273084479371,0.14380530973451328,8.622514975013123,2.0,gofundme

Brandon is 29 years old. He is a beautiful person inside and out! He is always the life of the party, full of laughter and love and never a dull moment when he's around. He is one, that will absolutely drop anything to help whoever is in need. He is a husband to his wife Nikki of 6 years. A father to their very humble son, Ryder 8 yrs and their two beautiful daughters Rilyn 3 yrs and Roper 2yrs. He has touched the life of so many. Brandon was diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer, September 2009. It began as a spot on his right bicep. After two surgeries, the doctors in Baton Rouge, felt confident they removed all of it. Brandon did interferon as preventative and everything seemed okay at the time. December 2012, he went for a checkup, that he had been neglecting to go to. After a series of test, we learned on February 4, 2013 a day after Roper, his youngest daughter was born, they had seen something in his liver and lung. The mixed emotions between the arrival of our beautiful, healthy baby girl, to the phone call in parking lot at the hospital our emotions were running deep, but our faith got stronger. The next step was to do more in depth testing and biopsies.It was at this time, it was discovered, that he had a golf ball size tumor in the lower section of his left lung and two golf ball size Tumors in his liver. We came to MD Anderson March of 2013. Where he qualified for a clinical trial and began treatment in the same month. The tumors began responding and started shrinking. Everything was going well. Thanksgiving 2013, we began noticing slight problems with Brandon and the left side of his body.  We went to our local ER, where they did a CT.  The CT showed tumors in his brain.  We drove to Houston. Where we were informed he had 15 tumors on his brain. The biggest one was causing the problems on the left side of his body.  He received 10 rounds of whole brain radiation. He was doing well, so they sent him home, with new chemo pills he could take everyday. August 2014, we returned to MD Anderson for a checkup, and that's when we found out the biggest tumor was growing again. Doctors recommend gamma knife radiation, which is directed into the new growth. The tumor shrank. February 2015, we learned Brandon had something called radiation necrosis. It causes swelling and inflammation. He was put on steroids and they seemed to help for a while. A couple weeks later, he began falling and we believe he started having seizures. On March 24, 2015, he had an episode of weakness on his left side. We contacted his neurosurgeon and was told to return to Houston. The next day we arrived at MD Anderson, where he had more test ran.  The necrosis was worse and there was bleeding in his brain. The next best thing was to have surgery. On March 30, 2015 Brandon underwent brain surgery. The doctor removed what he could safely, of the necrosis, blood, and tumor.  After surgery Brandon was doing good. He couldn't move his left arm, but was up, talking, and making everyone laugh like always. A couple days later Brandon started having bad headaches that could not be handled by medication. Apparently, it was the swelling causing the bad headaches, because after they gave him a higher dose of steroids, and then them weaning it to a lower dose seem to help. He was weaker but doing good. The doctors believed he was ready for therapy, so he started therapy.The first full day of therapy he was having bad headaches again and couldn't focus. Finally the doctors decided to do an EEG and CT. The EEG showed he was having seizures. At some point he had stopped receiving his seizure medicine and the swelling had started again. He went to ICU for a few days, then back to a room. As of April 19, 2015 Brandon took a turn for the worse. He was moved from his room back to ICU, with fluid on his brain, the necrosis and tumor has started to put pressure on the good side of his brain.  As 5:20p.m. April 19, 2015 he is resting. Brandon is loved by so many people! Our God is AMAZING and he works miracles! Please keep our sweet Brandon in yalls prayers. I will continue to update as we find out. God bless!                                                                                                                  The last picture is a shadow. It's a cross that was on the wall of Brandon's room the morning of surgery.

With that being said they haven't had an easy road these past few years, but even then they have persisted, and continued to be nothing short of incredible. Now please take a moment to read about their journey right from Cory. 

The Crawfords and their story:""For those that may not know, my wife, Julie Crawford has fought an extended battle with Melanoma for the last 4 1/2 years.  Julie is the love of my life, my high school sweetheart, and mother to our amazing son Adam who turned 6 in March. Julie and I have been together for longer than we have been apart, nearly 19 years.  We never thought, ever, that we would face something like Cancer in our young lives.  The world thought differently and in Nov of 2010 at the age of 29 Julie was diagnosed with  stage 3+ Melanoma. After having what was assumed by her Doctors to be a harmless scar removed from her right arm, the diagnosis was delivered.  Nothing rocks a young families world like hearing some of the things we heard during that period.  Over the following weeks/months Julie went through several invasive surgeries as they first removed the rest of the major tumour and we then learned that cancer had also spread to the lymph nodes.  In all there would be 5 significant surgeries (along with a number of biopsies) performed in the area over the next three years as the Cancer continued to reoccur.  The cancer would eventually be determined as inoperable due to it's growing proximity to major nerves in Sept of 2013. In addition to surgeries over the years Julie has been through a number of drug and non drug treatments.  She has been through Radiation as well as 5 separate drug treatments, a cumulative effect of 145 weeks of being enrolled in scheduled treatments along with countless IVs, cat scans, blood work, pet scans, the list goes on. On March 16th of this year we would learn that the cancer had spread to Julie's lungs. Through all of this Julie has showed unbelievable bravery and strength.  It is a rare occasion that she doesn't still have a smile on her face despite everything she has been through, and it has not been an easy road.  This experience has formed and ruined relationships, has brought us closer to some and pushed us further from others.  There have been times of more support than we needed and times where there never seemed to be enough.  We have been tested as a family but we have persevered.The next phase of Julie's treatment will be what is called an adoptive T-cell transfer.  Unfortunately there is only one place in Canada where this treatment is possible and that is the Princess Margret Hospital in Toronto Ontario.  We know for sure that we will need to make at least two extended trips to Toronto that will add up to several weeks for this treatment, once we begin it could be more. ""

To the point of the matter:Julie and Cory along with their son Adam have been on a long road together so far, with so many up's and downs that road has been more of a rollercoaster than anything, but throughout the years they still remained their amazing selves and such good friends rarely asking for anything. 

With the extended trips and T-cell treatment in Toronto costs will add up, this is a given,  so I ask you on their behalf to open your hearts to this wonderful family and help people who have always been helping others. Any little bit helps and is always appricaited. 

If the amount raised ends up exceeding what the Crawfords expenses ultimately end up being out in Toronto Cory has stated than any extra funds will be donated and will be split between Young Adults Cancer Canada (YACC) and Survive and Thrive.

This was a rip in all of our hearts (family and friends) to hear the news that our 20 year old beautiful , loving daugter has cancer.  By the time it was found the melanoma was Stage 4.  Once the melanoma spreads it is stage 4.  At this time, we did not know what to do, couldn't figure out why and how do we stay strong.We started her immuno therapy in November and had the second treatment in December.  Her pain never got any better after the treatments.  She was in the hospital after the first treatment and released for the second treatment.  After the second treatment she was readmitted into the hospital a couple days later and never left again.  The second treatment was December 14, 2015 and she passed away January 5,2016. Now, we are in the process of starting a not for profit in her name to support all types of Melanoma.  Our aim is to :  1.  Educate everyone in the communities about various types of melanoma, ways to prevent or reduce risks and to get checked.2.  To fund research of medicine, treatments and preventitive maintenance for Melanoma.3.  To assist families during this rough time.  Help with counseling and funding to help reduce the costs associated with medicine and treatments.4.  To award scholarships to students that show dedication in the community and school to educate about Melanoma.  Students that demonstrate outstanding courage under adverse conditions and to always stand up and be brave. This is a foundation in the works.  We are choosing the name, in honor of BAILEY GEORGE.  The word project at the end because of our long term personal initiative to fund research and to educate communites about Melanoma. We want to reduce the risks, save lives and maybe one day rid the world of this horrible disease.According to cancer.org about 76,380 melanomas will be diagnosed in 2016.  About 10,130 people are expected to die from melanoma.  Melanoma is the most common cancer in young adults.  If caught early enough survival rates are 92% for 5 years.  We need to help educate everyone about this horrible disease while we find better ways to prevent and cure because melanoma cases are on the rise and fast.  As a family that went through this terrible tragedy our LOVE for Bailey has now turned into a passion and dedication to help save as many lives as we can now and in the future.  We are going through all the proper channels of lawyers and paperwork to get our tax numbers and exempt status.  The donations will help with lawyers, website designers and costs to start educating everyone with pamphlets and many opportunites to hold fundraisers to find individuals affected with terrible disease.  Any help will be greatly appreciated and we plan to continue to post updates as we move forward.  Thank you for taking the time to read our story.FLY HIGH BAILEY AND GUIDE US ON THIS JOURNEY TO DROP THE ANCHOR ON MELANOMA!!!!!",90f8472233287911a61215853c1c951d,43,0.303125,1050.0,1,1,melanoma,0,0,1,0,1,0.0,0.0013812154696132596,0.9890723652258377,0.0,1.0,gofundme

She has an uphill battle and is determined to fight it with everything she’s got! Since her diagnosis, she has been overwhelmed with endless medical test, imaging, and biopsies. Worse are the chemo treatments. She has had 2 out of the 6 sessions of chemo treatment recommended before her surgery. She recently shaved her head and accepted the lost of her long beautiful black hair. Her motivation is her 5 year old son Patrick. Although Patrick is too young to understand, he is more aware that his fun-loving mother is spending more time at the hospital, but Nguyet, being the person she is, kisses and hugs him everyday and reassure him that “mommy is fine” with a BIG smile. Because of this, she has been unable to work and will likely not be able to for an extended length of time. Some of her medical expenses are not covered by insurance.We need everyone’s help! Let’s show Nguyet some love and help her fight this battle. Nguyet is always cheerful, loving, unbelievably strong and always puts her friends and family before herself. Not only does she deserve to feel special and appreciated, but to keep her selflessness as an untold story would be a disservice to those who haven’t had the privilege of knowing her on a personal level.Her life as an independent beauty artist will be put on hold & her income has abruptly halted. Please partner with us to help her fight this battle against cancer. Anything you can donate will be truly appreciated.  Your financial donations will help offset the financial burdens for fundamental things such as gas to an from copious treatment appointments, food and living costs. She’s not expecting it. But, your financial help will allow her to stay focused on fighting this cancer with the best spirit possible. Please spread the word and help fight this battle with Nguyet!

She is also one of the nicest, most giving, and most deserving people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. Last year Shannon had a major surgery that  resulted in the use of a lot of the sick leave she had. Now, for the last 2 1/2 months, Shannon has been dealing with a lump in her left breast. After getting a mammogram, ultrasound, and a biopsy, she was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (breast cancer). She will now need either a lumpectomy, mastectomy, or double mastectomy depending on the results of the many blood tests she's had.  Her prognostic markers came back as triple negative which means she will have to go through aggressive chemo. She is scheduled for 5 months of chemo treatment right now in hopes that it will reduce the size of her tumor before they perform whichever surgery will be necessary. One of her lymph nodes also tested positive so she will have to have lymphedema therapy after surgery. In the next couple of months, she is looking at hair loss, fatigue, and nausea. She is a strong woman and says she is at peace with the physical healing of her body, but is struggling with the knowledge of what this will mean to her boys.  Her wish is to keep life for them as normal as possible through this process and limit their anxiety. Luckily, she has a long list of people who are more than willing to help her with this wish.Her most immediate need, besides a great number of prayers, is financial support. She's about to bear the financial burden that leave without pay, (while still having to pay her medical insurance each month to avoid loss of coverage) and medical bills will put on her. Her first appointment cost her over $1600 out of pocket and her next doctor's office has already informed her that it will cost her over $600 out of pocket just to put a picc line in for her chemotherapy treatments.Anything you are able to contribute, big or small, is appreciated!

Her daughter, Drew, who is 29 years old,  has just been diagnosed with breast cancer, and her medical bills have already depleted her savings. As she has just started treatment, she has a way to go and needs help.  So I started the GoFundMe page to help.  Drew is a beautiful girl and is trying to be positive through all this.  She has written something, so we can all get to know her and listen to her story:""Buzzzzzzz Bizzzzzzzzz Buzzzzzzippp.The sound of the clippers made a ringing in my ears, with a wicked finality. Locks of my beautiful red hair fell in clumps to the floor as my mother shaved the remaining bits of my head. She tried to keep it together as tears streamed down my face. My crowning glory, the trait that people recognized me by most, was now in a heap on the floor. Just a few short weeks prior, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer.  A shock to my friends and family, and most especially me. I am 29 years old. But to start, you must know that I LOVE my life and I LOVE to laugh. I'm a fiery Texan, and I find humor in dry wit, fun in dressing in my vintage clothing and pin curls, and great joy in a slice of very cheesy pizza. And believe me, I enjoy all those things regularly in my now home base of New York. On top of all of those things, I love my job, a company where I am able to be my best lady-hustler self. Late last fall, the company hosted several cancer awareness events, including a bake-off where the proceeds went to Susan G. Komen. My little pink ribbon sprinkle cookies won the taste test and my company donated to Susan G. Komen in my honor! Following the bake-off, we had a young breast cancer survivor come and tell her story, a harrowing tale by a woman who's about the same age as me and my many under-30 coworkers. I consider myself fully supportive of women's issues (after all, I’m a woman myself!), but neither the bake-off nor the talk seemed to have much true weight at the time. How could they? I was happy and healthy, after all. Something from those events must have subconsciously taken hold though because a few weeks later, I did a self-examination, finding a golf ball size lump. The radiologist couldn’t look me in the face while going over the mammogram. She kept asking, “how old are you?”, in disbelief of what she was seeing on her screen. Though she hadn’t yet said the words, I knew from the look on her face that the diagnosis wasn’t in my favor. Considering the circumstances, it seemed ironic. My company had just donated money to a cause which one day I could potentially be a beneficiary. I just hadn’t known it at the time. How could I, a young woman so happy, have gotten hit by life so hard? It was surreal. Since the diagnosis, the doctors have come up with the plan for chemo first (a whopping 15 treatments!) and surgery later, hoping the chemo will shrink the tumors considerably before I go under the knife. I put on a happy face, but the truth is, the side effects of the treatment are much rougher than I lead on. There is the chronic exhaustion (which has affected my ability to walk around the city I love); I have gotten poked and prodded by more needles than I can count; I had a port implanted into my chest (which upset me to no end to have a scar in a very visible place); I have undergone a series of uncomfortable fertility treatments (who knew chemo could leave you infertile?!); I’ve had a lot of long, tough conversations about things I never thought I would discuss, and of course I’ve lost my beautiful red hair. But no matter how ill or tired I feel, I'm at the office most days, with a big smile on my face, attacking my daily goals like a ninja. Very few acquaitances or people at the office know I have cancer, and I'm proud of that, knowing I can maintain some sense of normalcy and still be perceived as the lady-hustler I always want to be! Plus, a very good auburn wig helps! And my personal life is also full of smiles, with friends and family checking in all the time, bringing over meals, and sending as many Beyonce gifs as possible (because what day isn't made better with a Beyonce gif?!). Despite my many blessings, the fact is I still have cancer, and I very simply need help. Because I have an income, I am not qualified for most financial aid. And while I do have insurance through my job, it only covers a portion of the medical bills, and those medical bills far exceed my income. I’m living a catch-22 where if I were qualified for the aid, I wouldn’t have a job. But because I do have a job, I am able to receive the insurance, which still doesn’t cover many of the bills. I am currently living in between a rock and a hard place. At the moment, I’ve depleted my savings after only the first 3 months of my treatment. With a very long road ahead, the stress of where the funds are coming from to pay the upcoming medical bills is almost as bad as the cancer itself. Thank you to all my friends and family for your love and support, and providing me the courage to speak very publicly about something so private. And thank you to those who take the time to read my story and want to help.

In order to give Christina the option of having a family one day, she will have to undergo in-vitro fertilization and egg freezing. More than anything, we want her to know she can fulfill her dreams of having a family after she gets through this so she can focus on kicking cancer's ass in the meantime.  If we can get her fertility preservation costs covered, any additional funds raised will cover remaining medical expenses. There is no donation too small.  It's amazing how fast it can add up when every pitches in to help.  Please consider making a donation to this beautiful soul who has done so much to help others in her life; it's time now to help her. As her closest friends who love Christina dearly, we cannot thank you enough for any help you're able to offer.  Below is a powerful message from Christina that she wrote just days after finding out about her diagnosis that we wanted to share.  It's a small glimpse into the amazing women's story.   Thank you so much again for any help you can provide.""I've always joked that my cause of death would result from a champagne cork hitting me in the head. Without even realizing it, that little statement perfectly summarized my life-guiding belief in celebrating the big and little achievements for myself and others each day. That appreciation for life and its brevity has led to meaningful career changes which has resulted in clean water efforts in India impacting 200MM people and directing the largest municipal solar program in the Western Hemisphere, solo trips around the world to 20 countries in the past 4 years, and fearlessness and unconditional love when it comes to relationships and having a large and beautiful group of people from all walks of life who inspire me to be better each day.I recently found out there's a different plan for my life that involves a different kind of ""c"" word that unfortunately doesn't involve champagne, and that, my friends, is Cancer. I am 28 years old and have been recently diagnosed with a highly aggressive grade of breast cancer; a diagnosis that's extremely rare for someone my age. I'll be honest. It's been terrifying from the moment of finding a lump in my left breast to going to my initial ultrasound and surgery alone to finding out the results yesterday morning. The waiting. Oh god, the waiting. The heartbreaking call to tell my parents my diagnosis. Throwing up after looking up survival rates. Highlighting and googling all of my clinical reports to decipher the medical terms. Walking out alone after my first ultrasound and crying hysterically in the parking lot. Crying in public more times than I can count. Teaching myself about which tests, procedures, and doctors I need to complete and see ASAP and in what order. Already having memorized every single digit of data on my insurance card. Endless calls to offices to see a surgeon, radiologist, oncologist, and geneticist. Having to start the awful emotional and extremely expensive process of freezing my eggs and wondering if I'll ever have kids. Touching my long hair as often as I can knowing I won't feel as pretty soon after chemo. Missing the normalcy of a simple yet wonderful day filled with homemade coffee, work, exercise, glasses of wine with friends, and curling my hair to get ready for a hot date. And the list goes on.However, here is what doesn't suck. While this cancer is aggressive, it has no idea that when I want something done, I aggressively fight after it until it's done. It has no idea of the tenacity and depth of love and support I have already received from my friends, family, and new support networks (a heart-exploding thank you all for the 200+ calls, voicemails, offers to fly out, cards, gifts, emails, text messages, flowers, and meals delivered so far...it's all so appreciated and forgive me in advance if it takes me time to sift through it all!!!). I have hustled aggressively to seek treatment and second opinions across two of the top cancer treatment centers in Colorado so I can be seen quickly and also by some of the best medical teams in the country; one of which specializes in aggressive forms of breast cancer in women my age. So while I can't honestly say ""I'll be fine"", I am doing the best job humanly possible to make an educated and informed plan of attack.I'll end with this. Guys. I love the absolutely wild and beautiful life I have and I have no plans of stopping anytime soon. But I hope this message can demonstrate (check that, SHOUT AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS) the importance of listening to your body and taking action to take care of yourselves. Please perform regular breast exams and never hesitate to set up a dr. appt to see someone if ANYTHING feels off. If time, transportation or cost is ever an issue, DO NOT hesitate to call me for help and I will be there to go with you. Also, ALLOW ME TO SHOUT AGAIN. You all have the most wonderful gift of life and limitless potential to live and love fearlessly. All you want is within your reach; it just takes some action and hard work. In the meantime, love each day. Love each person. Make each day more magical for yourself and the people around you so you can go to sleep at the end of each day and think, ""DAMNIT; TODAY WAS AMAZING!

On this family holiday take a moment to cherish those you love. xo



It's Breast Cancer Awareness Month and sadly my daughter's have been suffering so much without their Mom from this awful disease. The picture is summer 2008 the year before she died with her cherished girls, Nicole was a very special Mom, wife, daughter and friend.



It's been a difficult time for all of us but especially for my girls. Megan has had a lot of emotional grief since she watched her Mom slowly die in our dining room - she was 7 and Mikayla 10.

But the last year and half has been brutal. Her Grandma (Nanny) was having chemo & mastectomy for breast cancer last winter then her gandfather, Jean-Guy (Pepe) and greatgrandmother (Mamere) died 2 weeks apart in April 2015 (she was living there at that time).  



Then she suffered severe concussion in boat accident last August on first day of holiday in Muskoka. Fortunately, she didn't die, as her Angel was looking over her - paramedics & ambulance were really great looking after her at hospital. Vacation over and beginning of long recovery. Megan has going anxiety/depression, she missed entire school year, not sleeping, sensitivity to light/sound with concussion and she still has symptoms. She's been under the care of awesome, Pediatric Concussion specialist Dr. Goulet, he's helped her with depression and her symptoms.

She developed severe anxiety & OCD triggered by her Nanny's stroke in August (thankfully Annette recovered quickly). Megan was hospitalized at CHEO psych ward overnight on labour day weekend, which was even more traumatizing for her and me. Psychiatrist prescribed a new drug that has helped her manage OCD. We have no health insurance nor money to pay for counselling and we're on months waiting list.


Then she started having ingrown toe nails this June that brought on 4 surgeries, many hospital visits and finally on morphine for pain. Then serious bacterial infection after last surgery ... been at hospitals, countless appointments/procedures for weeks ... she is so tired, sad and in pain it's hard to manage.  She has been on IV antibiotics for two weeks but struggling to get better with too many IV issues. She had 43 IV attempts over a week as her veins are tough - finally put in picc line (which had to be done twice). We have nursing visits daily to help with Megan's care which I need to be home for along with tissue damage from having two picc lines. 



I'm exhausted, stressed and hanging on for the girls. I tore my acl and rotator cuff  in February which has affected my ability to work. I was at hospital last night again - for me this time as not feeling well and thought I was having heart attack. Fortunately, I just have sinus infection that's been making me feel dizzy with vertigo, etc. I fight through depression as I have no choice, I'm alone most of the time and I my heart is empty, miss Nicole everyday. I love my work and helping people but sadly I've been unable to work consistently with all the girls needs. It has been very frustrating for me and my customers (some understanding, some not).

 Annette, girls' Nanny, has recovered enough from her stroke to stay with us this past week to help look after Megan. She had to leave today as needs to work for couple of days on her customers bookkeeping. We have no other family help or support, so not able to work. Unfortunately, death makes people uncomfortable and they disappear. 



Mikayla's also has struggled with bullying, depression, grief, anxiety and suicidal thoughts since grade 9, I wasn't able to work much during this time and that eroded all my savings. Mikayla's doing really well and don't want her to regress either after so many tough years. She's a very talented singer and writer and that's helped her get through many difficult days. Very proud of her strength. Mikayla's Music 



Unfortunately, with Megan's serious emotional, mental and health issues I have not been able to work consistently since last year to stay above water.  

 We lost our house last year and have been renting. I've had to declare bankruptcy with financial stress after years of looking after girls. I'm in arrears with Bell and scheduled to be cut off tomorrow, no money for groceries, clothes etc, owe couple staff pay, nothing left and no where to get any. I have two jobs to finish but that'll be it - as nothing lined up (they've been very patient customers) ... now applying for social assistance.

We have had to use Mikayla's money from her summer job that she was saving up for an apple laptop. We're going to be homeless soon and I don't have an answer and my girls are scared :(. I'm barely hanging on after 10 years of continuous crisis management. The last 5 years has been endless visits to CHEO, YSB, counsellor,   social workers, family doctor, psychiatrists,  psychologists, school principals, teachers, guidance, physio, concussion specialist. .. I've put my daughter's first and it's been an overwhelming challenge.

Last straw, I got in my truck this morning to try work .... no gas. Had to use change to get some gas to drive. We need some help to get through until I can get Megan well. 

 Anything would be deeply appreciated so I can support the girls through these continuing difficult time.  We need to pay medications, rent, expenses, food, gas etc.

 
Sincerely we thank you deeply, Stu

Because in its natural form it cannot be patented and therefore the profit for big pharma is not satisfactory; even if it saves lives.  They often bury the information.Gail found a natural health care provider that would work with her and guide her through the matrix of natural therapies and has been living a rewarding 2 ½ years with no discomfort.  One tumor has reduced in size by 50% and the other tumor is making slow progress.  This is why we need your help.   The problem is that none of these treatments are endorsed by the FDA or covered by any medical insurance and therefore not used by most cancer patients.  All of Gail’s care has come out of pocket.  1 in 3 women and 1 in 2 men will have Cancer in their lifetime!  Let's help Gail live so she can help others maybe even someone in your own family find a better way to heal!Thank you in advance for sharing this post  www.gofundme.com/GailEvelyn.  Any amount you give is greatly appreciated and counts!   With every donation we will send you updates on her condition and progress.

Cancer has been a frightening word that has become a reality for many, including her friends and family. But instead of others making the experience less scary for her, she is the one that inspires all of us to not be afraid and live life to the fullest. In a brief moment with Ashley, whether it be a stranger or those of us who already love her, you are in awe. Her beautiful spirit, fierce love for her daughter, positive attitude, fervent love of life, and her belief that kindness and compassion matter, make Ashley who she is.Ashley has always had a kind and giving heart. She has made an effort to pay-it-forward, whether it's helping friends or family, the homeless, volunteering at a women's shelter, or mentoring a child through the Big Brothers Big Sisters Program. Most recently, she has begun mentoring other cancer patients as they begin their own journey. It is also important to her to include her daughter, Avery, in these opportunities of kindness to instill these same qualities of giving in her daughter.So! Let's make a difference and donate to help Ashley just as she has done for so many others! Please contribute love, prayers, and donations to help with her medical bills and to give her the best possible chance of becoming our miracle and enjoying a long life with Avery.(See Ashley's full story below!)              Ashley's Story:Just months before receiving this devastating news of cancer, Ashley had already experienced a roller coaster of emotions. She had dealt with extreme lows such as, the separation and later, divorce from her husband, as well losing her dream job as an elementary school teacher due to budget cuts; but also experienced extraordinary highs when she gave birth to her beautiful daughter, Avery. To a normal person, that would be a lot to handle in the span of one year, but it wasn't for Ashley. She has always taken everything in stride and has dealt with the negatives with more bravery and strength than I can fathom. Although she is no longer teaching in a traditional classroom, she continues to impact the lives of many through the blog that she started shortly after her diagnosis,  www.cute4cancer.blogspot.com. It is a (mostly) light-hearted blog to keep her family and friends updated; but, also to keep us laughing through the tears. Many of her blog posts highlight the amazing relationship she has with  Avery. Spending quality time and making memories with her daughter has always been Ashley's main priority, while also giving her a normal toddler life, oblivious to her mom's illness. It is incredibly inspiring to see Ashley break past her illness every day and go above and beyond as a mother. Since this all began, Ashley has walked this journey with a positive outlook and a strong faith. Without hesitation, she intially underwent a double- mastectomy and oophorectomy (the removal of her ovaries) in 2013. Despite these surgeries leaving her without the ability to have any more children, she did what she had to do to ensure the longest life possible with her daughter. In June 2014, Ashley suffered a seizure-like episode and was rushed to the emergency room and forced to undergo brain surgery to remove a tumor on her Left Frontal Lobe. Following the brain surgery she completed grueling cycles of full brain and neck radiation, but she never lost her sparkle. In fact, she recovered like a champ only proving her strength to us all once again when the cancer in her brain went away!Ashley started chemotherapy in mid- 2015 to stave off the progression of the cancer that was already in her bones and spreading to her liver. In November, she found out that the cancer in her brain had returned. She went through a cycle of radiation and has since resumed the chemo treatments weekly. As hard as Ashley fights, the cancer persistently finds a way to keep up, requiring her to constantly switch treatment plans. She has begun exploring other options that may allow her to enter experimental trials. These trials are located in different states and would require Ashley to travel for treatment, which can be very costly, on top of her already mounting medical bills.Let's come together for Ashley! Any donation, big or small, will help  this single mom get the healthy life that she and her daughter both deserve.",674d77b4f1e8260d8828a94284572e12,32,0.8740571428571429,1050.0,1,1,breast cancer,0,1,2,1,1,0.0012953367875647669,0.0025906735751295338,0.22,3.3459329089233756,2.0,gofundme

I am battling breast cancer for the fifth time... I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma stage 4 breast cancer in 2013... I underwent a double mastectomy, aggressive chemotherapy and 5 1/2 weeks of daily radiation treatment! I went through another surgery to scrape my chest wall to remove any cancer cells that might have lingered... A few short weeks after finally having reconstructive surgery I found out that the cancer had returned... I was put on hormone blocking medication that seemed to do the trick for about a year... Then once again after a routine scan the cancer had come back, my doctors adjusted my hormone medication hoping to clear the cancer once again! It worked!!! But then only after about 9 months the cancer was back with 13 new tumors! My options were limited as no doctor will operate on the already dead skin from radiation... I am now on a chemo treatment that will continue until my doctor deems it unnecessary... I battle with pain on a daily basis that makes it hard for me to do everyday tasks. The nausea and pain is unbearable at times. In September I left my job due to all the pain and side effects of trestment. I have applied for disability, but who knows when that will become active. All extra money we had has been depleated due to me not working... Recently after finding a new lump I had another scan done. Results came back and the cancer has spread to right lymph node in my armpit and a spot on right side of my neck. I am back on an aggressive chemo and hormone blocked and still unable to work due to all the struggles my body goes through!

Anyone who knows Dawn also knows that this request for support was not her idea.  In fact it took a little convincing, patience, and gentle nudging before she agreed to this. It’s not easy to be in a position of vulnerability, but sometimes the path that is laid before us requires us to set aside our pride and accept help. I’ve known Dawn for over 15 years and have always known her to be a hard worker as well as a  loyal friend, daughter, and sister.  I light up a bit when I see her knowing that she always tells it like it is with a splash of her humor and wit. She is not one to beat around the bush and I think we all love her for that.  Admittedly, we have not been the closest of friends but we have walked similar paths and now we have one more thing in common. Alison and I ran into to Dawn a few months ago. We could see how upset she looked. With tears in her eyes  she said,  “I had no idea what you guys went through.”  How could she have known? If you haven’t been through it yourself then you wouldn’t know. The hope is that you never do. The endless barrage of tests, doctors, appointments, chemicals, results, and surgeries can be overwhelming to put it lightly.
Dawn has made a stellar attempt at balancing her work and family life. I am sure she could continue to do just this- fact is- she would. The concern is that it really detracts from keeping the stress low in an already highly stressful situation. I know at least some of what she is walking through and how very stressful and exhausting it can be. Anything that gives her the ability to focus more on her health and less on the stressors of life will help. It will increase her ability to continue her treatment and it will give her a better chance for the best possible outcome.   The last thing anyone wants to worry about is finances and in circumstances such as this. Our hope is to lessen the financial load so that she may focus on getting better.   We want her to not only get better to but to feel the support that a campaign such as this can bring. We love you Dawn!!!

She is currently undergoing radiation daily and chemotherapy every 3 weeks. She is the mother of a set of 12 yr. old fraternal twins. She has been on medical leave from work since her diagnosis. Unfortunately, stage 4 cancer is not something new to our family. Just 2 years ago we lost my father Manuel Munoz to his own battle of stage four cancer. In only 6 months after his diagnoses my mother, sister, his grandchildren and I lost who kept us together. Due to a late and misdiagnoses by her primary physician, the cancer has spread and consequently caused a neck fracture. Lesions on her neck and spine caused by this fracture have literally eaten through her bone. Her cancer could have been caught and treated at an early stage. Now, she is bed ridden. My family and I are hurting and suffering again; as we watch my sister Sylvia undergo what our father did. She is blessed to have the support of our family, friends and loved ones, however; as you can all imagine it is not stress-free to focus on fighting this horrific disease when in the back of her mind she is worried about her twins, mother and family. She is currently being treated in Los Angeles, and is consistently in and out of the hospital. As a single mother, her main priority is the well-being of her twins. I am reaching out for any help and support that would make this fight a little easier for my sister Sylvia. I have such an abundance of gratitude for all the love and support which has helped her in remaining focused, positive, and has given her the strength to continue to fight.Any help would be more than appreciated and all proceeds, regardless of whether goal is met or not, will go directly to my sister, Sylvia Munoz.

She is a woman who has not for a second stopped being an extremely inviting person to new and old people in her life.Last week, Sara flew to Florida for a visit with her family and scheduled an appointment for a lump in her breast she had recently noticed. After a series of biopsies, tests and scans, our worst nightmare became reality on Thursday, February 9th, when Sara was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer. She is among the youngest breast cancer patients her team of doctors have worked with to date.Needless to say, the journey ahead will be nothing short of a battle which we are CERTAIN Sara will overcome. After spending 7 years as a dedicated Neonatal Intensive Care Nurse, Sara knows how important it is to be surrounded by a strong support system of friends and loved ones. As is the nature of this diagnosis, Sara is needing to act rapidly, requiring countless doctor visits, procedures, and medications. These costs will add up quickly and we are trying to reduce the financial stress so Sara can focus on what is important- kicking cancer’s ass!This is where you come in.

Ana  is one of the kindest, most honest people I know, and has never backed down from a challenge. Her work ethic in the classroom, and on the basketball court was an inspiration to me and everyone around her. During our college years, I watched Ana overcome many challenges, and doing so with a smile on her face. Anyone who knows her can vouch for her extraordinary spirit of determination. Since graduating in 2013, Ana has been working hard gaining experience to apply to physicians assistant school.

Ana has recently been diagnosed with angiosarcoma involving breast paranchyma (cancer of the breast). This was a very rare diagnosis, especially for someone of Ana's age. When I first learned of the diagnosis, I was saddened, but instantly thought ""if anyone can get through this, it's Ana."" With this diagnosis comes a lot of financial burden for Ana and her family. It involves very expensive and extensive testing, surgery, and likelihood of mastectomy, not to mention the recovery afterwards. Ana is the last person to ask for anything from anyone else, but as a close friend who loves her dearly, I saw this as the best way to help.

You are supposed to get a letter in the mail...all is well, see you next year.  The phone call is that personalized step you do not want. It means something needs to be said. And in its truest form of doctor office protocol, it was not good news.  Jules has breast cancer. There are several tumors. Some have spread a bit. She needs a double mastectomy. The good news is they caught this early. Surgery and some other treatments should yield a strong prognosis.  Since this is Jules’ second brave bout with cancer, we are so grateful for that part of this heart wrenching picture. The bad news is Jules could be in surgery and recovery for at least 3 months. She is an hourly employee and all those wages will be lost during her healing time, as well as having additional, unanticipated out of pocket costs that go with such a major surgery.If you know Jules, you know her fierce determination to do anything she puts her mind to.  She is absolutely determined to beat this, and to do it with a strong sense of gratitude and optimism.  As a wife to Charlie and a mother to Brodie 12, and Lila 9, she is the unwavering pillar of strength and devotion to her family.  Her biggest worry, aside from beating cancer for the second time is how she will continue to support and care for her family. Jules is the mom whom others see pulling off any Pinterest recipe or handmade costume she desires.  Her sense of humor and enthusiasm for being at any event are apparent as soon as she arrives anywhere. She has an intellectual and spiritual vigor that anyone who knows her will attest to.

Her bubbly personality and smile are contagious. If you happened to meet her today, it would be no different, which is just short of incredible considering all that she and her family have been through in recent years.

Shortly after her mother passed away due to a recurrence of uterine cancer,  her husband was diagnosed with bladder cancer.  In the last 3 months, his condition changed to terminal despite aggressive chemo treatments. The medical bills have been mounting as the number of ER visits, hospital stays and treatments grow.

Danielle has been by his side at Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Newnan while juggling 2 full time jobs: xray tech and her most important title of all- mother. Through it all, she has managed to stay positive and prayerful.

In the midst of that turmoil, Danielle was diagnosed with Invasive Mammary Carcinoma ( breast cancer) just 1 month ago. While it is  unexpected for someone so young (only 4% of invasive breast cancers last year were in women under 40), her keen intuition and swift action allowed for early diagnosis.  With any type of cancer, prompt intervention is paramount.

She is scheduled for surgery October 23rd and will undergo a mastectomy with reconstruction , in the hopes of alleviating the need for additional surgeries, radiation or chemotherapy. Despite such difficult and shocking news, she has remained a pillar of strength for those around her, namely her children.

We know of her amazing determination and strong will, and she only sees solutions, not problems! She has already begun forging a plan for her family while she will be out of work and starting the long road to recovery.

However, dealing with unpredictable absences to care for a spouse, along with a 2-3 month recovery means she does not have sufficient vacation time to cover her post procedure period. This is not something any 34 year old woman should have to think about but it has become her reality.

Her friends and family will be there for her during this time in any way possible, whether its preparing a meal, folding laundry, keeping her company, or getting the kids to after school activities or church.  The truth is, she could use a little more help! 

Any donations provided will be used to cover basic necessities and expenses related to running a household and caring for her kids. It will also take care of non covered medical costs and follow up care. The last thing she needs to do is stress about financial responsibilities as she recuperates. We need as much support as we can to allow Danielle to focus on her health and beating this horrible diagnosis. She is a warrior in every sense of the word!

All those who love her thank you in advance for whatever you may contribute, no amount is too small!

Since i have known her she ‘s been a fighter, a wonderful mom and dad taking care of her beautiful daughter Arianna. But as some of you may know she has been struggling with breast cancer for 5 years. Although it seemed that she would be able to get passed it, even after having major surgeries to remove this cancer, she is facing yet another battle. This upcoming treatment  seems like its going to be a long road to win and overcome.  If you all know Ally, you know she is an out of the box thinker. Before she has the surgery that her oncologist recommends- of removing all her lymph nodes, she will be getting treatment in California at a cancer clinic. Removing the lymph nodes has life-long, permanent effects. Most of the treatment in California is unfortunately not covered by her insurance. Also, all of the bills for her scans, labs and procedures even to find out that this is really cancer, again, are starting to come in. Not only does she have to pay for her treatments basically out of pocket, she also has to buy flight plus accommodations. Finding out you have cancer literally stops your life. It changes everything until it is resolved. I have seen Ally go through so much in all of our 8 years of friendship. I just want to help her. We all know how positive she is, how mindful of her healthy she is, how much she loves her daughter, family and friends. Ally is finding a way to fight this and kill this once and for all.

She is 22 years old and a full time nursing student at the University of Texas at El Paso. This summer she, as most college students do, came back home to Dallas, TX to be with her family. However, on July 1st, 2015 she and close loved ones around her were left in complete shock and disbelief when she was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer.We couldn't seem to understand why this was happening but knew we had to come together and help April. The oncologist told us April’s cancer is very aggressive and will require a 12 week full course of chemotherapy, a full double mastectomy, radiotherapy, and eventually breast reconstruction.  The oncologist's staff first informed us April's insurance would be covering most of April's medical costs and chemo was scheduled to start on July 9th, 2015. Unfortunately April received a call from her doctor two days before her scheduled chemotherapy informing her that her insurance would not be covering her chemo, and that she must look for another oncologist. With so much devastation going on we had to accept what was happening and keep searching for answers, making calls to every oncologist in Dallas looking for anyone who would be willing to see her and take her insurance. Feeling as if we we're just receiving bad news after bad news, we still had faith and hope that something positive would come out of this, because of that we were able to finally find someone who would see her and take her insurance the next day, but the medical bills are quickly piling up for April. We are desperately reaching out to family and friends, or anyone at that matter, her tumors just seem to keep growing rapidly, so please help us with her recovery. Any little counts and it will all be greatly appreciated! April stays strong every day and has dreams ahead of her to one day become a nurse and help patients like her overcome these tragedies of fallen times.

Still a newlywed with my wife, we decided it was time for us to start our lives together. We traveled for a month and arrived in Springfield, MO in March 2015. Later that month, Joy began to complain of lower back pain. Since she was only 29 years old and an active gym goer, we assumed it was from a strained back muscle. The pain did not go away on its own and only became worse. We wasted three months on the idea her back pain was from the gym. We visited a chiropractor about ten times and saw a doctor (who agreed with us and prescribed anti-inflammatory steroids and muscle relaxers). The medicine helped, but the pain returned when we ran out of meds. After visiting a clinic to get a refill, a very smart nurse noticed the symptoms were not from a typical pulled back muscle. An MRI later, there was a large mass spotted at the base of Joy's spine that was pushing on the nerves. Joy had a biopsy and confirmed it was cancer. At this point, the doctor ordered a CT Scan. That's when we discovered Joy had stage IV lung cancer. It already spread to her bones. Joy reported some head pain and another CT scan later confirmed a tumor on her brain as well. A month later, Joy started to lose vision in her left eye. We saw an eye specialist that confirmed the cancer was there as well. Lung, bones, brain, and eye. We've had to juggle two different hospitals because Springfield does not have all the technology to treat all of Joy's cancer. We have to travel to St. Louis, Missouri which is about 4 hours away. Joy had a cyber knife radiosurgery done in August for the brain tumor. We hope it was a success but won't know until months later because of the length of time it takes radiation to work. The doctors define success as the tumor not growing any more than it has and not necessarily elimination of the growth. In September 2015, we were told the first line of chemo was not a success. There was additional growth to her lungs and bones. We obtained a second medical opinion and he advised a different chemo treatment. Meanwhile, Joy had another biopsy to take samples of the tumor for genetic testing. In October 2015, Joy began to be in so much pain that she was unable to walk. Joy had immediate surgery on her spine to remove as much of the tumor as possible and to have screws inserted into her spine for support. She has been fighting this cancer with all of her strength. She walks a half mile each day no matter how she feels only because the doctor told her that's the best way to regain strength in her legs. Joy has shown cancer the middle finger as she has defied its advances with all of her strength.  Healthcare in the United States is very expensive. We are currently living off our savings and are lucky to have insurance through the Marketplace Exchange (Obamacare). Next year, we are not eligible for subsidies since I am not working, and Joy being an immigrant to the United States is ineligible for Medicaid. It's going to cost a lot to maintain our health insurance but it's better than being uninsured and ruining our financial lives. Joy requires full time care. I do what I can for her, even if it means bathing, cooking, dressing, and helping her use the bathroom.A year ago, we were looking forward to our life together and couldn't wait to be next to each other. Today we hold each day as sacred and spend as much time together as we can. Joy was given a less than a year prognosis for life in July. Statistics aren't on our side. But it doesn't mean either one of us will give up this fight. There are stage IV lung cancer survivors out there and Joy is extremely tough. Life doesn't always go to your plan and you have to adapt. We have difficulty asking people for help, even though we sorely need it. I don't expect anything from anyone. I'm only doing this because I've had several people ask about it. So here it is. Joy is thousands of miles away from her family and friends in Thailand, but  receives encouragement from her friends all around the globe including Canada, Norway, Germany, and of course from her home country. Thank you for reading and your support.-------------------------------------------------ผมชื่อ Joe Hyden (โจ ไฮเดน) และนี่เป็นเรื่องเกี่ยวกับภรรยาของผม Joy Hyden (จอย ไฮเดน) เธอมีอายุ 30 ปีและกำลังต่อสู้กับมะเร็งระยะสุดท้าย เมึ่อเดือนมกราคมปีนี้ผมถูกปลดออกจากงาน เราสองคนพึ่งแต่งงานและผมตัดสินใจว่านี่คือเวลาที่ผมต้องเริ่มต้นชีวิตใหม่กับเธอ พวกเราท่องเที่ยวเป็นเวลาหนึ่งเดือนและมาถึง Springfield, Missouri (สปริงฟิลด์, มิสซูรี่) เมื่อเดือนมีนาคมที่ผ่านมา ในช่วงปลายเดือนมีนาคมภรรยาของผมมีกาลปวดหลังส่วนล่าง เธออายุเพียง 29 ปีและเธอชอบออกกำลังกาย พวกเราคิดว่ามันเป็นแค่กล้ามเนื้อตึง ความปวดหลังไม่ได้หายไปแต่จะแย่ลง พวกเราเสียเวลาไปสามเดือนคิดที่ว่าอาการปวดหลังของเธอมาจากการออกกำลังกาย พวกเราไปหาหมอกล้ามเนื้อประมาณ 10 ครั้ง และไปพบแพทย์จนได้สเตียรอยด์ต้านการอักเสบและยาผ่อนคลายกล้ามเนื้อ ยาเหล่านั้นช่วยแต่อาการปวดหลังกลับมาเมื่อยาหมด หลังไปรับยามาเพิ่มที่คลินิกมีพยาบาลที่ฉลาดมากคนหนึ่งสังเกตเห็นอาการไม่ได้มาจากกล้ามเนื้อตึงทั่วไป ผลตรวจของ MRI ออกมาว่า มีก้อนเนื้อที่ด้านล่างของกระดูกสันหลังของจอย มันผลักดันเส้นประสาท เธอได้มีการตรวจชิ้นเนื้อและพบว่ามันเป็นมะเร็ง ณ จุดนี้คุณหมอสั่ง CT สแกน พบว่าจอยเป็นโรคมะเร็งปอดระยะสุดท้าย และแพร่กระจายไปถึงกระดูกของเธอ จอยมีอาการปวดหัวและ CT สแกน อีกอันหนึ่งพบว่ามีเนื้องอกในสมองของเธอ หนึ่งเดือนต่อมาเธอเสียการมองเห็นในตาซ้าย หมออีกท่านหนึ่งยืนยันว่ามีโรคมะเร็งในลูกตา เธอต้องไปรักษาสองโรงพยาบาลเพราะว่า Springfield ไม่มีเทคโนโลยีในการรักษามะเร็งของเธอทั้งหมด เราต้องเดินทางไปรักษาที่ St. Louis, Missouri (เซนต์หลุยส์ รัฐมิสซูรี่) ซึ่งเป็นประมาณ 4 ชั่วโมง จอยได้รับการผ่าตัดโดยวิธีการของ Cyberknife Radiosurgery สำหรับเนื้องอกในสมอง เราหวังว่ามันจะประสบความสำเร็จแต่เราจะไม่ทราบจนกว่าหลายเดือนต่อมาเพราะมันใช้เวลานานสำหรับวิธีการนี้ถึงจะรู้คำตอบ คุณหมอบอกว่าความสำเร็จ ของการผ่าตัดวิธีนี้คือการหยุดความโตของเนื้องอก เมี่อกันยายนที่ผ่านมาเราได้รับแจ้งว่าคีโมครั้งแรกไม่ประสบความสำเร็จ มีการเติบโตเพิ่มขึ้นของเนื้องอกที่ปอดและกระดูกของเธอ เราได้รับความเห็นทางการแพทย์ที่สองและเขาแนะนำคีโมอีกวิธีหนึ่ง ในขณะเดียวกันเนื้องอกของจอยนำมาตรวจสอบอีกครั้งหนึ่งสำหรับการทดสอบดีเอ็นเอ ในช่วงเดือนตุลาคมจอยเริ่มที่มีความเจ็บปวดมากจนเธอไม่สามารถที่จะเดินได้ จอยได้รับการผ่าตัดทันทีในกระดูกสันหลังของเธอสำหรับที่จะ เอาเนื้องอกออกเป็นไปได้มากที่สุดเท่าที่เป็นไปได้และใส่สกรูเข้าไปในกระดูกสันหลัง เธอต่อสู้กับโรคมะเร็งนี้ด้วยความเข้มแข็งของเธอ เธอเดินครึ่งไมล์ในแต่ละวันแม้ว่าเธออยู่ในความเจ็บปวดเพราะหมอบอกเธอว่าเป็นวิธีที่ดีที่สุดที่จะฟื้นความแข็งแรงในขาของเธอ การรักษาในโรงพยาบาลในสหรัฐอเมริกามีราคาแพงมาก ขณะนี้เรามีเงินเก็บที่นำมาเป็นค่าใช้จ่ายและเรามีความโชคดีที่ได้รับประกัน Marketplace Exchange (Obamacare) ปีหน้าเราไม่ได้มีสิทธิ์ได้รับเงินสมทบเพราะว่าผมไม่ได้ทำงานและจอยเป็นผู้อพยพของประเทศสหรัฐอเมริกาเลยไม่ได้ประกันของรัฐบาล ประกันจะมีราคาแพงมากแต่จะดีกว่าไม่ได้มีการประกัน จอยต้องมีการดูแลแบบเต็มเวลา ผมทำสิ่งที่ผมสามารถทำได้สำหรับเธอรวมถึงการอาบน้ำ, การทำอาหาร, การแต่งกายและช่วยให้เธอใช้ห้องน้ำ ปีที่ผ่านมาเรากำลังมองไปข้างหน้าเพื่อชีวิตของเราและไม่สามารถรอเพื่อที่จะได้อยู่ด้วยกัน วันนี้เราเก็บไว้ในแต่ละวันเป็นสิ่งศักดิ์สิทธิ์และใช้เวลาร่วมกันมากที่สุดเท่าที่เราสามารถ ในเดือนกรกฎาคมจอยได้รับแจ้งว่าเธอมีหนึ่งปีที่จะมีชีวิตอยู่ สถิติไม่ได้อยู่บนด้านข้างของเราแต่มันไม่ได้หมายความว่าคนใดคนหนึ่งของเราจะยอมแพ้การต่อสู้ครั้งนี้ มีคนที่รอดชีวิตจากโรคมะเร็งระยะสุดท้ายอย่และจอยเป็นคนที่มีความอดทนอย่างมาก ชีวิตไม่เคยปฏิบัติตามแผนของเราและเราจะต้องปรับตัว เรามีปัญหาในการขอความช่วยเหลือถึงแม้เราจำเป็นต้องใช้มันอย่างมาก ผมไม่ได้คาดหวังอะไรจากใคร ผมก็แค่ทำสิ่งที่เพราะเคยมีหลายคนถามเกี่ยวกับเรื่องนี้ ขอบคุณสำหรับการอ่านและการสนับสนุนของ",911426a8b95a3717670f2e203457943e,52,0.13484,1200.0,6,1,lung cancer,0,3,0,2,0,0.002105263157894737,0.0,0.010353306587291316,3.8229106224270395,0.0,gofundme

All contributions, will be used for my medical expenses associated with this type of treatment.      My name is Thomas Faison, I am a 36 years old father of four. I have three boys and a baby girl. In November 2017, I was diagnosed with Lung Cancer. This type of Lung Cancer does not come from smoking. In fact, large numbers of non-smokers are diagnosed with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer every day. Currently, I am on the targeted therapy drug Tagrisso. Until recently, the Tagrisso was successfully clearing up my lung cancer. Even though my Oncologist assured me that the drug Tagrisso would clear up my cancer, my last CT scan revealed otherwise. There were multiple growths in the tumors in my lungs.  My only other options for cancer treatments are clinical trials, which are not currently available, and/or chemotherapy. Rather than poisoning my body with chemotherapy, my hope is to go the natural route in treating my cancer.      Despite the fact that I have medical insurance, natural medicine is not covered by insurance companies. However, there are several natural treatments. Naturopathic clinics and Hospitals all over the world have successfully cleared up cancer. While mainstream pharmaceutical drugs have become the norm to many, natural and holistic treatment has proven to be most effective through out history.         I am raising for naturopathic medical treatment for my lung cancer. This treatment will include Organic Germanium, Mo Zyme Forte (Organic minerals), Pan Immune- (extremely high dose pancreatic enzymes), sodium bicarbonate, iv medications (vitamin C), BioResonance Device (BRD) (generates electromagnetic frequencies), pulse electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF), Asyra and Bio-well,  How the money raised will be spent, be specific as possible·         12 IVs cost $2400 ·         BRD is $720·         PEMF $450·         Asyra assessments totals to $1200·         Bio-Well sessions $300·         Nutritional consultation $72·         Acupuncture $1140·         Supplements $3600Totals $9882 ( this is the pricing for 6 weeks of treatment.

She is a beautiful 26 year old, single mother to a gorgeous 3 year old baby girl named Aviiannah. She has always worked a minimum of 2 jobs in order to give her daughter the life she needs. About 3 months ago, she had a persistent cough after having a cold and could not understand why her skin was so itchy. She began having difficulty breathing and the itchiness had not improved. When she went to get checked, they told her she had Asthma and Eczema. She was prescribed an inhaler and thought that was that. About a month ago she injured her arm on a machine at work and the pain of the injury kept persisting. She got checked place after place and no one could tell her what was wrong with her arm. She didn't hit a nerve and there was no logical explanation as to why her pain was not better. She finally went to one place and they did an x-ray and thought that they saw something near her heart and said that her aortic arch was prominent and that it was usually due to an aneurysm. They sent her to the ER to get a chest x-ray. When they got the chest x-ray back they found something none of us were ready for, a tumor in her lung. They estimated the tumor to be 9cmX7cm after getting a CatScan. The next day my dad and Amanda went to see an oncologist but ended up at the ER due to her having severe chest pains all night and day and from having difficulty breathing. After being admitted and having another x-ray, the doctor informed us that her tumor was in between both lungs and that due to her symptoms of itchy skin, chest pain, coughing, weight loss and the tumor and its location, they were leaning towards some form of Lymphoma. They performed several biopsies non-invasive and invasive in order to get enough sufficient samples for testing. Finally after a successful biopsy of tissues we received her results and she was officially diagnosed with B-Cell Lymphoma. None of us were ready to hear this but we are ready for a fight. Amanda has already lost so much work from this and due to it being so sudden there was no time to prepare. Please, help us raise money for my sister so she can afford these medical bills that she is about to receive. She deserves everything in the world and the one thing she needs right now is support and security for her and her daughter.  Amanda has always put herself second and taken care of everything and everyone and for the first time, she needs to focus on her and take a helping hand. Please, anything helps.I love you, Mel.

His name is Daniel, and on his 18th birthday he was diagnosed with advanced Hodgkin Lymphoma. He has been fighting this disease very bravely for over a year now, with optimism and good humor.After the biopsy confirmed Daniel's diagnosis, he started the ABVD chemotherapy protocol at the University of Campinas hospital, in Brazil. That initial treatment made the tumor cells shrink, but unfortunately it didn’t fully heal him. Daniel then started the ICE protocol, a heavier chemotherapy technique made in preparation for an autologous stem cells transplantation. However, after finishing the ICE chemotherapy sessions, the results weren’t satisfactory enough, and his chances of healing with the bone marrow transplant became slim. Around 15% of the patients don’t respond well to the treatment, and sadly he happened to be part of that group. We decided not to submit him to the transplant since it’s a very harsh and delicate procedure. After taking him to different specialists, we were advised to treat him with immunotherapy, using a drug called brentuximab vedotin. This drug acts directly on the lymphoma cells, identifying a membrane protein named CD30 present on these ill cells. If this works well it will reduce the size of the tumors and he'll be able to proceed with the bone marrow transplant. The issue with this treatment is that the cost of the medicine is very expensive and not covered by our health care plan. Each vial costs around $4,000. This is why I’m creating this campaign. We want to give him the best possible treatment. 100% of the money raised will be used towards healing him, paying for all the medicine and treatments he needs. Any donation will be greatly appreciated and we will be forever thankful. We will donate any surplus after Daniel is healed. Please share this campaign among your friends and spread the word. With a little bit of everyone’s help we will cure this amazing boy I'm proud to call my brother. There’s still so much he wants to achieve, we can’t wait to get him fully recovered! UPDATEDaniel's currently in a clinical research group sponsored by Merck pharmaceutical company, held at Santa Marcelina Hospital in São Paulo. With your help, he's now being provided with Brentuximab (medication) every three weeks. However, we continue with this campaign to help pay for support treatments and medication, as well as the bone marrow transplant (which is NOT included in this treatment) he'll need to do after finishing immunotherapy.PORTUGUÊS2 - Meu nome é Rodrigo, e estou criando esta campanha para arrecadar fundos para o tratamento do meu irmão caçula, Daniel. Quando tinha acabado de completar 18 anos, ele foi diagnosticado com linfoma de Hodgkin no mediastino em estado avançado. Ele está lutando contra esta doença faz mais de um ano, com muita valentia, bom humor e otimismo, como sempre teve.Primeiramente, ele foi submetido ao protocolo ABVD de quimioterapia, no hospital da Unicamp. Isto fez o tamanho do tumor diminuir, mas infelizmente não o eliminou. Então, Daniel passou pelo protocolo ICE de quimioterapia, em preparação a um transplante autólogo de medula óssea. Entretanto, os resultados não foram satisfatórios, a doença não regrediu o tanto esperado para fazer um transplante de medula com boas chances de sucesso. Os pacientes que não respondem bem são chamados de refratários, e acontece em aproximadamente 15% dos casos; desafortunadamente é o caso dele.  Após levá-lo a diferentes especialistas, fomos aconselhados a seguir o tratamento com imunoterapia, utilizando a droga Brentuximabe vedotina, que age diretamente nas células do linfoma, reconhecendo uma proteína da membrana denominada CD30. O problema é que este medicamento é muito caro e não é coberto pelo SUS. Cada dose do medicamento custa em torno de 4 mil dólares. Por isso estamos criando esta campanha, para que Daniel possa receber o único tratamento indicado no momento e que antecede o transplante de medula. Todo o dinheiro arrecadado será destinado aos tratamentos que possam curar-lhe. Este garoto alegre e cheio de ideias só deseja ter de volta seu maior tesouro, que é a sua saúde. Voltar a estudar e realizar os sonhos de quem ainda tem toda a vida pela frente. Quem já acompanhou alguém com esta enfermidade sabe como é difícil o tratamento.Agradecemos muito por qualquer quantia doada. Qualquer excedente será doado a uma causa similar uma vez que o Daniel estiver curado.Por favor divulguem esta campanha entre seus amigos. Com um pouquinho da ajuda de todos poderemos curar este garoto incrível que é o meu irmão.ATUALIZAÇÃODaniel agora conseguiu ser incluído em um grupo de pesquisa clínica da farmacêutica Merck, realizado no hospital Santa Marcelina, para receber a cada três semana a medicação Brentuximabe.

I decided to put a GoFundMe together as he wasn’t too keen on the idea, but eventually I convinced him this is a time of real need.  I haven't finished my story but find the need to put the GoFundMe up due to the nature of the illness. We had a small transit business; majority of the work was with the crews that built Wheatstone in the Pilbara. We enjoyed looking after them and they looked after us.  Unfortunately, they did such a good job and built it too quickly and due to the downturn in mining, business slowed. Ric decided to go back working as a diesel mechanic. He had commenced working in the rail workshop. He found it great to be back in a workshop environment, within a great working culture and good leadership. It was all looking good, but he was finding it hard to stand up from a crouched down position. He would have a feeling of nearly passing out, so had to hang onto something on the way up. He put it down as maybe “I’m not a young fella anymore,”  and the Pilbara heat with some humidity, and a flu he couldn’t shake from Boxing Day. He also said he had a feeling that someone was trying to strangle him. Little at this stage did he know the Lymphoma was tight around his trachea.  Every cough and sneeze would cause a severe headache, and this too was the Lymphoma squeezed tight around the cerebral vein to the brain, and a blood clot to go with that. On the night of 14th of February about midnight , I convinced him to go to the Nickol Bay hospital, as this lump was trying to push out of the right side of his chest. That night a fine doctor was on duty. He mentioned his father was a diesel mechanic too and the things they got up to. He was thorough and told him, “This isn't going to be good news,” admitted him to the ward, and organised a CT scan for the next day. After the doctor got the report of the CT scan and a physical examination, the facts are there. The mass in the lungs is huge, the lymph nodes have lumps on both sides of the body, in the groin and shoulders, the biggest lump being in the left shoulder where he had the shoulder arthroscopy some three years ago.  Looks as though we are looking at stage 4. What does ‘stage’ mean? The stage of your Hodgkin lymphoma means how far it has grown and spread. Staging is important because it helps your doctor to plan your treatment. Stage 4 means there is lymphoma in body organs outside of lymph nodes or spleen, such as in your liver, lungs or bones. The survival rate  to 5 years is 65%. 19th February ,the doctor organised with Fiona Stanley hospital that he see a thoracic surgeon on Wednesday 21st at 9am. It was suggested he would fly down, but we made the decision that the whole family go down. So a planning of the drive was made for the 1536km distance, to get down in one day, with all seven kids in daylight. We left Tuesday morning 2am,so the kids would be sleeping some of the distance. Wednesday 21st February, the cardiothoracic surgeon gave us a run-down of what it might be and pointed out that it was attached to the trachea and cerebral brain vein, and the large mass in the chest was hard up against the heart and pushing at Ric’s right chest. A heart test was carried out and it came out that it had excessive fluid around it. Sometimes when the heart is under stress this happens. A biopsy was needed, so that was organised that afternoon . He let us take a photo with our mobile of his computer screen of the CT scan. It’s the photo above. They made the decision that the swollen and biggest lymph node in the left shoulder would be the target, rather than go into the chest. 4 attempts with fine needle aspiration and two core needles and they settled on that. We waited 10 days for a result, but they still didn’t know what it was. Another attempt would be made; this time they would remove the lymph node completely. This would give them more tissue to play with and find out how to treat this . This happenedon Friday 2nd March. The next appointment was with the haematologist-doctor on March the 8th. He told us the result, Hodgkin’s Lymphoma Classic. He gave two options for chemotherapy, hard intensity or mild. He explained that the hard intensity can kill it quicker, but there is the risk a second cancer can develop from this treatment down the road. The option of mild was taken, but it is still hard on the body, so it is now booked in for Tuesday 13th march, and to expect a good six months of treatments. That afternoon he had a PET scan (positron emission tomography). This helps with the locating of the cancers in the body. They inject a mixture of liquid radioactive material and sugar,  which find their way to the cancers. They know by physical examination that there are nodes swollen in both shoulders, under the arms and both sides of the groin, but where else and how big they are, the PET scan will show. Ric has always been happy with his insurance cover for loss of income and life, having payed top level premiums for so many years and would always say that it was more important than insurance for assets, but timing wasn’t great, as business was slowing down, and unfortunately, we missed some repayments on the policy we had held for some 16 years. This was enough to cancel the policy out and same happened with our private health policy. I told Ric not to bash himself over it, just to get better We do have faith in the public hospital system, starting with the Nickol Bay Hospital, the fantastic doctor that did the original diagnosis, and the nurses that helped me along the way to get an appointment to Fiona Stanley The experience of the Fiona Stanley Hospital was wonderful; the building is a show piece, the organisation and  culture of its people are great and the food of the cafes is healthy. I think Ric is so lucky to be treated at such a hospital. It sure makes us more comfortable about being a public patient. Decisions will have to be made now, as living in the Pilbara without an income doesn’t look possible, with the cost of living so much more and a long haul of treatments in Perth required.  Also with a swag of kids (seven)  to look after, it will be another challenge, but they are good  kids and I’m sure they are ready for some changes.",9967376030ab86b5773f172b71b11bce,59,0.9773,330.0,4,1,lymphoma,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

Her pediatrician called my sister concerned and confident that something was not right and immediately scheduled a biopsy for the following morning.The biopsy was postponed due to testing for the following day and she had a PET Scan to trace the location of cancer if present. The doctors then performed the biopsy and later that evening, our worst nightmare was confirmed-unsure of what form, she inevitably has some form of Lymphoma... January 4, 2019 marked day one of chemotherapy, something that a 15 year old girl shouldn't have to experience following Christmas break entering a new year...     Although being caught off guard with everything that's happening, she is in amazingly good spirits and taking chemotherapy very well with no negative reactions. The tumor has reduced in size, but we're not in the clear yet. On January 8th, 2019 she was officially diagnosed with Stage 3b Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma/Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. It's treatable with a high rate of survival and one of the most common forms of cancer especially in adolescents.    My sister and brother-in-law are being faced with financial discord and are stressing on what to do... Being hit with such devastating news and the stress of the situation-I would like to alleviate their worry and stress any way possible. This is why I am creating this fund, money should be the last thing keeping my niece from having the chance at living and receiving to the fullest the best treatment she can possibly receive. Due to her health insurances network means that she will have to do her treatment in Dallas, which is approximately 65 miles/1hr 20 minutes away from home.   Kahlan will be done with chemo for the week on Thursday [Jan. 10] but has a follow up on Saturday, her health insurance will not cover the days she is not receiving treatment leaving my sister and brother-in-law with hotel costs. Being that my sister and Sean are overwhelmed financially I am asking for any donations* to go toward the $1000 deductible that must be paid EACH TREATMENT; COMMUTE EXPENSES such as gas to get back and forth on a 150 mile round trip, HOTEL EXPENSES as well as ANY other expenses that come from my niece getting treatment so she can be well again.    With all that Sean and Sofia are being faced with at such short notice and the circumstances alone*; MONEY should be the LAST thing on their minds. No parent wants to see their child sick and suffering, that's alone is a whole lot to handle!  I will post updates as information comes in, please keep my family in your prayers and feel free to share this. Our family appreciates all of you for taking a moment to read this and for all the compassion and love that have been sent our way for Kahlan!

If you do not already know my sister, Katie, I would like to introduce you.Katie is mother to my two nieces, Ursa and Eevie. They are probably the cutest nieces in this part of the world, as you can probably tell from the picture, despite Eevie's grumpy goblin-face. She is also married to my brother-in-law, Nick, possibly the most loyal husband one can hope to find. This was obvious, even before the last few months, but his ever-persistent hard work has become even more apparent since. She is my loving parents' baby girl, and sister to my brother and I. Not to mention, foster mom to a whole pack of pets.This past Christmas was our worst Christmas to date. In the midst of preparing for the holiday, we received the gut-wrenching call. The lump on her neck wasn't nothing. It was cancer.Although it seemed the world had stopped spinning for all of us, her fantastic new team of doctors and medical personnel wanted to get the ball rolling immediately, and they did. In the course of less than a week, she had completed a battery of diagnostic tests, biopsies, and a port implantation to receive chemotherapy. She was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma on the Tuesday before Christmas, and that Friday she started an aggressive regimen of chemotherapy, with all that entails. Fortunately, as some of you may know, while very rare, Hodgkin's Lymphoma is a very treatable, and even curable cancer. With a team of wonderful doctors and nurses, a nasty concoction of chemicals, and her tireless effort, Katie has completed eight rounds of chemotherapy, and the cancer has been found to be no longer active with her last round of scans. While we all celebrate in light of this outcome, the medical bills do continue to pile up. This is why I am sharing this with all of you.Throughout this process of constant oncology appointments, chemo infusions, and testing, Katie and Nick's family has been blessed with an excellent support system - our parents have provided incredible support through constant childcare during the days, and everyone has pitched in to help with transportation to every medical appointment,with housekeeping needs, and cooking. Family and friends have been such great sources of help in so many ways, but a big financial burden remains, as Nick has been the sole breadwinner for the household, on top of evening and weekend caregiver for both Katie, and their two children, who are a serious handful at almost four and one and a half years old. Despite the fact that Katie's prognosis is very good, the first year is especially critical in terms of worrying about recurrence, and she will have to keep her port for now and receive repeated scans to look for any more Hodgkin's activity. Though the most difficult part of her treatment is over for her physically, her family is now left figure out how to try to get back to normal, while the medical bills continue to stack up. They have been forced to make major lifestyle changes in order to put their children first, but they have been stretched to their limits. This is why I am urging people to give what they can, no matter how little. If we can raise $7,000, it will let Katie's family to put much of the stress of the last few months behind them, and to move forward concentrating on being healthy together. I want to thank you all, again, for reading my story.",ea0efdee75699f51c703efabd99cbf9d,23,0.5871428571428572,660.0,6,1,lymphoma,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

His doctor quickly ordered a slew of tests, and about a month later,  Erik was diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Prior to his diagnosis, Erik was a healthy 27 year-old dude. His diagnosis completely blindsided us.  Since December 7, 2017, Erik has undergone two immunotherapy treatments as a part of a clinical trial. He will undergo one more treatment in January. Luckily, the side effects of immunotherapy have been manageable for Erik. Other than fatigue and some soreness, he is feeling great. Since his first treatment, his original tumor on his lymph node has significantly shrunk and his back pain completely went away.  Despite the progress and the effectiveness of immunotherapy, Erik will still need to go through 6 months of chemotherapy - administered every two weeks. This regimen of chemo will drastically suppress Erik's immune system to the point that Erik's doctors have recommended that he not work during this time. Erik's doctors feel confident that with this treatment plan, he is going to beat this. We have the utmost faith in our team of doctors at Northwestern. Now this is the hard part. The part that I never imagined writing. The part that I have re-written about 10 times already. We need help. Cancer is expensive.

His smile is contagious and he absolutely loves life.  His goal right now is to fight for his life and do so with a positive attitude. Timmy’s ultimate career goal is to join the Marines and serve his country. He also would like to work towards becoming a OCSD Deputy Sheriff...just like his dad! Back in December 2017,  Timmy discovered a lump on his neck and was taken to his pediatrician to have it looked at.  After many tests, he was rushed to the hospital and admitted for many more tests and a biopsy of the tumor in question.  The waiting was excruciating, as the seven long days seemed like months. Timmy was diagnosed with the rare cancer, Hodgkin’s Lymphoma Stage IV. While this was a scary time for our family, Timmy was brave and ready to begin chemo. He was ready to do whatever else was needed to be cured. Timmy finished chemo and radiation June 2018. He was so excited to have his PICC Line removed and feel “normal” again. Sadly, the day of his line removal, we were advised that he had developed a blood clot. So the idea of being in remission and free of all reminders of cancer came to a stop. His doctor advised him...The blood thinner, Lovenox (shots) would need to be taken twice a day for 3-6 months. August 15, 2018, Timmy found a new lump in his neck and the Oncologist requested to have a rush on getting it biopsied. The find was absolutely unbelievable and devastating. Fast forward to August 27... Our family was given the shattering news that Timmy’s Hodgkin’s Lymphoma has in fact returned. A relapse?! To be diagnosed a second time within a few months of a relapse is extremely rare! However, Timmy explained that he was ready to fight his second battle with this horrible disease. We’re so proud of our strong and brave son. We will begin treatment in September 17, and will be praying that this rare cancer will be killed once and for all! Treatment will include...4 rounds of chemo, radiation and a Autologous Stem Cell Transplant. We know that this fight will be extremely difficult, but we will give it all we have! The Schwitters do not give up! We will win this fight. With this new diagnosis, treatment will be conducted in Los Angeles, CA. The many months of commuting, overnight stays and medical bills will be a bit difficult this go around.

In December, it was discovered that the lymphoma was back in a few new spots. More invasive biopsies were done and confirmed what we had hoped NOT to be true. Bryce started chemo again in January 2019. So far he is tolerating treatment well. Soon, the doctors will be extracting stem cells from Bryce in order to do a stem cell transplant in April. During that time, Bryce will be admitted at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh the entire 4-6 week process. Please continue to pray for Bryce and his family.March 27th, 2018 Bryce was taken to his doctor to investigate a strange lump that had formed on his neck. A few weeks earlier, he had an unexplained rash on his chest and back that didn't seem to respond well to treatment. Both of these instances were somewhat alarming and Bryce was then sent to Brookville Hospital for X-rays and a CT scan. Within the hour, the doctor's office was calling and said they needed to head to Pittsburgh to Children's Hospital right away. At that point, Bryce was admitted and taken for more testing. A biopsy was performed on the lump in his neck and another CT scan done. The morning after he was admitted, the oncology team did confirm that he did have a form of lymphoma, they just weren't sure of the type at that point, and needed to wait for the biopsy results.  In the meantime, more tests followed. They took bone marrow samples from his pelvis, PET scan, EKG, echocardiogram, drained fluid from his lung and inserted a PICC line. The PET scan showed spots on both sides of his neck, a large area in his chest cavity (that was ultimately putting pressure on his lungs), and also the splene. The days that followed were emotionally exhausting, not knowing the extent and the outcome of the testing.  Bryce was temporarily discharged home on Friday afternoon (March 30th) while we waited for pathology to come back from the biopsy and bone marrow.  We were all able to spend the Easter weekend together.  Today (Wednesday April 4th) was the treatment meeting with the oncologists. Pathology results were back and Bryce has now officially been diagnosed with Stage 3 Hodgkins Lymphoma. Luckily,  there were no traces in his bone marrow. He was admitted back to Children's Hospital and will start chemotherapy this evening.  He will have at least 4 rounds, 21 days apart. After chemo is completed, there may be a chance that he will also need radiation, which may take an additional 3 weeks. The oncology team is fairly optimistic in regards to treatment and feel that it will be successful.  He does have a long road ahead of him, years even. Bryce is staying pretty positive and is ready to fight. He's been a trooper so far! Shawn and Trisha have been, and will be with him every step of the way.  With that being said, they have already been missing work and will continue to be missing work between and during treatments. The cost of transportation for the 2 hour commute each way for treatments will add up quickly.  Not everyone can give,  and we all understand that. If you are able, any amount is greatly appreciated.  If you can't help financially,  please share and keep Bryce and his family in your prayers as he begins the fight of his life!",bd8be72456685c24e8d6d05620f7b5a3,36,0.439,300.0,2,1,lymphoma,0,2,0,1,0,0.0033222591362126247,0.0,0.8307784791103096,2.0,0.0,gofundme

A 6 month course of chemo was on the cards, and she handled it, and the numerous side effects like a champion! Treatment was initially successful, and the cancer had gone. Unfortunately in December 2017 it returned. It is quite unusual for lymphoma to return so quickly. The next step was to throw everything possible at the cancer. 6 weeks of chemo followed, then a stem cell harvest, 6 days in a row of high dose chemo and finally a stem cell transplant. At this point Alana had almost zero immunity. Alana then contracted a really bad blood infection which resulted in her being placed into ICU. Alana fought hard through the infection and was finally released to go home and rest prior to the commencement of radiation. She was home for two weeks before she started feeling unwell and ended up back in hospital, where she is now, battling pneumonia. The next step for Alana is to beat the pneumonia, get well, and then start her course of radiation. The battle isn't over, but she's not giving up and fighting very hard! Alana has spent her whole life volunteering and working in fields where she is always helping others. Alana has had to take significant amounts of time off work and is out of annual and sick leave.

He suffered the loss of his mother to cancer when a little boy. His father is in fulltime ministry to abolish abortion, so financial struggles were a normal part of growing up. He’s from a large homeschooling family of thirteen brothers and sisters. The youngest of five brothers who all played football, Jeremiah learned to fight. Years of losing on the football field trained him to fight hard. His hard work paid off. He is an all-star, state champion. But it was his love for Jesus and the family ministry to abolish abortion that taught him to fight harder. Now he’s in the battle for his life. In July 2017, Jeremiah rededicated his life to Christ and was baptized at an Operation Save America ministry event in Louisville, Kentucky. In March 2018 he was diagnosed with cancer. The MRI revealed two tumors on Jeremiah’s spine, between zones T6 and T7. Picture a pair of hands pressing together, crushing his nerve endings. These tumors are in addition to the one in his chest. Without surgery, the tumors will cause Jeremiah to be permanently paralyzed from the waist down. With surgery, there is a still risk of paralysis because of the location of the tumors. He can also lose the ability to go to the bathroom normally. Finally, following a successful surgery there is no guarantee that Jeremiah will regain the mobility he’s lost. According to the neurosurgeon this type of surgery has a range of outcomes. Some patients regain the former use of their legs. Others do not. The goal of the surgery is to stop further paralysis.Following the surgery, Jeremiah will then face the monster of cancer. He has a tumor in his chest and two spots on his lungs. Jeremiah is in severe pain, without proper medication. His pain radiates down his back and around his side, so he cannot lie on his back or turn to the side. With the tumor in his chest, he cannot lie on his stomach. Often the only relief he finds is standing- but with the tumors in his back causing paralysis that is no longer possible.But as Jeremiah’s father, Rusty explained to the oncologist, “With God all things are possible.” Jeremiah’s bone cancer is aggressive. Whereas the tumor is his chest was a barely noticeable under his skin, it is now the size of an lemon that can be cupped in a hand. Its growth seems to have happened almost overnight; Jeremiah’s pain is growing too, radiating throughout his body. Jeremiah is a brave young man. There is no anger, self-pity or a woes is me attitude . He is more concerned about how others are feeling. When he sees his mother’s concern, he forces a smile or winks. When he sees a worried friend, he stops what he’s doing to pray for them. He posts daily Scripture verse to encourage those who are praying for him and who are following his story on social media. Jeremiah posted this prayer on Facebook:I don’t deserve Your healing but Lord You will always deserve my praise. Through death or life, may Your great name be lifted up and everything that is of me fall to the waste side. Oh Lord, strengthen me that I may fight the battle with a courage Satan cannot tamper with. If You take me home or leave me here to fight a little longer, may it be Your breath in my lungs and Your song on my tongue. Lord I consecrate myself to the full advancement of the Kingdom of God! Lord, I love You and I can’t wait to see You face to face. Amen.As you can imagine, fighting this battle is taking resources the family doesn’t have. Your love, prayers, and support are greatly appreciated.Matthew 19:26 reads, ""Jesus looked at them and said, 'With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible'.”The Thomas nation’s stand is simply, they are entrusting the life of their son to the Lord. They believe for a miracle. But even if, that does not take place, they want everyone to know, their faith in Jesus Christ is not for sale and non-negotiable.

A...s the headache progressed his parents decided to take him to the emergency room due to it becoming unbearable. While at the ER, the doctors decided to run test to see what the headache was coming from. After hours of tests, scans and biopsies, Ramon and his family lives were turned upside down. It was determined that Ramon, had a tumor located on his Brain called Medulloblastoma, a fast-growing, high grade tumor, located in the Cerebellum. Medulloblastoma accounts for less than 2% of all primary brain tumors and 18% of all pediatric tumors. More than 70% of all pediatric cases are diagnosed in children under age 10. The cause is unknown. Ramon underwent 18 months of treatment, including surgical removal of the tumor, radiation and chemotherapy. It was a success! Ramon was in remission from 2013 to 2015. Now, although in remission, Ramon still had to get scans, and tests to make sure that the Medulloblastoma did not show up again. In 2015, the family was saddened to hear that during some scans, Ramon developed another tumor, this time on his skull. Although the doctors were sure that the tumor was benign, they wanted to go ahead and remove it right away. Ramon had surgery to remove the tumor. After several more scans, they came to find out that the tumor was actually cancerous. This type of cancer is called Osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma starts in the bones. Osterosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer which accounts for about 3% of cancers happening in children. As the doctors were developing a plan for treatment, the noticed a spot located on Ramon’s liver, they were not sure that it was cancer, but they wanted to go ahead and remove it and send it off to be tested. Ramon had surgery to remove the area on his liver and also place his port for Chemo. He had to receive a blood transfusion due to losing so much blood in the process. The surgery was a success!  The doctors ran more test, including on the area found on his liver. 1 to 3% of survivors develop a second cancer different from the originally treated cancer; Ramon has been diagnosed with a third.  The area removed from his liver was a cancerous tumor called Perivascular epithelioid (PEComa). As the other two cancers, PEComa is rare, and the cause is unknown, with less than 40 cases reported in pediatrics. In the literature, 9% of cases occurred as a second malignancy probably because of genomic instability related to treatment. (This seems to be the case here) Adding to this new discovery two more tumors developed on his skull where the incision is, which are Osteosarcoma.  He will undergo 6 months of Chemotherapy in just a few short weeks.  In this process, Ramon has been so strong and in good spirits, He is handling all of this like a champion and is such an inspiration to so many people.",d89a530d52beb48b34b4fbf2a712a1a8,31,0.38885,1350.0,0,1,bone cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

She had what she thought was her last surgery in March and thought that she had ""won and was done"".(Laura smiling even before surgery or during chemo)A few months ago, she began having back pain but thought she had just pulled out her back.  The pain began getting worse.  She finally went to the doctor's and it was originally thought that she possibly had Kidney Stones.  She had an x-ray of her back and an ultrasound of her kidneys but nothing showed up.  But just like the first time 3 years ago, Laura's doctor was diligent and ordered more tests.  Somehow the doctor knew, just like 3 years ago when the first biopsy come up clean, that the initial tests were hiding something. And much to everyone's dismay they were.So on April 29th, her son's 7th birthday, in pure disbelief, Laura received even worse news than having Stage 4 Breast Cancer.  The cancer was back and it was back with a Vengeance. The cancer was now bone cancer and had spread to her spine, possibly neck, her ribs and right hip.  (Luke's 7th Birthday...great times in spite of everything!)She and her family were beyond devastated. She posted on Facebook and shocked us all as well:  ""Yes, it's really true. After 3 years of fighting the good fight, 2 rounds of chemo, radiation and 12 surgeries, the cancer is back and now in my spine. You all know much I'd like to ROAR on through and stay BOSTON STRONG however this time I'm definitely gonna need some help from the Man Above and I will need and I am most certainly asking, more like begging, for prayers. As much as I love God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit, I'm just not ready yet. I want to see my kids grow up a little more. "" - Laura Moscato Spedaliere - 4/30/16 (Laura & her children)What Laura didn't say....and has never said in her effort to keep a positive attitude..... is that in 2016, Laura has lost her home, her job AND her health insurance.  She is trying to get on medicaid but the process is long and complicated.  She is working with the Good Samaritan Foundation just to try and get medication in the meantime. She has had to undergo a battery of tests which has been no small feat considering she no longer has health insurance. They are still trying to determine whether this has hit her organs as well.  All the while, she has always been there for any and all of her friends, even helping to plan her High School's 25th reunion last year.  She knows how to bring a smile to everyone around her.(Laura & her New England Friends)There are so many needs of this family. You know the old saying ""it takes a village""?  Well, we need a village.  We need an army.  We need the help of many.  Help Laura keep fighting. She wants to go HOME to New England to fight this battle at Dana Farber in order to be with her family and also to be surrounded by the love and support of all those that have known her much of her life.  (Pictures of Laura & all her family)Laura has always been an extremely hard worker - working the past 3 years through chemo, radiation and all of the surgeries - but she will probably never be able to work again.  Any type of disability will take anywhere from 5 months  to 2 years to receive.  And that is too long for this family to wait on one income with all of the rising medical costs. Not only is it not even close to what she would make working, with adding her medical bills on top of ot would barely put food on the table.  Last year alone the medical bills were over $17,000.00 and keep in mind that was only ONE year and she has been fighting for 3 years. She is also loving wife.  She supports her husband Rich in any way possible with his radio show Spitz on Sports. Anything from promoting him, to advertisting materials and just bragging about his Mad Sports Talking Skills!! (Laura & her husband Rich)But most importantly, she is a devoted MOM.  She identifies herself as a mom above all else and has 2 children: Sammie who is 17, about to graduate High School and venture off to college and Lucas who is only 7.  It is hard enough to come up with money for college for your child, never mind when you can't work, have HUGE medical bills and your future is unknown.  Add on top of that a YOUNG child, one that they waited many years for, who is only in the 1st grade.  Anyone who know her, knows that Laura always tries to remain strong especially for her ""kiddos"" but I myself cannot imagine the thought of trying to fight so hard, worry about money, housing, college expenses, healthcare and still have the nagging though of possibly leaving behind 2 young children if she can't get help in fighting this battle.(Laura & her kiddos)In her strength, Laura also said ""The bottom line is - medical opinion is that my cancer is not curable......But I am going to remain BOSTON STRONG as always and ROAR right along and make sure that I am certainly at Lucas's high school graduation........ I am confident with the love and support that everyone has given me and with God on my side and the Holy Spirit in me, I will conquer this and be the exception to the rule.

cancer for over a year. Trey has Osteosarcoma, which is a rare bone cancer that
has spread to his lungs and developed into lung cancer. He is the
oldest child to a single mother (Ms. Kimberly Sampson), and has two younger
sisters which are 8 and 11 years old. Tremaine had his arm amputated and part
of his lung removed as a result of cancer. He has had a total of four lung
surgeries over the past year, the most recent surgery taking place on September
9th. Tremaine was told by his doctors there is not much more they can do to
treat the Osteosarcoma and it will take Trey's life. Despite a negative
prognosis, Trey remains a unbelievably strong young man.  He is the definition of a ""fighter"" and a hero among his peers as he lives his life to the fullest and makes each day count. Tremaine had the opportunity to run the opening

I remember her having a hard time explaining to me where it was originating from. She didn’t think too much of it, thinking maybe she pulled a muscle or something simple like that, figuring that it would go away soon. This persisted and so she finally decided to see her doctor. Over the course of several weeks and multiple tests, even an ultrasound, nothing presented itself as the cause.During that process, it came time for Shellie to have her routine mammogram. Some days after the mammogram, Shellie was contacted and was told that they found something that “was normal for women her age but, to be sure they wanted to schedule a biopsy.” What was odd is that they also wanted to schedule a follow up appointment with a surgeon. After this call, Shellie called a friend in the medical field, told her what was said and she told Shellie that they don’t do that unless they found something serious. The results from the biopsy were due to be in sometime on Friday March 9th. Waiting all day, Shellie decided to call. By this time it was around 4:30 PM. She was unable to get anyone willing to give her the results over the phone. 3/12 8:30 AM, Monday: appointment with the surgeon. The surgeon came in, introduced himself and began to speak to Shellie as if she had received the results from the biopsy. “…with your diagnosis…” Shellie, “wait, what diagnosis?” Surgeon, “Oh….you don’t know? You have breast cancer.” Lobular carcinoma. This cancer feeds on estrogen. He preceded to tell us that it’s slow growing, and caught “early.” Bad news…but goods news too. Very treatable. Not a death sentence. Then he went on to tell us what her options were surgically. Lumpectomy or mastectomy/bi-lateral mastectomy. All the pros and cons for both options, etc. Also, if bi-lateral is chosen, talked about reconstruction surgery. After an hour of discussion, he said, “You need to decide what you want to do,” Shocked and emotional to say the least. Shellie was already leaning strongly towards a bi-lateral mastectomy to eliminate the possibility of the cancer returning to any remaining breast tissue and having to go through this all over again at some point down the road. He then mentioned he would get Shellie an appointment with a plastic surgeon to be informed about all that is involved with reconstructive surgery. That was set for 3/22.A day or two later we were informed that they “need more information” and rushed an MRI appointment. 3/15 Thursday: MRI. Imaging of both breasts to see if cancer was in left breast too. Also, if Shellie decides on a lumpectomy they needed “margins.”3/19 Monday: Received call on MRI findings. They told us that they are “all scratching their heads,” because they felt the MRI would answer the questions they had but, it did not. They found a cyst that is attached to Shellie’s sternum. Also, that there looks like there may be cancer in the left breast as well. They said that they needed a CT/PET scan for a “clear” picture of where the cancer is. They ordered the CT/PET scan ASAP/soonest possible opening.3/21 Wednesday: CT/PET scan. Shellie was injected with a dye that attaches to cancer cells. Had the scans and then we headed home.3/22 Thursday 1:30 PM: Plastic surgeon appointment. An hour drive. We had just been called in with the surgeons nurse and while she was gathering information we received a call from Shellie’s doctor, the surgeon that would be performing the bi-lateral, if that was what she was to decide on having. He informed Shellie that he had the results from the CT/PET scan. The nurse gave us the room and we put him on speaker so we could both listen. I tell you, this was the worst moment of my life. I’m sure Shellie would likely agree that it is hers as well. He said, “you have stage 4 bone cancer,” and, “your skeleton lit up!” “It’s inoperable, incurable.” “Surgery is not an option now.” “I’m very sorry about the timing, if we had the results sooner, you wouldn’t have had to drive all the way to Clackamas for this Plastic surgery consult. You won’t be having surgery.” “I’m so sorry.” I was looking at Shellie as she began to cry, both of us in disbelief. We both began to sob. He told us that this is out of his hands now and that he is referring us to oncology and asked us if we had any questions. I asked him, “if she’s does nothing, what is her life expectancy?” He said, “two…maybe three years.” There were a couple other questions but I don’t remember what they were. We had the room alone for a few minutes after the call was over. We just cried. The nurse returned briefly to tell us that the plastic surgeon had just been informed, but he would still like to speak to us if that was okay. He was very kind. Very sorry that we had received such news. Asked us if there was anything, anything at all that he could do for us. That was very nice of him, but he doesn’t have the power to give us what we need.We’re now members of a club we didn’t choose to join. A monster has come into our lives and it is bent on taking Shellie from us. How did this happen? Why? Shellie has a bone biopsy scheduled for Monday morning, 3/26. They don’t know if the breast cancer moved to the bones or if it is a different cancer. She has an appointment with oncology Tuesday 3/27. Oncology will likely push one of, or a combination of a chemo estrogen inhibitor treatment, and other drugs or radiation. Probably push hard and fast. On Tuesday 3/27, there will be a board meeting at Kaiser and Shellie’s case will be discussed. They keep saying, “we’re all scratching our heads.” After each diagnosis, they had an idea of how to proceed, but each new test only added more confusion and more unanswered questions.We have chosen to fight this seemingly unbeatable monster. Whatever we can do to prolong Shellie’s life, we are willing to do. We have no medical bills thus far. Our medical insurance covers 100%. However, we have been researching natural methods that have had much success. We know of a number of people that have had very good results. Shellie has personally spoken to a woman that had received a very dire prognosis with colon cancer and aggressive lung cancer. She is still alive more then 15 years later and is cancer free. Of course, our insurance does not cover this type of treatment.            This is why I am asking for help. We don’t have the money that we need to try to give us more time. Blood work has shown that Shellie’s organs are still healthy. All her blood work results came back all within normal limits. They are saying no cancer in her organs. She is strong! As soon as we can, we need to get Shellie to The Hoxsey Clinic in Mexico.  http://www.hoxseybiomedical.com We need money for travel expenses, for the initial visit at the clinic of about $60, $1800-$2300 to be paid up front for the first 6 months of treatment, only IF the Hoxsey clinic tells us they can help her. Shellie has to radically change her diet. I don’t know yet what that entails yet but I don’t think that will impact us financially too much. This treatment will be ongoing. We need about $3000 as soon as April 20th. We want to get Shellie to the clinic as soon as possible.Please help us! Any amount that you can personally give will add up. If nothing else, please include us in your prayers. I will update every week or more often when ever there is any more information to share. Many of you are finding out about this through this effort, and for that I am truly sorry. We have called family members and many friends with this news and, as you can imagine, it is very time consuming and emotionally exhausting. We love all of you and hope that you can understand why I am doing this. Please feel free to contact us directly if you have our numbers. Or, direct message us through Instagram @paul_shelliemay_nicholas to get our contact information.

In February, Janelle fell outside our home on her way to class and began having pain in her lower back. After a month or so she went to the hospital to see what was wrong, as it couldn’t possibly be from falling a month prior. Doctors thought it was a bruised bone, maybe a slipped disk, or possibly a kidney infection... Come April, after spending 10 days at Mass General Hospital, undergoing multiple scans and tests, Janelle had a biopsy done revealing the pain was from cancer. She was diagnosed with Ewing’s Sarcoma, an extremely rare bone cancer most often found in children and adolescents. When I found out it was cancer, I said to myself, “Of all people to get cancer… I am absolutely stunned it’s Janelle.” If there is a poster child for healthy living and positive energy, it would be her. Before her diagnosis, Janelle was either at the yoga studio, tearin’ up the mountains in the winter, whipping up a delicious healthy (usually vegan) meal in our kitchen, or hanging with friends at the Ski and Board house. She also spent the last two years working with the UMass Amherst based nonprofit, Protect Our Breasts, an organization that focuses on sharing the conversation about chemicals in products that contribute to cancer, and empowering women to make safer choices to protect their health. Janelle is currently the co-president of the UMass Ski and Board Club, and will be beginning her senior year online this fall.  Janelle is still on track to graduate from UMass Amherst in May 2019. As Janelle continues this long journey, she needs your help! She is currently receiving treatment and going through rounds of chemotherapy at Mass General Hospital in Boston. Her treatment is extremely rigorous, tiring, and will be ongoing for the unforeseeable future. Once she is done with chemo, she will most likely need additional treatments such as a bone marrow transplants and clinical trials. Janelle and her family greatly appreciate your support in her fight against cancer. We thank you for your positive thoughts and any contribution to her fund.  To follow Janelle’s journey, check out her blog at  https://climbingontrees.com #TeamJanelle #BeatSarcoma #StrongerThanSarcoma",27b087544bfc8f5fad36d33cfeaab296,17,1.01354,210.0,4,1,bone cancer,1,1,2,1,1,0.002617801047120419,0.005235602094240838,0.7092355280600973,1.0,2.0,gofundme

Bone cancer can affect any breed of dog, but it is more commonly found in the larger and older breeds (especially rottweilers).  The bone cancer is extremely aggressive and has a tendency to metastasize rapidly into other parts of the dog's body (ex. their lungs).With the small window we have to try and save Apollo's life, the best recommendation by the Oncologist and Surgeon was to amputate his leg to get rid of the tumor and from it metastasizing.  It was probably the most difficult descision we've ever had to make, but it had to be done to give Apollo a chance to live longer.On March 11, 2015, Apollo had his front left leg amputated at the Hope Center in Vienna.  He had to stay over night at the vet hospital for them to monitor his condition.  The next evening we were able to take him home and he is doing much better now.  Apollo is learning to walk with three legs and is adapting well so far.  Apollo will need to go through about 4-6 rounds of chemotherapy (every three weeks) to help kill the cancer cells that may have spread to other parts of his body to extend his life expectancy.  Each session of chemo ranges about $800-$1,000.  Apollo is the love of our lives and our best friend so we are doing everything we can to extend his time with us.  Thank you for any and all support and generosity here on gofundme.  Apollo, Tommy and I will be forever in your debt.Love,Apollo, Tommy & Nancy",ad96ee3f327c2a2ab8711491d9ae9700,18,1.0,1410.0,3,1,bone cancer,1,1,0,1,0,0.00267379679144385,0.0,0.027805864509605663,1.9562091862214102,0.0,gofundme

She had a double mastectomy and lymph node removal and underwent chemotherapy radiation for a year. She was proclaimed cancer free but then three months ago she was rushed to hospital due to extreme pain and was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in her liver and bones. She again underwent chemotherapy and the cancer in her liver has shrunk and the bone cancer has not progressed. Today unfortunately they found cancer lesions on her brain that they plan on treating with radiation. She will have to have radiation treatments 5 days a week for an unknown amount of time.

In simpler terms, Bone Cancer in my right knee. I went through a year of chemotherapy and knee replacement surgery. The cancer was defeated but the titanium knee did not react well with my skin which left oozing sores. After a year of surgeries attempting to save the titanium knee I was forced with the decision to amputate or fuse it straight. I chose the fusion, they used a donor bone and steel plates to secure my leg. From start to finish I was on crutches for 4 years straight! My freshman year of High School I was able to walk without them. Fast forward 15 years later I've not let the fused knee slow me down and had an active lifestyle. Two weeks ago I somehow contracted a bacterial skin infection in my fused leg. I immediately went to see my original surgeon in Indianapolis. I was prescribed oral antibiotics and told they should take care of it, and to come back in a week.I came back for my follow up and the infection developed areas of concern and I was admitted to the hosipital unexpectedly. They performed an IND or clean out of my leg and are concerned about the hardware being infected. I work for a small local IT business and do not have health insurance. That's why I need assistance. I'm not normally the type to ask for help, but I'm laying in the hospital as the bills and procedures pile up. I've now had two surgergies and have been in my room for 5 days.  When I return home I will need IV Antibiotics that will need purchased up front. My case manager said the Antibiotics will be expensive. I do not have the funds to get them. Without them I'm told I may lose my leg, so I'm asking for anything you can spare to help me get through this.

Just a few days ago my uncle was found in a pool of blood in his residence where he lived by himself due to work. He was rushed to the ER in El Paso, TX, where he was found to have a broken back, in which x-rays showed that this was due to multiple tumors within his spine. It was determined that he has very advanced bone cancer, multiple myeloma, and does not have high chances of living much longer with only a 5% chance of his cancer to going into remission with treatment.

My aunt Nancy has been footing hotel, food, and other expenses for herself, my grandmother, my uncle, his wife and three children that he will likely leave behind due to his condition. Doctors highly suggested he see top specialists in Dallas, Texas however, without insurance the cost of any and all medical treatment, and any moving and living expenses for his  wife and three children has fallen on us. We are hoping and praying for any aid possible. We are not asking for any handouts, we just want to ensure that he and his family be given a chance. With successful treatment he would have at least 2-4 years to live, but it is not promised. Thank you for your time and consideration. ANYTHING HELPS. We only have about a week before he is released from the hospital and have to move his things out of his residence, find somewhere for he and his family to live in Dallas, find transport from El Paso to Dallas, medical equipment, and food for his family, and medical bills.

Her doctor ordered it but her insurance company, Molina Marketplace, wouldn't approve it until she went through 6 weeks of physical therapy before she could have the test done. Meanwhile, her leg use rapidly deteriorated and she went from having a mild limp to using a cane to get around to being on crutches, her knee pain becoming more and more unbearable.In the past several weeks her knee has doubled in size. When she was able to finally get the MRI, it indicated that she had some sort of mass or tumor in her knee. The insurance company was still delaying her treatment and her PCP blew it off as well. She finally checked herself into the ER with MRI results in hand and now she is finally being taken seriously. She was admitted and has had several tests, including a bone scan and a biopsy. It is bone cancer and the tumor is growing aggressively. The treatment plan most likely will include several months of chemotherapy and surgeries. This has come as a major shock to us all. Her and her husband Kyle bought a house before this diagnosis and it is not move in ready by any means. There is a lot of work to be done. There is no bathroom on the first floor, which she will need since she cannot climb the stairs among various other repairs needed to make it livable. It will also need to be disinfected and kept that way while she is in chemotherapy since she needs a somewhat sterile environment to be in during that time. They really need all of the help they can right now. Her insurance coverage with their bronze plan from Molina Marketplace is not great and we do not know at this time what they will cover. Updates will be made as they are known.",595f18cfff5384bbb3163ef9ea8178bd,17,1.1633,600.0,3,1,bone cancer,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

He made it all the way to the top and back down safely. Shortly after coming down from the mountain, he started feeling a slight discomfort in his right foot. It didn't feel too painful and he figured maybe it was just a tough hike. Unfortunately, the discomfort never really went away and it kept coming back occasionally. A few months later, Luis reached out to his doctor who referred him to a Podiatrist for a checkup. Based on his symptoms, the Podiatrist told him that it was most likely Plantar Fasciitis and asked him to get shoes with solid soles, a pair of insoles and a night splint. Luis immediately went out and purchased the recommended items and followed his doctor's instructions. After a few weeks, Luis felt like these modifications helped the pain a little bit, but it wasn't really getting better. After going back to the doctor, he was ordered to get X-rays. This is when the doctor noticed that there was an abnormal section on the bone of his foot and asked him to get an MRI scan to further look into this. The doctor then referred him to an Orthopedic Oncologist who has determined that Luis has bone cancer in his foot. Unfortunately, the damage is too extensive and the best course of action will be amputation. Surgery has been scheduled for this Friday, November 17th. Luis will also be undergoing a PET scan soon to see if the cancer has spread.Due to these very unfortunate circumstances, Luis will have a lot of unforeseen medical expenses coming up in the very near future.  In that Luis devotes his life to helping others, I would like us all to rally together and give back to him in his time of need.  Please find it in your heart to donate whatever you can to show our support for our very kind friend, Luis.  He is very appreciative for the outpouring of love and support and it is helping him get through these very dark times.  Thank you in advance for your support!",833d25138a21c14d66741b5dd4576b63,19,0.7824,450.0,3,1,bone cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

Danielle currently lives in Goddard, KS with her husband, Tyler and their two year old daughter, Taylor.It all started seven years ago when Tyler noticed a strange mole on Danielle's back. She went to a dermatologist who took a biopsy of the mole and said it was benign. Within a year, the mole had grown back and still looked odd. They decided to get a second opinion at a different dermatology clinic where a biopsy was found to be melanoma. Surgery was performed in the fall of 2011 to remove the melanoma and pathology results deemed that no further treatment was required. Danielle underwent several scans that failed to find any other areas of cancer. She has kept appointments at the dermatologist every six months since, which have found no new sites of melanoma on her skin. After 5 years being clear of melanoma, Danielle was considered cured of the disease. Danielle and Tyler welcomed a healthy baby girl, Taylor, in June 2015. This past December, Danielle became pregnant with twins. She was having a more symptomatic pregnancy this time; feeling more fatigued and having a hard time finding her words.  When Tyler arrived home from work on April 29th, he found her unable to speak a single phrase. They immediately went to the hospital where they found that Danielle had three brain masses and two masses in her abdominal wall. On May 1st, Danielle underwent brain surgery to remove the masses. Two days later, the abdominal masses were also removed. All were found to be melanoma, likely spread from the original mole. Danielle came home on May 5th and has recovered well from surgery. The twins were monitored frequently in the hospital and are also doing well. They have had appointments with several doctors who are trying to develop the best plan for Danielle and the babies. Danielle and Tyler went to MD Anderson in Houston to meet with a melanoma specialist who will continue to communicate with Danielle's oncologist in Wichita so she can receive treatment here. In the first few weeks of June, Danielle received radiation on the sites of the removed brain masses. She had full body MRI scans that unfortunately showed more growth in her body. Danielle was positive for a specific medication and is able to receive limited treatment while pregnant. Finally good news!The twins will be delivered early in the beginning of July so Danielle can start full treatment. The twins will be born at 29 weeks and will spend a few months in the NICU. Each placenta will be tested for melanoma, which, in rare cases, may spread to babies. Please share Danielle's story so others will become more aware of this disease and take necessary action to prevent it. It seems that skin cancer is often seen as easily treatable and not a serious issue, which is obviously not the case.Danielle, Tyler, Taylor and the twins are very humbled by your generosity and are thankful to everyone who has helped!

This time he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure.  At the prime age of 57, that's extremely scary. Being told to prepare for the worst, is hard news to swallow. Days in the hospital and being watched carefully. Some of the fluid disapated and he was given (lent) a external defibrillator just so he can live.  He had to stop working and over doing it. Jeff has always been a very active man, but having to stop working has made the thought ""how do I pay for things, until my disability starts?"" Waiting on disability can take weeks, sometimes even months. With Jeff not being able to work, it affects Diane's  (his wife) medical too. She to has heart issues and has a pace maker implanted and recovering from skin cancer among other medical issues she and Jeff are on routine medicines. With no income that will put stress and worry on how they'll get their meds. Medicine is essential for them BOTH. By donating it helps Diane to.
As for Jeff his doctor told him he needs to be on the external defibrillator for a few months and then reevaluate his heart to get an internal defibrillator put in, but that comes at a price.
Jeff will lose his insurance through work by August 1st.  It's company policy to only allow insurance to continue for only 60days after your stop working. Well to come up with a deposit for the internal defibrillator is another worry.  
Jeff has many years in him, he has a wife, 4 daughters, and 12 grandchildren and 2 sisters that still very much need him around. He has a will and want to stay alive. He's a very head strong Marine, that needs a bit of help now. PLEASE consider donating  ANY amount to help save Jeff's HEART ❤. He needs a internal defibrillator to stay alive.

Many Blessings

This journey all started when I had a tooth ache and I looked in the mirror to see if it was infected, that’s when I noticed a large mass in the back of my throat with a small hole in it . So I immediately went to the dentist to see if it was tooth related and my Dentist told me to immediately go see a ENT of course that’s when I started to sweat ! Then the next day I went to the emergency room and spent all day doing test . They sent me to get a CT scan  that’s when they discovered a large mass in the back of  my throat next to my tonsils. They then took me to a small room in the emergency room and told me they had a couple of ENT Doctors coming to talk to me so they ran a little scope up my nose which didn’t feel pleasant at all.  That’s when I asked the infamous question “do you think it’s cancer ?”and one of the Doctors replies there is a strong possibility that it is but of course we need to do a biopsy to confirm this! Then they told me that they would set an appointment within the next couple of weeks for the Biopsy! And of course that’s when the fear and emotions set in when I had to call my parents with this news ... let me put it this way talking was very difficult at that moment  One of the Doctors asked if he could get a pic of my mass with a hole in it so he could show the attending Doctor a pic !! Well I’m on my way to checkout of the emergency room when the nurse told me they want to see me first thing Monday morning and that’s the moment I started to really freak out!! So I  had to wait until Monday  to have my biopsy done!! Let me tell you that was the longest weekend of my life !! So Monday finally came and my wonderful sisters Robin and Pam came to my appointment with me and witnessed me about to jump out of my chair when they started to cut two pieces of the mass from my mouth for testing ! Then I had to wait about a week for the results! Imagine a lion in a cage pacing back and forth ...yup that was me! Then the result were squamous cell carcinoma which is a skin cancer in my throat!  My first thought was am I going to die from this !! Only God knows the answer to that! But my chances do look good !! So after months of different appointments, I’m ready for treatment that starts next week on 8/21 and I will get 60 doses of radiation and 3 treatments of chemo and a total life reset of what I put in my mouth and drink since I will be very limited as to eating solid foods for a long time. I may need a food tube if I can’t get enough nutrients and or loose too much weight.  I have no source of income while I go through this I’m about to loose my personal items in storage and have already lost my car! So I’m asking for your prayers and donations to help me get through this rough time in my life!! I know with God’s favor and my friends and family’s support, I will get through this scary journey I’m about to start .. so please pray for me and if able, donate whatever you can to help me pay for a juicer and organic foods and my bills until I’m able to work again .I would like to thank God and my wonderful family and friends for there words of encouragement and support through this difficult journey in my life!Chuck Nichols",4ba035635bb9b4c6eb98932e1092bf86,24,0.12,270.0,1,1,skin cancer,0,0,3,0,1,0.0,0.004424778761061947,0.030109489051094892,0.0,3.0,gofundme

Initially, we thought it was scrape that became infected. But it would not heal even with prescription cream and ear drops recommended by three different doctors whom diagnosed that it was fungal infection. Since we did not have medical insurance at the time, and did not qualify for Oregon state assistance programs that reduce medical bills and other expenses, we used our savings to pay for the doctor visits and medicines. Seeing a specialist, like an ENT, was not finacially possible anymore. This past April (2014), after our insurance became effective, we were referred to an ENT. The doctor suspected Jim might have skin cancer. Two biopcies confirmed that Jim did have skin cancer (Squamous Cell Carcinoma). Due to the the size of the open wound, they would have to remove Jim's ear. The news came to us as shocking as anyone could image. Living your life with only one ear may seem like ""It just takes time; you will learn how to live with it, and get used to it."" But for Jim, living with one ear was like a death senstence. For those of you who have had the pleasure to get to know Jim over the years, you know that he is one of a kind musician. The way he plays music MOVES people's heart and soul. For Jim, music gives life. Living with one ear as a musician would be like taking away life force to him. We have sought for a few alternative treatments to heal Jim's body WITHOUT removing his ear. However, our insurance does not cover any of it. Though I have been working full time, Jim's illness has kept him from doing anything, music included--the daily pain keeps him from even listening to the music!! We are looking forward to the day when Jim is fully recovered, and enjoying simple things in life...as simple as strolling in the neighborhood with me!! We are raising $30,000, and are asking for you to contribute in any way you can. The fund will pay for treatments, such as accupuncture sessions, and visits with Chinese Medicine Practician.Jim is a great soul, kind hearted (especially with animals) with a great sense of humor. He is so brave to be in the unknown.

As he continues to receive chemo for the second round, he was told he now also has skin cancer.  My family tries to encourage him, there are many people praying, but his body will never be ""normal"" again.  I had always seen a fearless and strong man who rarely ever shed a tear.  But now, I can see the fear in his eyes.  His tears well up easier now knowing there is harsher treatment to come.  But my daddy still does not ask for a dime or for extra help from any of us, because he knows we don't really have much to give.  I help with food and small amounts monetarily when I can, but it does not help lower the large medical bills that have no end in sight.  My mom has been very supportive and does all she can to help and comfort him.  Nonetheless, my dad worries about the medical bills piling up.  The fact that he can no longer work a full time schedule has hit him hard financially.  My mom cannot physically help financially and each one of us, though employed, are barely making it to pay for college and expenses, marriage and a new baby and single parenting.  We are asking for financial help for my parents to get through this difficult time.  Any amount that you can find in your hearts to give would be greatly appreciated.  Your prayers are also very much appreciated. May God bless you greatly.""",ee239a313a1e6ad7d4c178663f7fbbbd,61,0.42,1410.0,0,1,mixed,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

En Febrero de 2.015 noté que un lunar que siempre había tenido en mi pecho, encima del seno izquierdo comenzó a crecer. Al percatarme de esto fui de inmediato al Medico Dermatólogo, quien decidió retirarme el lunar, sin realizarle una biopsia, en ese momento mi conocimiento sobre el tema era neófito y escaso, por lo que confié en las decisiones del médico.  Hoy en día me doy cuenta que el procedimiento aplicado fue negligente, ya que dicho lunar tenía todas las características de un Melanoma (Cáncer de piel), tenía bordes irregulares, era de color oscuro y estaba cambiando de tamaño.  En Octubre de 2017, la zona donde se encontraba mi lunar se enrojeció, comencé a sentir molestia y un pequeño quiste debajo de la piel, y además note que tenía unos ganglios recrecidos y endurecidos en mi axila izquierda, ya para este momento mi temor fue mayor y recurrí de inmediato a un doctor internista, quien al examinarme, con su experiencia y tomando en cuenta la información de mi historia médica previa actuó de inmediato e hizo una punción en los ganglios para realizarles una biopsia, la cual lamentablemente arrojo como resultado la presencia de células cancerosas. Dado a los resultados obtenidos, continuaron haciéndome otros exámenes complementarios y con el apoyo de varios doctores, concluyeron que era un Melanoma (cáncer de piel), ubicado donde estaba inicialmente el lunar, el cual en su desarrollo hizo metástasis en ganglios cercanos.  Con este diagnóstico contundente para el mes de noviembre de 2017, decidieron realizarme una operación en Diciembre del mismo año para retirarme la lesión y hacerme un vaciado axilar de los ganglios, con el fin de limitar la expansión del cáncer y comenzar un nuevo proceso para mejorar mi salud. Ya para el mes de enero del presente año el doctor me indicó, que como continuación del proceso de mejora de mi salud es imperativo y determinante realizarme un tratamiento llamado Inmunoterapia, con el fin de aumentar mis defensas ante cualquier reinicio de ciclo o reaparición del cáncer, para este tratamiento de Inmunoterapia, necesito comprar 8 ampollas de Nivolumab (opdivo) de 40 mg, medicamento sumamente costoso y delicado debido a su cadena de refrigeración, el cual no pude conseguir en mi pais.Mi vida está en alto riesgo y el tiempo corre en mi contra, es por ello que me he movilizado a Estados Unidos, lugar donde me garantizan el suministro de las medicinas, así como su aplicación y todo el soporte necesario, pero a un alto costo.  Es por eso que en este momento recurro a ustedes para solicitarles su apoyo en virtud de mejorar mi salud y continuar con mi vida… de hija… de madre y en fin con mis sueños de mujer… Te pido ayuda en la medida de tus posibilidades para así lograr reunir el monto que requiero para realizarme el tratamiento, que incluye, comprar las dosis exactas de medicinas requeridas, los costos de aplicación, cubrir los exámenes complementarios, especiales y de seguimiento.  Mi familia y yo agradecemos sus oraciones y valoramos sus acciones y generosidad.  Muchas gracias y que Dios los bendiga!Para contacto o donaciones... escribeme al correo flormaria29@hotmail.com Hello friends ... My name is Flor Maria Lugo, a daughter and 44 years old Venezuelan mother. In February of 2015 I noticed that a mole that I had always had on my chest, on top of the left breast began to grow. When I noticed this I immediately went to the Dermatologist, who decided to remove the mole, without performing a biopsy, at that time I didn’t know anything about the subject of skin cancer and so I relied on the doctor's decision of not performing a biopsy. Today I realize that the procedure applied was negligent, since the mole had all the characteristics of a melanoma (skin cancer), had irregular edges, was dark and was changing in size. In October of 2017, I realized that the area where my mole was, was reddened, I began to feel discomfort and a small cyst under the skin, and also noticed that I had enlarged and hardened ganglia in my left armpit, this scared me and so I immediately went to an internist who, upon examining me, with his experience and taking into account the information in my previous medical history, acted immediately and punctured the lymph nodes to perform a biopsy, which unfortunately resulted in the presence of cancer cells. Given the results obtained, they continued doing other complementary tests and with the support of several doctors, they concluded that it was a Melanoma (skin cancer), located where the mole was initially, which in its development metastasized into nearby lymph nodes. With this conclusive diagnosis for the month of November of 2017, they decided to perform an operation in December of the same year to remove the injury and make an axillary drainage of the lymph nodes, in order to limit the spread of cancer and start a new process to improve my health. Already for the month of January of this year the doctor told me, as a continuation of the process of improving my health is imperative and decisive to perform a treatment called Immunotherapy, in order to increase my defenses before any restart of the cycle or reappearance of cancer, for this treatment of Immunotherapy, I need to buy 8 ampoules of Nivolumab (opdivo) of 40 mg, an extremely expensive and delicate medicine due to its refrigeration chain, which I could not get in my country.My life is at high risk and time runs against me, that is why I have come to the United States, where I am guaranteed the supply of medicines, as well as its application and all the necessary support, but at a high cost. That is why at this moment I appeal to you to ask for your support in virtue of improving my health and continuing with my life ... as a daughter ... as a mother and finally as a woman ... I ask for your help to the extent of your possibilities in order to achieve the amount I need to complete the treatment, which includes buying the exact doses of medicines required, the costs of application, covering the complementary, special and follow-up exams.

A battery of medical tests, scans & procedures led to major surgery in September & the new reality of life with Nodular Melanoma - the most aggressive & lethal form of skin cancer.Although surgery removed the initial tumor from my back, the doctors counselled for frequent exams, due to the aggressive nature of the disease & its potential to rapidly spread throughout my body. Early detection is key! Every 3 months, I would be examined & any new disease assessed. Ideally, from the time of first diagnosis & treatment, you are aiming for what's called, ""NED"" or ""No Evidence Of Disease."" It is a 5-year objective that all cancer survivors are aiming for, praying for! Any recurrence of cancer, especially within the first 18-24 months carries with it a much higher risk for worsening outcomes. Unfortunately, that is now my experience, as several new tumors on my chest & left ear have been detected & require major surgery. I am asking for your prayers & for your help, through this gofundme account.Up until now, my wife & I have shouldered the mounting expenses of treatment, at a cost of almost $50,000 over the course of just this past year! We have had to make financial arrangements with doctors, surgeons, dermatologists, anaesthesiologists, medical groups, imaging centers, pathology labs & hospitals, just to send small payments (usually $25-75 per month, each) as indication of our sincere intent to honor our debts. These are the crucial Care Providers, so integral to my battle with cancer - I am grateful to them all! As an example of the on-going financial challenges (even with decent health insurance), in the last 3 weeks, alone I have incurred almost $6,000 in cost for scans & the major surgery I am scheduled for, next Thursday, 08/18/16.Faith, family & close friends have been the lifeline of support, these past 12 months of my rollercoaster ride. I thank God for each & every kindness extended toward me & my family! My wife & children have been incredibly strong throughout, even as we grapple with the uncertainties of the future. We are trusting, we are hoping & we are fighting!Will you please fight with me? I would be so grateful for any assistance you feel led to offer. On behalf of my family & from the depth of my heart, I thank you.",1051fc5b056ed06083492c073ec779c6,18,0.8704,900.0,2,1,mixed,0,3,0,3,0,0.0069124423963133645,0.0,0.6919152276295133,3.6340159769978557,0.0,gofundme

My brother, Jay Hibbitts, is 40 years old and an avid fisherman and outdoorsman. He loves boating, music, spending time with his family, singing karaoke, and exploring new amusement parks with his wife, son, and newphew. He also enjoys bringing new life to things by venturing into gardening, growing things, a love for animals, and creating his own homemade wines and most recently making his own beers. Jay has worked full-time for a large chain bakery for many years. His health coverage has always been adequate; however, recently, he was concerned about something that looked kind of like a pimple on the back of his left elbow that turned into looking like a wart. He treated it for several months with wart treatment. However, the wart did not go away and became increasingly painful. Jay went to the regular doctor two months ago and was referred to a dermatologist. Jay went to the dermatologist the following week and had the wart removed.On Monday, March 26, 2018, Jay heard back from the dermatologist who was very concerned and indicated that the results came back, and the findings were shocking and unexpected to him and our family. The doctor said that it was squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common form of skin cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells arising in the squamous cells, which can often look like  warts. They can become disfiguring and sometimes deadly if allowed to grow. Squamous cell carcinomas detected at an early stage and removed promptly are almost always curable and cause minimal damage. However, left untreated, they eventually penetrate the underlying tissues and can become disfiguring. A small percentage even metastasize to local lymph nodes, distant tissues, and organs and can become fatal.Jay needs to have additional treatment to go in deeper to remove all remaining squamous cells to avoid the cancer spreading. Removing the wart from the surface was not enough. The dermatologist needs to go in  further down and cut out all of the squamous cells. His insurance requires that a deductible be met before he could receive such treatment. Our family asked me to create this page in hopes of receiving support to help Jay meet the deductible, so the remaining squamous cells can be cut out and removed, minimizing the risk of growth and speading.We appreciate anything you can offer moneitarily. If you are unable to give, we would appreciate your love and prayers during this difficult time and please share this page.Sincerely,Jay's sister,Bobbi Jo Smith",6c47260aad81b6c54b9e2b3b6c9ab3bc,22,1.025,300.0,4,1,skin cancer,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

See her story below.""As much as I told myself I wouldn't put certain things on FB, I have decided it would make my life easier than answering a million more questions with the same answers i have already given over and over. So...here it is for all to read. I'll try to make it short and not leave missing parts.I had a spot on my leg something like a freckle or beauty mark that got a little bigger over time. In early Dec. I saw a dermatologist who removed it. 2 weeks later Joe and I had a follow up to look at the dime sized wound from the cut. It was then that we met with another dermatologist who stated that she did not have good news for us 6 days before Christmas. We were told that I have Melanoma cancer. This cancer we are told is very rare and at my age. In fact it makes up only 5% of skin cancers but has a mortality rate of 80% . We were able to go on, have a wonderful family Christmas and more. My dermatologist pulled some strings and got me into The Dana Farber Institute in Boston in only a couple weeks time. Since then Joe and i have had to make the trip many times and although they are long, tiresome and stressful, the oncology team I have, make the effort worth it. Here's what been done in a very short amount of time. Testing, lots of testing. Pet scans, catscan combined, Brain MRI, dye testing to see where the melanoma site has drained to. Stage testing and 3 very saddening surgical procedures all done in one day. With the assistance from a plastic surgeon I have had a large incision and cancer site removal on my lower left calf. This is something that will take a while to emotionally heal as well as physically. No one wants large scars or imperfections no matter the battle or story. I had a very deep node removal in my upper thigh which now has me prisoner to my home as a saroma ( painful fluid build up ) has developed. It is extremely hard to walk and painful. I also have a 10 inch incision on my stomach where they were planning on using it as a skin graph an then did not. So here's where we are...Joe Taylor and I found out on February 1st that I have Stage 3 B + , Melanoma. This type of Cancer is at it's worst at stage 4. It is staged in 2 parts basically size of the spot and depth and then where is has spread. In my case, it has spread to my lymphnodes. I have more appointments for more scans, and testing to find out if it has effected other parts of my body such as organs etc. I am scheduled to see the Medical Oncologist in only a few short days to begin my journey of treatments. I am also scheduled for a bone scan of the skull as they found a 5mm mass in my orbital bone marrow and need to find out what this is. In the meantime, it's rest, elevation, pain meds, Ice, stomach shots and lots of boredom wile being anxious. So there is is, cancer is quiet. Listen to your body, get checked. So there you have it, my embarrassing tell all that I will never understand why me? I look forward to returning to work, being me again and I'm happy to say as hard as this has all been, I truly am not going through this all alone despite those who never showed up or couldn't make a little bit of time for me. Lastly, the responses, I appreciate the kind words but, I know I've got this, I know I'm strong, I know I'm a fighter so before you feel compelled to give me a ""generic "" cancer patient responses save yourself the energy and time. Life is truky unfair, cancer sucks and for now I can only give it my all and be saddened that this is my journey. However, I thank the Lord for choosing me instead of our children or my family or friends, my loves. I'll take the Bullet as long as they all live happy healthy lives.I hope I covered it all but you can ask any questions if I didn't :) ♡♡♡.""Any support provided will go to medical bills and traveling costs for treatments in Boston.",124ae6c196fd48fa66c9d9d0b23a670e,42,0.0485,16.0,0,1,mixed,0,1,2,1,1,0.001288659793814433,0.002577319587628866,0.45298488342300797,1.2225606657843358,2.0,gofundme

The Squamous cell cancer (skin cancer) was found in his nose.  After several rounds of radiation and minor procedures the cancer tirelessly continued to spread throughout lymph nodes and areas of his face, attacking bone and tissue.  On February 23, 2018 they removed most of his nose, pallet of his mouth, and his top lip.  One week later, they went in a took more after finding out that they did not get all the cancer the first time.  After these procedures and many days in the hospital, Ronnie then went under reconstructive surgery on March 16, 2018.  The recovery was expected to be 7-10 days.  With a hopeful heart, Ronnie was counting down the days until he was able to finally go home fully reconstructed.  That one surgery quickly turned into 6!  He had multiple bone and skin grafts fail resulting in all the reconstruction being removed over and over again.  In addition to all the physical strain that they surgery was already putting his body through, he had 2 arteries rupture in his neck rupture as well.  There are too many complications to really list, as we lost count during those days.  Ronnie continued to fight for himself and his family.  He was released on April 9, 2018, with a partial reconstruction of his face and on a feeding tube.  Since just before his initial surgery, Ronnie has not been able to work in his rehabilitation home business.  Throughout the years Ronnie and Cyndi have served in so many ways giving to every person they come across.  We are in high hopes and a heavy heart that our friends and family will give back to them.  They are in severe financial stress all while still dealing with Ronnie’s illness and restraints.  They are being forced from their home because they are unable to pay the rent and bills at this time.

I am setting up this account on behalf of my mother, ""Brenda Jeddry Doucette"", who we recently found out has stage 2 skin cancer. There are three tumors right next to her bladder, (yup,skin cancer..on the inside! I had no clue that was even possible.), the biggest tumor is actually pressing up against her bladder making it impossible for her to pee on her own. The tumors can not be operated on. They must be battled with a combination of radiation & chemotherapy treatments at the cancer center in Halifax, which is 300 klms or so away from our home in Yarmouth. We were told that she is expected to need 7 or more weeks of treatments, depending of course on how well things go. The thing that breaks my heart & bothers me the most  , (other than the fact she has to endure & go through any of this ),..is that she'll have to do it alone . I am her only child,and as much as I want to be by her side through all of it,...I have a full time job & family of my own to also take care of. I'am currently looking into things to see if there's any way I might be able to be with her through some of this at least., but right now I simply do not have the financial means to be by her side the way I want to be. I know & am greatful that there will be support groups, help & I'm sure she'll meet new people,.., but there's no substitute for family, especially once the side effects of treatment start to happen.  We are currently waiting for an MRI to make sure the known tumors are all we're dealing with, and hoping to start treatments by the end of January at the latest. Unfortunately due to the complications the tumors are causing, she has been unable to work since November & has already used up a lot of her sick time with unemployment insurance. I am reaching out to all of you in hopes of raising enough for her to live on throughout her treatments & the recovery time she'll need.,Maybe even so that I can be with her during her hardest week, unless I find another way to do so between now & then.  If you've ever met my mother, you know that she's a great person. She's a great mom & a wonderful grandmother. She's hard working,friendly & very kind. She's worked hard her whole life, doesn't have much to show for it, but is greatful for what she does have,& is always quick to help others in need any way she can.  It's not easy asking for help,..Thank you for even taking the time to read this,..we greatly appreciate any donations and prayers that you can give,..Even if sharing this page is all you can afford to do...Thanks so much !",fa48a27bac76ea19a7676b9c87679583,20,0.500625,780.0,4,0,skin cancer,0,1,0,1,0,0.0019267822736030828,0.0,0.19060250094732853,3.690620254023576,0.0,gofundme

He got everyone into snowboarding in the late 90's and ever since it's been an amazing adventure and whats turned out to be careers for all of us, having followed Abe's lead. Abe retired from professional snowbaording years ago and started a family with his beautiful wife Gina. They are the proud parents of 2 awesome young boys who adore their dad. Unfortunately Abe's had a rough go of things lately. He's developed an aggressive form of Basil Cell Carcinoma, a skin cancer that has started on the left side of his face, in and around his left eye. Doctors attempted to surgically remove the growth twice, but, as things go, they didn't get it all, and deformed his eye in the process. The cancer has come back more aggressive than ever and has started to spread over his body. Luckily there are some doctors who still believe it to be treatable and Abe has committed to a treatment program in Vermont. He's focusing on the Gerson program, with the assistance of some specialists as well as our mom Pat Teter, who's an Oncology (cancer) and emergency room nurse, at Springfield Hospital in Vermont.  He's in great hands for this long process.  Abe is determined to beat this, and not to lose his eye or potentially his life. He has a long road ahead of him to become healthy, and go back to being the full time father of his boys, whom he loves dearly and are living in Tahoe with their Mom..  Abe does not have insurance that will cover the expensive treatment. His medical bills have started to mount, as well as the bills to pay the mortgage on his family's house, while he is in treatment. We humbly ask for any support you might be able to give and to share this campaign on your social media, should you see fit.  All funds wil go toward Abe's medical treatment fund and related costs.

Today, Donald has hope.  Learn more about Donald's Cancer Journey at:  www.DonaldsCancerJourney.org Donald was born in Mutare, Zimbabwe on the 22nd of December, 2002.  He began to develop normally until it became clear that something was wrong.In June, 2006, when Donald was only 3 years old, his Father passed. Tragically, Donald also lost his Mother two months later; he became a double-orphan.Donald’s Grandmother cared for him for the next ten years, but by the time Donald was 13, she, at 87, could no longer cope with Donald’s challenges.  By March, Donald could still walk without assistance, however his overall condition continued to decline. Already partially blind, cancer continued to riddle his face, head and tongue; Donald could no longer attend school and was forced to drop out.In February, 2017, Donald’s family took Donald’s story to the media in hopes that the public may assist. You can read the original ZBC story below: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Spare a thought for cancer patients He has never enjoyed childhood as he was in and out of hospital beginning at the age of three and now at 14 years Donald Dziruni who suffers from a condition called ‘Xerodema Pigmentosa’ is a school dropout as the condition is worsening with each new day.Xeroderma Pigmentosa is a rare condition passed down through families in which the skin and tissue covering the eye are extremely sensitive to ultraviolet light.The condition of pigmentosa has become a thorn in the flesh for Donald having lived with the condition for 14 years.The condition which was diagnosed at the age of three has now worsened and as a result he is now partially blind.The pigmentosa disease has become full blown deforming his face and head.The disease has begun slowly to destroy his lips and despite five separate operations which were carried out to try and manage the condition, he is getting worse day by day.Worse still, Donald is being looked after by his aunt who is blind and all her savings have ran out.Mrs Helen Dziruni, the aunt, is pinning her hopes on the intervention of well wishers.Like any other child, Donald still believes that his dream to become a nurse or an engineer can be realised, but that wish can only be fulfilled once he gets medical assistance.His uncle Mr Kenneth Dziruni together with other family members have tried to get help from local health institutions and even churches but to no avail.The family is now appealing for financial assistance as the hospital bills have become too heavy.For the past 14 years his desire to live a healthy life has just but become a pipe dream.It has been pain and more pain for him day and night. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vice President Mphoko and the Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC) learned of Donald’s struggle and formed a special team to address the situation.  Health experts, researchers and specialists from around the world were consulted; within weeks, an approved support plan and observational study commenced with the consent of Donald’s family.In March, 2017, Donald’s traditional treatment protocol began at Chitungwiza Central Hospital near Harare, Zimbabwe. The effort, overseen by Specialists, Traditional Medical Practitioners, Ministry of Health and OPC officials was successful. Donald was admitted at 23 kg. He suffered from severe multiple cancerous open malignant tumours and sores on his lips, face, head and tongue. Within the first 30 days, not only had his weight doubled; his skin, mouth, vision and overall condition remarkably improved.Supervising CCH Internal Specialist, Dr. W. Nyamayaro outlined Donald’s “overwhelmingly encouraging” progress in an update report requested in April, by the OPC: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------RE: DONALD DZIRUNI: XENODERMA PIGMENTATIONBackground InformationXenoderma pigmentation is a rare disorder transmitted in an autosome recessive manner. It is characterized by skin that is extremely sensitive to light (photosensitive skin) with pigment changes and showing tendering to premature aging and malignant tumor development. The defect is in the DNA damaged by UV radiation. No curative medicine exist but management include adequate solar protection by use of sunblocking creams and clothing. The disease carries a poor prognosis with less than 40% of the affected burning beyond 20 years and mean age of skin cancer is 8 years.Donald was admitted from Parirenyatwa Hospital after having developed a malignant tumor on his lower lip. Most convention treatment modalities had not yielded much positive results. Now he has been started on traditional cannabinoid therapy under the guidance of Jason Bowman which includes the use of some herbal creams, drinks, sprays and special diet amongst other things.The progress made so far within a month of commencement of the medication is overwhelmingly encouraging. There is early evidence of the tumor shrinking and also an improvement in the state of the skin as a whole.We hope the young boy’s condition continues to improve and hope to fully achieve the intended goal which is to cure the patient.Kind regardsDr W. Nyamayaro  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Donald was discharged from CCH hospital in August, 2017 by V.P. Mphoko, the Health Minister, and CCH C.E.O., Dr. Moyo; he returned to Mutare and continued treatment from home.In November, 2017 sudden changes in government overturned the OPC project respecting Donald. His treatment became at risk. Today, left without access to his diet and medicine, Donald’s vision and skin continue to deteriorate once again.Today, Donald and his family need your help in order to continue his treatment. Specialists and those treating him have not abandoned hope, but without funding, Donald can not continue his healing journey.We have started a trust fund for Donald in order that his treatment continue and so that we can help to fund his living expenses and education.We are thankful to those who have put our names to, committed to study, developed the protocol, and commenced Donald’s treatment.  Diligent observations and reports have been collected and published. Our main priority remains that a suitable case management plan remain in place for Donald.  We are most thankful for your show of interest and support.Thank you.Connect with us at  www.donaldscancerjourney.org for updates and detailed information. http://www.tellzim.com/2017/04/orphan-with-rare-condition-seeks-help.htmlFAQsHow you are related to Donald?

Jason Bowman was introduced to Kenneth (Donald's Uncle and Legal Guardian) and Donald in Zimbabwe last March by the former Vice President, Mphoko and the Minister of Health. I have been acting as agent and Donald's fundraising co-ordinator for the family since Kenneth signed consent for me to lead a team to care for him. I act as a volunteer, and do not accept personal payment for any work done for Donald or his family.

Who can withdraw funds?

Unfortunately, Kenneth (Donald's caregiver) can not access funds raised for him from within Zimbabwe.  Severe cash shortages and strict Bank withdrawel limits make caring for Donald extra challenging.  Jason Bowman can withdraw funds in Canada in order to pay some expenses for Donald and his family from his Paypal and online Tangerine Bank accounts. How do you deliver the funds to Donald and his family? 

When U.S. Cash is required on the ground in Zimbabwe, by Donald's family, it is easily transferred via Western Union.  This way, Kenneth can retrieve U.S. cash at locations in Zimbabwe without lineups or excessive withdrawal limits.  There is a small fee, we try to pay as many expenses from Canada as possible. 

What are the funds raised used for?

Currently:

Many foods, and items Donald urgently requires can not be purchased in Zimbabwe.  We need to send send cash via Western Union to Kenneth for travel and food expenses.  Near-term:Donald will need a passport and visa to leave Zimbabwe for treatment. He will also require airfare and living expenses once relocated.Long Term:

Debido a su condición, este año no ha podido trabajar mucho y ya se han agotado sus recursos tras 8 meses de tratamientos médicos. Con su ayuda podemos regalarle tranquilidad, así como la esperanza de volver a caminar y trabajar como antes lo hacía. Quienes lo conocen, saben que ha sido un hombre sano, activo y fuerte. Esta enfermedad ha sido un golpe duro e inesperado para toda la familia. Esperamos que puedan donar aunque sea una pequeña cantidad para ayudar a su recuperación.  De antemano, muchísimas gracias por su generosidad. Esperamos que todo salga bien. Que Dios los bendiga. A continuación pueden leer su historia y ver las fotos del proceso hasta la fecha.¿Cómo empezó esto? Hace algunos años tuvo un carcinoma  de células basales (cáncer de piel) en la parte superior de su pantorrilla derecha, a pocos centímetros de la rodilla. Empezó como una pequeña herida que no cicatrizaba. Pasó consulta y lo diagnosticaron equivocadamente como úlcera varicosa y recibió tratamiento, lógicamente, sin éxito.Años más tarde, finalmente fue remitido a un oncólogo. Las opciones eran: cirugía o radiación. Eligió radiación porque le garantizaba que el cáncer desaparecería. Lo que no se imaginó es que como consecuencia, a los meses, se abriría una cavidad que dejaba visto el hueso.El hueso expuesto a la radiación murió, es decir, dejó de recibir irrigación sanguínea y se volvió vulnerable a las bacterias. Contrajo una infección de e. coli y se le hizo la primera cirugía de curetaje para limpiar el hueso y eliminar la infección, en febrero de 2018. Una vez libre de infección, a finales de abril de 2018, se le realizó una cirugía para utilizar uno de los músculos de la pantorrilla para cerrar el hueco en su pierna, esto es lo que llaman un colgajo. Sobre el colgajo se colocó un injerto de su propia piel. Lamentablemente, adquirió en el hospital la terrible bacteria llamada Pseudomona Aeruginosa. Y desde entonces ha estado luchando contra la infección, pasando por todo tipo de antibióticos, en pastilla, inyectados, intravenosos, que además de ser super potentes, son caros. A finales de agosto de 2018, justo cuando el colgajo ya está pegando y el injerto de piel ha logrado conectar con la piel de la pierna, encontraron tejido necrosado (muerto) en un costado. Al retirar lo que parecía ser una costra superficial, el cirujano encontró que se trataba de una fístula que provenía del hueso, poniendo en riesgo no solo el colgajo sino otros huesos sanos. Nuevamente la Pseudomona Aeruginosa está tratando de hacer estragos. Esto pone en peligro todos los avances e incluso la posibilidad de caminar. Pronto será sometido a una nueva cirugía de curetaje para limpiar esta infección y posteriormente le espera un largo camino de antibióticos y varias cirugías para reparar el daño causado por la bacteria..............................Siempre sano En su juventud, José Antonio fue un atleta exitoso, ganando campeonatos regionales de levantamiento de pesas. Reconocido por ser un hombre inteligente, trabajador y fuerte,  desde hace 8 meses no puede caminar y falta mucho tiempo para que lo haga. Esto le ha impedido trabajar con normalidad y además, ha afectado su estado anímico. Hasta esta enfermedad, nunca había padecido de nada. .............................................................................................Help José Antonio walk againWe are raising funds to help José Antonio pay for medical bills. Due to his health condition, he has been unable to work regularly for the past 8 months and has run out of money.What happened?A few years ago he developed Basal Cell Carcinoma on his right calf. He was misdiagnosed and wasted valuable time before being referred to an oncologist. Finally, he received radiation therapy and the skin cancer was destroyed. However, within months, the radiated area on his leg collapsed, leaving his bone exposed. He got a bacterial infection: e. coli and had a surgery to remove the infection. He began the first course of antibiotics.A couple of months later, he had another surgery to fill in the cavity on his leg with one of his lower leg muscles. Unfortunately, he caught a very resistant bacteria at the hospital: Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. For four months now, this bacteria has delayed the recovery process and now has infected the bone causing chronic osteomyelitis. He will have another surgery soon to remove this infection from the bone, but he’ll require at least two to four more surgeries to strengthen or replace the bone so that he may keep his leg and walk again. He has been on all sorts of antibiotics since February. The bacterium has become resistant to most medications. Amputation has been considered but only as last resort, as the leg is still functional and both the muscle and skin graft have healed. With your contribution, we can help him regain peace of mind, hope and help him to -literally- get back on his feet. He was always been a healthy, active and strong man, so these health issues have come as a surprise to all of us. We would love for him to recover completely without falling into further debt.Thank you in advance for your generosity. We hope that everything will turn out well.

He is a father of two beautiful and amazing children. He is a husband to a loving and supportive wife. He is a son to a remarkable Mom and Dad. He is a little brother who still looks up to his big bro. He is the best friend a person could possibly ever hope for. He is an uncle, a cousin, a brother-in-law, a coach, a teammate, a neighbor and a co-worker. He is also a cancer survivor!Sadly, cancer does not care about all of the things Brad represents to us. He and his family are faced again with uncertainties that go hand in hand with someone who has been diagnosed with cancer.With your generous help and support, we can all pitch in to help shoulder this burden and lighten the load for Brad and his family. Together we will win!Brad’s Story:In 2013 Brad was diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer. As you might imagine, it was a terrible surprise for Brad, his family, and his friends. True to his nature, Brad immediately set to work on the treatment and healing process and in 2014 was pronounced by his doctor to be in remission. Since 2014, Brad has been getting scans and checkups regularly to look for any signs of a recurrence of the cancer. The scan at the beginning of 2016 detected a small spot on his lung. At the time, the spot was very small, in fact too small for his doctor to determine if it was cancer or not. The doctor continued to monitor the spot very closely to track its growth and development.  As the scans continued, it was revealed that additional spots were now appearing. It was still too early to tell if these spots were cancerous or something else altogether. All they could do was wait until one of the spots grew big enough to biopsy.Finally, in April of this year, the scan revealed that the largest spot was now a viable candidate for a biopsy. Brad went in for biopsy surgery, then anxiously waited for the results. He has said many times that one of the most difficult parts of this process is the waiting, especially this time.  The results eventually came and it was not the news everyone was hoping for. His cancer was back and had spread to his lungs. Because the melanoma had spread beyond the original area of skin and nearby lymph nodes to other organs, this classified Brad as having stage 4 melanoma.Now that it was confirmed that the cancer was back and in his lungs, the doctors ordered an extensive MRI of his entire body. What they discovered was, that in addition to his lungs, he now had a spot near his kidney as well as one on his brain. This news was a game changer.  With the stakes being raised, it was time for a second opinion. Brad and Steph traveled to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. While staying overnight in a hotel, they waited anxiously to meet with a team of specialists to review his case. The meeting went well and was very informative. Best of all, the doctors were cautiously optimistic. They presented Brad with options for treatment, which have been successful in similar cases. He and his family will now need to weigh these options, and balance them with what is best. No matter which road leads to Brad’s healing, he and his family need our support. Please consider donating as they will be impacted by extensive medical bills, medications and lost wages. In addition to financial support, Brad and Steph need you. They need you to reach out to them by phone, email or a visit.

On October 13th my sister was told she had a brain tumor, called Oligodendroglioma, and the next day she was in surgery to remove it. Surgery went well, and they were able to remove all of the tumor. However, in the brain they are not able to take wider margins like they would be able to if it was skin cancer. While following up with her hematologist, he informed her that she would indeed need chemo and radiation to disrupt the regrowth of cells left behind.  So, the week of Thanksgiving, she will be starting 5 1/2 weeks of radiation along with chemo for 1 year.Why did I start this Go Fund Me? Stephanie has worked incredibly hard to get her life on the right path. This year has been especially difficult for her. From finding out that she has a genetic blood clotting disorder, which caused her to get a blood clot after surgery in February to now having a brain tumor. She takes each thing that the universe throws at her and focuses on the next steps to take without becoming negative and feeling helpless and full of pity.For all my life, my sister has been my biggest tormentor and hugest supporter. It was her words and love that made me turn from drugs and enter rehab 13 years ago. She supported me 100% during my yearlong rehab program and her love changed my life. Now it’s my turn to do everything I can to support her during this 12-month life altering challenge. I can offer her love, emotional support, a shoulder to cry on and arms to hug and hold her up but I lack the ability to support her in another important way. A way that will ease her burdens and stress. Financial.For all her career, Stephanie has worked with children. It’s her calling in life. She loves all children but especially has a heart for special needs children. She has worked with Down syndrome children, ill-mannered children, children with Autism and children without handicaps. Stephanie has left her imprint on each child that she has worked with. That is evidenced by all of the references and the love and support of all of the families she has worked with.Over the past several years, Stephanie has been working independently with her families, which means that she does not qualify for State Disability to help her pay her bills. She has been told that she won’t be able to work for the next 12 months while she is going through treatment. If I can get 700 people to donate $25.00 (or more if you can ), she will be set until she can find a new position. Will you please help me support my sister and pass along this request to your friends too? If you will do that, we can all make life easier on Stephanie. I thank God for you and all of your support. With love and gratitude,Jon Keller",7b747ee23ad37479720b9b045656c210,28,0.21605555555555556,90.0,3,1,skin cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

Since that visit his neck tumor grew in size in just a few days.  I took him to the Dix Hwy animal hospital today 6-3 and they scheduled him for surgery tomorrow morning.  I just left him there today and my heart was breaking as I walked out the door.  They loosely quoted me $1200 for just the first surgery and needed $500 down just to keep him.  My baby boy goes in for surgery tomorrow and I am just a wreck.  You can see in the photos how big these suckers are and it’s scaring me to death.  He is such a gentle soul with unconditional love pouring out of him.  I am estimating the costs of the additional surgeries based on how much the first one will set me back.  I have already emptied my bank account and will sell everything I own for Lucas, he has been such an amazing companion and I could never fully explain how much he has done to get me through tough times in life.  I would never ask for anything for myself but Lucas is another story, I’ll swallow my pride for him any day.  I’m not giving up without a fight.  If you are able to help it would mean the world to me and Lucas.   Thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to read this.  If you have any questions, please don’t hesistate to ask.  Much love ❤️  John KempainenUpdate!He has been home for 12 days and was initially on Trazodone and Tramadol HCL for pain and sedation to keep him from getting at his stitches. When I got the results back from the biopsy confirming Epitheliotropic Lymphoma (a type of aggressive skin cancer) I felt hopeless. The doc suggested chemo and bone marrow testing, now I’m completely hysterical. I said he’s 11 1/2 and I’m NOT putting him through chemo. The doc then said they could continue to sell me pain pills until he dies! It made me SO angry! This is not the kind of time I want to be spending with my best friend. My close friend and amazing woman Lori, who is battling her own health demons has had amazing success with RSO (rick Simpson oil). If you are unfamiliar, look it up, I was astonished by the testimonials and results and also was willing to try anything for my big boy. I am trying to reach my goal now to obtain as much CLEAN RSO as possible to aggressively treat and hopefully kill Luke’s skin cancer. Rick Simpson even used the oil to treat his own skin cancer! I’ve got a bit and it is working WONDERS for his pain management, appetite and general well being. I have him on .03g three times a day, so only just barley under a tenth of a gram a day!  He is even running in the yard and trying to play with me! THIS is the kind of time I want to spend with my Louie!

Life has been a struggle for their family going all the way to 2009. On Mother's Day 2009, Zach was only 9 years old, and diagnosed with PNET (Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor) Brain Cancer. They began an intensive 7 weeks of chemotherapy and radiation immediately. He would be given treatments Monday-Friday. They then gave him a month break from it all, and then began another 3-4 months of very intensive Chemotherapy. At some point after that Zach did go into remission, and they thought they were in the clear. Due to the treatments Zach now has permanent brain damage, memory loss, loss of hearing, lung disease and he's losing his vision. He's only 15 years old. About a year ago, it was discovered that Gorlin Syndrome was not only found in Zach, but in Miranda and Gavin as well. Gorlin syndrome, also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, is a condition that affects many areas of the body and increases the risk of developing various cancerous and noncancerous tumors. There is more information if you click on the link: ( http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/gorlin-syndrome) Due to having this disease as well, they have found 2 new spots on his brain that they are closely monitoring, and he has skin cancer that covers his body. They tried the chemo cream that is used for skin cancer, but due to all of the chemo his body has already been through, his body rejected the treatments, and it's not helping. There is no way to get rid of them all. He now goes to the Dermatologist every 3 months to have 2-3 of them surgically removed at a time, which is very painful. This is going to be a continuing lifetime battle with never ending pain when he has them removed. Something that both Gavin and Miranda have to worry about as well. Doctors have told Miranda that Zach will live with her the rest of his life. No one knows what the future holds for this family. They just cannot seem to catch a break.Zach will be 16 years old on December 31st, 2015. When turning 16 all of us look forward to driving, ""gaining our freedom"", and being able to be a 16 year old. This is something Zach will never get to do. Because of all of the complications from his chemotherapy treatments, he will NEVER drive. He will never get to be a normal 16 year old boy. Miranda as I said is a single Mom, and works as hard as she can to make sure her boys have everything they need. But with so much on their plates, they often struggle financially. With the boys' medical issues, if they are sick Miranda has to drive from Janesville to Madison to the American Family Children's Hospital, often missing work to do so. A place they have called ""their second home"" due to being there so often. Miranda NEVER asks for help, she always says, ""I HATE asking for help and would rather struggle to make things work. I know there is ALWAYS someone worse off than we are. I am just thankful to have such amazing friends and family. We are blessed in that way for sure!"" With Christmas right around the corner, and Zach's 16th birthday right after that, a milestone they didn't know if Zach would ever get to, let's help! Let's help make the financial struggles a little easier for this amazing family, and maybe help them celebrate Zach's birthday together as a family making memories! Every little bit helps!

She is fighting cancer and needs help covering treatment expenses.(Dianna Solatorio with her family in Halawa Valley, Molokai)You may know Dianna Solatorio from the PBS documentary ""Sons of Halawa"". Dianna has an amazing story of meeting a young Hawaiian named Pilipo Solatorio when she was just 16 years old in California. They became pen pals and best friends and when Dianna turned 18, Pilipo proposed to her. They have been married for over 50 years now and have raised 6 children on the island of Molokai.

In the Summer of 2018 the cancer spread to lymph nodes in her neck. Her doctors detected it early and Dianna underwent major surgery to have the large tumor removed. She now has to undergo 6 weeks of radiation treatment on Maui.(The scar left from her recent surgery)Dianna's medical insurance leaves her with 20% copay on all her medical bills and does not cover travel costs. Dianna and Pilipo both live on fixed retirement income and the medical costs of cancer treatment has overwhelmed them financially. The surgery leaves them with a $2000 bill and the upcoming radiation treatment will cost at least another $2000. Travel, ongoing checkups, and future treatments will also add to this burden. Your donation to Dianna's GoFundMe campaign will go directly to Dianna Solatorio and will be used entirely to help pay for her medical bills and cancer treatment expenses.Mahalo!",bf6aec6157b8cb1f9f2a29d9fac9921d,17,1.043,180.0,3,1,skin cancer,1,2,0,1,0,0.006269592476489028,0.0,0.060814383923849816,2.8229106224270395,0.0,gofundme

Darrell was working away in Sydney when he went for his regular 6 monthly skin check. He had been seeing an Adelaide specialist who had not picked up the changes in the nose or followed up to ensure the appropriate scans were done. Darrell is a high risk, with both his sister and father dying from cancer; and Darrell himself having a history of skin cancer and previous operations for treatment.Fortunately, the skin specialist in Sydney picked up that things weren’t right and did a biopsy and then sent Darrell for a PET can and MRI – which came back showing that Darrell had cancer and needed urgent surgery. The team were amazing, and he was booked in quickly to have the lump removed on 5 April 2018.Unfortunately, that is not where the story ends. The Surgeon had to take the lump and part of the nose as the cancer was more extensive. Post-surgery the pathology came back and read that he has “highly infiltrative aggressive carcinoma”. Darrell requires a rhinectomy – removal of the nose. Major surgery and then radiotherapy.Darrell will undergo the surgery in Sydney on 16 April. And then return to SA for radiotherapy and then once healed will be fitted with a nasal prosthesis.As small business owners in Country SA, Darrell and his wife have had to abruptly close their business and put their house on the market to survive. The surgery could not be delayed due to the aggressive nature of the carcinoma. With less than 2 weeks, and no income, the house renovations needed to be completed, all the while Darrell still not recovered from the first surgery.Time is limited to sell their house and car, as they are unable to pay their mortgage and have no lead time before Darrell undergoes surgery and will be out of action for and undergoing radiation.The couple are hoping to relocate to Adelaide where Darrell will be attending the cancer clinic.

Rare to see in Females especially under the age of 30. She under went Brain surgery, after the surgery she started having seizures because of the brain surgery. Once Kendra had healed from the Brain surgery they started radiation and then 6 months of Chemotherapy doing 1 week of chemo every 4 weeks(total of 6 weeks of chemotherapy). Kendra ended up losing almost 40 pounds over this 6 month period. After finishing Kendra had a 3 month break, went in for her first check up and they found the tumor starting to grow back already. They weren't 100% sure if it was another tumor or scar tissue. The Oncologist suggested we come back in 2 months for another MRI. We went in 2 months later, had the MRI and they gave Kendra the option of starting chemotherapy that day or waiting another 2 months for another MRI so they could be sure Kendra declined starting that day and wanted to come back in two months for another MRI. We went back 2 months later but during this 2 months span we started seeing all the original symptoms that brought us to the emergency when this all first began.  The news we got from the Doctors was not unexpected but for Kendra who's only 28 now, was devastated. They told Kendra that not only was the tumor they originally went after growing back, but she now had a spot on the other side of her brain as well. Both tumors are in inoperable spots of the brain, So best case scenario for her is that the 12 weeks of chemotherapy they want to put her through will stop them from growing. Kendra won't ever have the chance of going into remission, her tumors will always be there. Through this whole time she has been unable to work, I Braden Yakubow have done my best to take care of her. With the loss of her income we began to fall behind on bills, at the beginning of this year we had to take out a loan from my grandparents just so that we could pay the credit card down leaving room on the card to continue paying our bills. Now that this year has gone by the credit card is racked up again, and with the new diagnosis her chances of ever being able to travel somewhere have slowly began to disappear. Kendra came from a single parent home her father having passed away when she was around the age of 12, her mother getting melanoma skin cancer when she was around 15 and surviving through it, but all the while having to play parent for her younger brother and sister dropping out of high school so that she could help her mom pay the bills in the house. Now going through her own life threatening battle I want Kendra to be able to experience some of the wonders the world has to offer before her chances are gone forever. The money I want to raise is for***********************************************************1)*Most important *

Kendra's BucketlistA)Disney World(she's a huge disney fan but never been to a Disney resort of any kind)B)JamaicaC)Cayman Islands(she wants to see the reefs before theyre gone forever)D)Train Trip across Canada from the West coast to the East coast(then tour the east coast e.i. Quebec, Newfoundland, Novascotia, PEI)2) Get a reliable vehicle that we can depend on for getting her to and from treatment and just day to day living.***********************************************************

The situation is grave, The timeline is unsure. It all depends on how her chemotherapy goes. With how hard the first treatment was, I can only imagine that this second go around it has a good chance of doing just as much damage as the cancer itself.

If the tumors don't stop growing she'll begin to feel loss of concentration, start to have vision issues, loss of motivation. Eventually attacking parts of the brain that would control her emotions, her memories and her ability to walk, talk, even sit. Kendra doesn't want to be a vegetable, she wants to live her life to the fullest as long as she can not missing out on anything the world has to offer. I met her 5 years ago and just getting to know someone like her will change your perspective on people. Kendra is someone who has purest intentions and a heart the size of North America. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this.I hope this compelled you to help us, if not thank you anyways and we appreciate the messages of support!",233d951b4458e004f83c790d55a3fc49,30,0.1007,450.0,2,0,mixed,0,1,0,1,0,0.0012315270935960591,0.0,0.6067135404853709,1.2225606657843358,0.0,gofundme

His first fight was against stomach cancer. I remember thinking to myself, wow you would never even know he is fighting against something so scary. His symptoms and side effects were little to none. He beat it and life went on. I didn’t worry, I didn’t even dwell on it. It was that easy. As the years went by he continued to enjoy life without even a mention of that small hiccup named cancer. About 8 years after his amazing first win against Malt Lymphoma, he entered the ring once again. This time, the same Malt Lymphoma had spread to his lungs. He was calm and collected. His faith and strength remained the same as always. He took on this battle and came out with another WIN! His winning statement remains the same “ God is faithful”. Last summer, not too long after beating lung cancer; he was once again set back with another challenge. This time it was skin cancer. A slow growing type, called basal cell carcinoma. Again, his faith in God did not waver. When I heard the news that he was going to have half of his nose removed, and start radiation; I was scared. I didn’t want his face to change. I didn’t want to watch him fight. Unfortunately, we didn’t have a choice. After his surgery and 32 treatments of radiation we thought the fight was over. Cancer on the other hand had a different idea. This May, my dad was told he now had squamous cell carcinoma. Here goes another fight! After years of observing cancer, I always saw cancer as silent and hidden. Today, I now see cancer front and center. I watched each week as my father’s face was rapidly being eaten away by cancer, something nobody should ever have to watch. As more tumors grew, his features and skin deteriorated away. This all was happening so fast. My father is one of the most loving and strong men I know. As strong as he remained, he couldn’t do this alone. This time it was a tag-team effort. My oldest brother Malachi, stepped in the ring with our dad. He was well conditioned and ready to take on anything in the way. The oncologist and ENT specialist were not prepared for this type of fight. Because each week was crucial and the window of opportunity for treatment was closing, we had to act fast. With the right team and support, I’ve learned nothing is impossible! Our team was unstoppable! In my dad’s corner, he had; his wife, children, extended family, and friends. In the same week while his local doctors were scratching their heads at a stand-still, my brother Malachi worked hard with the help of some others and got The University of Michigan Hospital to take on this challenge.After several appointments, as the surgeons studied my father’s face and body, they came up with the plan of attack. We received his surgery date! Yes, surgery. Not just any surgery--This was one of the biggest, scariest, surgeries my family has ever encountered. My dad was having the entire left side of his face removed. As the surgeons, nurses, and other specialist prepared us all for what was going to take place, we also prepared ourselves mentally. My family has always been close, and as we prepared we became even closer. So many people asked, “how do you even prepare for something like this”? My answer; you prepare with prayer, love, and comfort. This fight is really no different than any other day. It’s important to take the time to love and stay true to your faith. Tomorrow is never promised, and with that we prayed for the strength to take one day at a time.Today, just 4 weeks after my father’s surgery, we were told that his cancer still remains in 5 different areas throughout his face. Two places that absolutely knock the wind out of my chest; his brainstem, and his bone. Even though this news is just part of the fight, as I sit here today typing this I have a lump in my throat. It’s hard to swallow this one.As my dad enters his final round, against this horrible cancer; I’m reaching out for help.For the next 6 weeks, my step-mother will be driving my dad a total of 2 hours a day. He will receive radiation 5 days a week, and chemo 1 day a week. My step- mother, Kristen has not worked in months as my dad needs constant care. My brothers and I have continued to help in all ways possible. At this time, even the smallest donation will help tremendously! Your donation will go towards all travel expenses, as well as the constant medical bills and day to day bills. Please from the bottom of my heart, know that we are so thankful for all the prayers, kind words, and any contribution.Thank you from our entire family!",f7328a842d6b7ed02cae93bb5b4903bf,62,0.5703333333333334,570.0,5,1,mixed,0,15,0,8,0,0.017523364485981307,0.0,0.0034873583260680036,27.535152921248088,0.0,gofundme

When I was 8 I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis and of course had rare complications with my heart. Early on my Dad told me how life wasn't fair and you just had to do your best and keep trying and so I do. I like to say I'm like the Little red hen from the story that learned to do things for herself.  I continue having medical issues today. After I graduated high school I married my ""high school sweetheart"" and 38 years later are still together through it all.  I had two beautiful kids both with challenges as well.  After my daughter was born i was unable to work again .After my son was born I became a full time electric wheelchair user.  I adapted and do it all. I learned to clean the shower with a mop. I kept my kids in over-all so I could grab them off the ground when they didn't want to leave from the park. That is why my Niece calls me Wonder Woman, she ""wonders how I do it all.""My father was diagnosed with myotonic dystrophy.My Mother also had health issues requiring open heart surgery. Between taking the kids to extra speech classes, helping my parents, helping my Sister with Cervical Palsy my life was busy and i had my own obstacles, surgeries and falling and breaking both legs at once ect... In 1999, life was great.We were able to buy a house that was perfect, no steps for my chair, wider doors, and a roll in shower.  My parents even bought a house next door set-up for my Dad also now wheelchair confind. My husband had plans to commute for a few years to max out his retirement and go into trucking for another 20 years.  However, my Son started having more problems with medical issues.  Guess life was getting to good with the new house and such.  Two years after the move, I found my life back to its normal craziness with my Father at one end of the hospital dying and my Husband at the other having a kidney removed from cancer. My Father did pass and my Husband's challenges just started. He kept me busy with a major infection, abdominal hernias, and treatments for bladder cancer.  Somewhere in the middle my Daughter started having unknown medical problems. With my Husbands next surgery, he started having eye problems which in time his left him legally blind.  End of the dream, no second job only disability income.Thing started to calm again. This time my Sister, got herself in trouble and got kicked out of her apartment. So she lived with us until I was able to get things fixed. She got her own place but I was still her all around support who got the calls during the night when her wheelchair  broke or her aid was sick. There are a lot of episodes left out, just too much to mention. Sometimes it feels like I am cursed or something but then I think of my family and know I am actually blessed.During this all, I talk to students at the local High Schools ""day of respect"" and try to instill respect for the disabled population and pass on the I can do it attitude I have acquired.  I also run our Neighborhood Watch.In the past, it always seems my guardian angel has always been able to help me. I cut coupons, shop sales, add a little more water to the soup and somehow a refund shows up in just time. However, I finally find myself at an impasse.  My van has a lot of miles on it and a lot of mechanical issues. My Daughter has a medical condition we are working with Stanford for and requires me to drive her back and forth to work, 30 miles each way and 90 plus miles to Stanford about once  a month, plus taking care of everyone else. I need a new wheelchair accessible van.Second, I just found out that Medicare changed rules for wheelchairs and now I don't qualify for a custom wheelchair that allows me to do the things I currently do. I need a chair  that is narrow and lower than average.  I need to be able to reach the ground without sitting at edge of my chair so I can mop the floor using my feet.  If  I get the wheelchair Medicare covers, I will be stuck being dependant for most things.  Lastly, I want to pass on a game I learned to play when I was a kid in the hospital. I smile at people who are looking in need of a better day. Yes, smiles are contagious.  They change the mood of the person receiving it and the person doing it.

We are very lucky to have a GoFundMe team member who lives close to Shari who has been helping her coordinate everything, and who has driven her to go grocery shopping, apply for assistance, and get veterinary care for her dogs - particularly her elderly dog, BangBang, who is incontinent due to a presumptive diagnosis of bladder cancer.  Shari cannot afford to pay for an ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis, but since BangBang is 16, she would not seek treatment anyway.  Her hope is that when his time comes to transition, she will be able to pay for euthanasia and cremation.  In the meantime, he is wearing male wraps, and if you'd like to directly send her some supplies, please contact me privately for address information.  I can be reached via private message on Facebook or by email at suzanneMcannon@gmail.com. I will be contacting her vet to find out if anyone can make donations directly to them for follow-up care for BangBang or her two other dogs, Jack and Spike.   If you would like contact information for Shari's veterinarian I am also happy to provide that if you contact me privately.  OK everyone, lets do this!  Again, ANY AMOUNT will help.  If you only have $5 to give, please do so!  Imagine how easy it would be to help if everyone who read this donated only $5!  Together we can continue to build a bridge of kindness.  I hope you will join us! ORIGINAL REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IS BELOW:Please answer this call for help from Shari. Widowed TWICE, she and her 3 dogs - one who is elderly and in need of veterinary care - are being evicted from their home in Western NY. She is looking for someone to foster the dogs; she hasn’t asked for money. But I cannot sit silently by and watch someone suffer in so much pain, and be abandoned or ignored.  Even the smallest acts of kindness can gather into a powerful wave of healing and transformation. We are all in this together. Money can be a temporary bridge to help this woman get back on her feet. And if you can help her dogs - so she doesn’t have to lose them - please consider doing so.

He didn’t talk ill of others and always seemed to find the good in people.  He had a special way of telling you the honest truth when it was needed.  If you were whining, he would tell you to quit your sniveling and fix it and move on.  If you were screwing up, he would tell you to quit being a dumbass and get straight and do the right thing.  But somehow he did it in a manner that gave you the confidence to do exactly that.  And afterword he would encourage and support you as you struggled to do the right thing to make your own situation better.My incredible wife and I have enjoyed a very special friendship with Chuck and Lisa over the years.  Not only did we share in the fun stuff like playing in bands, teaching music, sharing dinner and drinks and partying to live rock and roll, but we also shared in the heavy stuff.  If one of us was facing a scary medical procedure, got a disturbing diagnosis or had to face one of life’s many struggles or unpleasantries, it was the four of us standing together and helping each other through it.  No judgment, no condescension, no annoyance, just someone there standing strong with you through the hardest moments in your life.  For that I will be forever grateful and indebted.I know Chuck didn’t live an easy life and he worked hard for what he had.  But I also believe he worked hard to make life better for those who shared their lives with him, whether he realized it or not.  May we all strive to pay forward the gifts that Chuck bestowed upon us, to those who are in our own lives, in our own way.  The non-judgmental kindness, honesty and encouragement we share with the people in our lives when they are at their lowest and most vulnerable is much more powerful than any monetary or physical gift could ever be.  In my eyes, that was Chucks super power.The main thing Chuck taught us is “All that matters is LOVE”.  He professed that we were put on this earth, not to be better than others or to have more things than others, but to learn to LOVE one another.  When it comes down to it, nothing else in this world really matters.Rest in peace Chuck.  Your presence and influence in our lives will be greatly missed.  May each and every one of us carry you in our hearts and souls for the rest of our days.  Peace brother, until we meet again.Nate and Laura LearOriginal Message:Hello, my name is Laura Lear and I'm writing this ""GoFundMe Campaign"" in hopes of raising an emergency medical fund on behalf of Chuck Carns.  I write this campaign with a heavey heart as I tell you that my best friend's husband, Chuck, has been diagnosed with T-3, T-4 Stage Bladder Cancer that has migrated to his kidneys and possibly more.  After having a scope procedure, a surgery was scheduled to remove the cancer from the bladder and a stent was to be placed from the left kidney to drain.  As soon as the surgery began, the surgeon quickly realized that Chucks cancer is much larger and complex than anyone realized.I have known Lisa since the age of 7 years old.  We have  shared the most precious moments that a friendship can share.  Singing ""Dog and Butterfly"" at the top of our lungs, we skipped rope, skipped school, grew older and skipped work just to spend time together.  We have shed the tears and the smiles standing up for each other's weddings, beside each other when our children were born, and supported each other through the good and the bad all theses years. I write this campaign in hopes that we can raise funds to help Chuck and Lisa with hospital bills, medication,  and living expenses.  As Chuck is preparing for his next surgery,  I write this campaign in hopes that when he returns home he will be cancer free.  I write this campaign in hopes that all of our friends and family will help Chuck to fight this disease.  I write this campaign in hopes of giving Chuck time to recover and get well before he has to return to work.  Please help Chuck and Lisa to get through this time and pray that Chuck returns from his surgery free of this debilitating disease.",0fdc55775185f7d9e21827ce94eda972,44,0.244,930.0,1,1,bladder cancer,0,2,0,2,0,0.0019940179461615153,0.0,0.017168174266199,2.2225606657843358,0.0,gofundme

Born and raised in the Detroit/Dearborn, MI area, Cindi graduated from Edsel Ford High School with honors and received her BA from the University of Michigan. Cindi is smart, beautiful, inquisitive, hardworking, dedicated, fantastic mother and joy to be around. She started work at age 13 and eventually started Peecher’s Pizza Shoppe in Dearborn, MI with her father and brothers. Her grandmother worked at the restaurant and she enjoyed not only cooking but laughing the days away with Grandma Bruce. They successfully ran the business for over 10 years.Mark and Cindi met in Detroit, MI, where they dated for several years and in 1989 married. Both moved to Florida soon after. Cindi loved the Florida sunshine (vitamin D), the green terrain and blue sky. Once in Florida, Cindi started work with a placement company. She had various jobs during this time until she was assigned as receptionist at Nickelodeon Studios Florida. She worked her way up to Director of Human Resources. This was a very fulfilling career for Cindi. While at Nickelodeon, Cindi obtained an MBA from Rollins College.Real estate investment became Cindi’s passion once children arrived. She bought, remodeled, sold and managed several properties over the last 17 years. She enjoyed finding a fixer upper.When Cindi's father passed away due to lung cancer, she set out to find how her family can improve their chances of cancer prevention, therefore, lessening the chance of treating the disease later. She poured through all the papers, books, videos, websites, etc... and was on a constant quest for knowledge. She determined that exercise, clean/organic diet, bottled (Evian of course) or filtered water, along with minerals and vitamins are the right path to a healthy life. So, she set her family out on this path a little over 7 years ago. She has taught them well and they will continue to live as she taught.In 2014, Cindi and Mark celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary by renewing their vows at St. Giorgio Church in Castel Condino, Italy. Generations of Mark's relatives were married in this church. This was a wonderful time as her with her children, family and close friends were there to celebrate. This disease came on fast for Cindi in October 2017. What started as a cough, turned out to be stage IV lung cancer. She never smoked and took great care of herself. She fought very hard to get better and tried to comply with all doctor demands. She did it all so she could spend more time with her kids who she loved more than anything. Unfortunately, the disease caught up with her.  She will be missed but never forgotten.One never knows when it is their time so please hug your loved ones often and tell them how much you love them.In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions to GoFundMe Peecher/Bagozzi Family fund for medical expenses and children’s college.  A celebration of Cindi’s life is being planned in Michigan later next year for family and friends that cannot attend the service. Update 10/29/17It is with great sadness I share with you the evolving story of Mark and Cindi. We recently learned that Cindi has stage IV lung cancer. She has never smoked and the diagnosis has stunned our family. Previous story:Our family is in desperate need of your prayers and support this holiday. My brother Mark, 53, was recently diagnosed with stage IV prostate cancer. In May of 2016, he started having pain in his lower back and after plenty of doctor visits and tests he was told he had fractured his L2 vertebra. Unfortunately, the doctors told him nothing could be done, he just needed time to heal, but the pain got worse. In July 2016, my brother returned to the doctor for another round of tests and received his cancer diagnosis. The cancer has now metastasized to the majority of his bones causing even more pain. Mark often talks about the loss of too many family members and friends to cancer, including both our mother and father. We lost our mother to colon cancer in 1983 and our father to bladder cancer in 2006.After witnessing the grueling side effects our parents endured with traditional cancer treatments, Mark started looking for an integrated approach – one that addresses the entire body and mind - to fight the cancer rather than the standard protocol of radiation and chemo therapy. Our cousin Lisa recommended that Mark reach out to Ralph Moss, PhD – a researcher and writer on alternative medicine and cancer treatments. Following their conversation, Dr. Moss directed Mark to Dr. Ralf Kleef, a doctor specializing in integrated oncology out of Vienna, Austria. Dr. Kleef has proven, positive results with a new positive treatment called immunotherapy. With the support of his family and friends, Mark has decided to pursue Dr. Kleef’s treatment plan which will require him to travel to Vienna, Austria for 5 weeks. We all feel this is his best option in battling his cancer.More on Mark:Mark and I grew up in Dearborn, Michigan, and attended St. Alphonsus grade school and high school. After graduation, Mark attended Grand Valley State University and later moved to Orlando, Florida, where he resides with his wife Cindi and their children Mark William and Cynthia Ann. Mark is a devoted husband and father who deeply loves his family and friends. He loves to share his passion for his Italian heritage and history. He is a strong believer in God and his country. Now more than ever we need God’s strength and compassion to help Mark and his family through this difficult time.How the money will be spent:Funds raised by this campaign will go directly to Mark for his treatment. His insurance will not cover any of the cost for this type of treatment, so Mark must pay out of pocket for the treatment itself, as well as his travel. The treatment program is estimated to be $50,000. Travel and lodging for Mark is estimated at another $10,000. We hope to raise a total of $60,000 to support Mark’s treatment with Dr. Kleef in Vienna.We hope you’ll consider donating to help Mark in his treatment and recovery.

It was a normal Monday in March when Allan woke up with a lump in his neck.  Two days later was the day that changed the Pierce Family forever. Allan was diagnosed with Metastatic Bladder Carcinoma (Stage IV Bladder Cancer)  A shocking diagnosis to Allan, his wife Paula and children Nathan (19) and Courtney (16). The tumor was about 1/4 the size of his bladder and was blocking the function of his right kidney. He had three surgeries - one to scrape away as much of the tumor as they could without damaging the bladder wall, another to put in a stent to get the kidney functioning again and yet another to remove the largest lymph node and place a port for treatment.Recently given the news that the cancer has spread through the lymph nodes in his neck, under his arms, around the aorta and some muscle tissue. Sadly, Allan a loving, dedicated husband and father is engaged in the fight of his life.  He has started immunotherapy treatment and they are leaving it in God’s hands! While the prognosis may not look promising, Allan has been strong and optimistic. Their family is finding strength through their faith, family and friends and will continue to do so in the months ahead. Soon after hearing this scary prognosis Allan created a bucket list, he hopes to check off items on his bucket list, including a family trip to Hawaii. Allan would like to have the opportunity to take his family on an exciting vacation to create some lasting memories. How Can you Help?My name is Connie Steinberger and Allan is married to my lifelong friend Paula.  I was with Paula when she met Allan and I stood up in their wedding.   I am organizing an effort to fund this vacation to Hawaii for the Pierce Family.  It's an opportunity for them to spend precious time together making family memories they will cherish forever.""Sometimes the most giving spirits have to accept a helping hand""Any contributions would be used towards this vacation, and any additional funds will be put towards remaining medical expenses. Thank you for your donations, thoughts, and prayers.

He was diagnosed with Bladder Cancer in May of 2018 and they need our help with medical bills. They have insurance, but we all know that coverage is not what it used to be.  As many of you know, our best bud, classmate, friend, father, husband, brother, brother-in-law, coach, referee, co-worker and everyone's favorite, Dale Alidor, is going through some very serious health problems right now and could use our help and support.  In May of this year, Dale was diagnosed with Stage III Bladder Cancer and has been undergoing treatment ever since. He and his wife, Jenny, have been traveling from Mobile, AL to MD Anderson in Texas for treatments. There have also been countless tests and treatments performed in Mobile as well. We all know that our Health Care System is flawed and that the insurance shortfalls will hit any family very hard. Dale and Jenny are dealing with that now.   They were initially opposed to this gofundme account but the 1976 Classmates from McGill-Toolen High School have requested and suggested a platform where we could make a donation towards their mounting medical bills and travel expenses.  They were also concerned because of the recent ""alleged"" fraud ""allegedly"" committed by an ""unscrupulous"" couple. (I'm trying really hard to keep this ""PC"", y'all...).  Dale and Jenny's love story started on their first date to our Senior Prom on April 24, 1976. Actually, that's not completely correct. Dale saw ""a cute little freshman"" walk past him at Mc-T and said a quick prayer to God, asking Him to please let him be with her or someone like her. A little while later, that cute little freshman showed up at his workplace, applying for a job. Dale took that as a sign and a response from God. They've been together 42 years since that first date to Prom and they've been married 38 years and have two wonderful sons.   Now, they've hit this very difficult patch in their road and some of us were looking for a way to help. If you'd like to join in, please do. A family friend has set up an online Tupperware Fundraiser and it's shared on our Class Facebook Page. Please contact us if you'd like that link sent to you.

He works as a truck driver in Austin, Texas and his wife Keizhia works for the city. Recently Keith experienced abnormal symptoms and scheduled a doctor visit. After a brief consultation with his urologist, a tumor was spotted with the sonogram, so the doctor scheduled surgery to remove the tumor and see what was going on in his bladder. On January 18 Keith underwent surgery and woke up to bad news. The doctor found advanced cancer in and around his bladder. Keith's body has a lot of tumors. The doctor removed a lot of the tumors and tissue, but informed Keizhia that Keith’s bladder would most likely need to be rebuilt. Keith needs to begin treatment for his cancer and this will certainly include more surgeries; pathology results from the biopsy will help guide his treatment. Unfortunately there were more pressing matters after Jan. 18; post-surgery complications including numerous and painful blood clots required emergency surgery on Jan. 20 and kept Keith in the hospital.  Bladder cancer is rare and typically affects people over the age of 50. Keith is only 33 years old and doesn’t drink or smoke. He is an amazing man and father and we need him to continue his life's journey with us. He has always advocated for those less fortunate, even actually giving his shoes off his feet to a homeless man once. The Carlyle family needs your help now. Even with health insurance and stable employment, the family cannot afford the sudden and rising medical costs. The initial $1,500 out-of-pocket deductible for the Jan. 18 surgery wiped out their account and they were unable to pay their mortage in full, plus they have exhausted their paid sick and vacation time.

The scan showed that the cancer has in fact spread further and faster than first anticipated.  The original timeline of several months to a year has been brought down to just weeks.  Having to cope with such tragic news was a devastating blow to the whole family and to make matters worse we now realize due to the shortened timeline we are not prepared to cover the staggering and immediate cost of the funeral services.

Melissa Long recently gave birth to Skylar Selene Long, their pride and joy. Everything went well with the delivery but there were some complications that arose post-partum. It was identified that Melissa had developed a high grade complete small bowel obstruction, preventing her from eating or drinking for many days and causing her to vomit frequently.  This obstruction required a major surgery to clear the blockage. Melissa had two prior major abdominal surgeries as a child because of kidney cancer and that was where the scar tissue/adhesions had come from. The contractions during labor caused them to tighten and obstruct her bowel. The surgery was a success but following the surgery, Melissa maintained a consistent heart rate of 150's-160's. Several tests were performed to determine the cause of the elevated heart rate. It was determined that the trauma from the surgery and the earlier delivery, along with severe dehydration, was the cause of the post-op issues. Melissa was then transferred to the ICU to be monitored. She has had multiple complications arise since then, one of the worst being two blood  clots in her right arm. Her discharge date is still in question.  The transfer to the ICU forced her husband, Stan, and her new daughter, Skylar, to go home to await her discharge. Both parents are unable to work during this time and are expecting elevated hospital bills due to numerous complications.

Her husband, Harley, has been diagnosed cancer with rare circumstances. He has diffuse large B cell Lymphoma multiple large masses on his kidney, spleen, and the worst is pushing into his heart. THE POPE FAMILYMy sister has been married to Harley for 20 years and has 3 amazing children, Nicholas (19), Alex (16), and Anthony (13). She works at 3M, a company that produces medical products, as a machine operator, in a rotating 12 hour shifts. Harley, who is no longer able to work due to his condition, was a CNC Operator/Machinist at Twin City Fan, a company that builds fans for other companies. (i.e. Fans for tunnels, mines, buildings, etc.) Nicholas is now working at the same company as his father and living at home to help the family. Alex is a Sophomore in HIgh School with a strong GPA and involved in Spanish Club, Oral Interpretation & Color Guard. Anthony is in the 7th grader and could not be more excited about his electronic games (i.e. MineCraft or any games that require design and maintenance). THE STORYLast week, May 1st, Harley went into the hospital as he was having a hard time breathing when he went down one flight of stairs. Once seen by the local physician, he (Physician)  decided to review his (Harley’s) vitals & requested chest X-rays, EKG, and blood work to help figure out why his heart rate was so high (140 beats per minute - should have been 70 beats at rest). After waiting for the test results, the physician decided to send Erica & Harley to the Emergency Room for further evaluation. In the ER, they re-tested the X-rays, EKG, blood work, and conducted a CAT scan. The results showed that there was 7.8 x 6.3 cm mass that was pushing into his heart, which put his heart into a-fib. They decided the best option was to go to Sioux Falls, a town 1 hour away that has hospitals with better equipment for validation of current diagnosis. They checked into Avera McKennan Hospital on Tuesday where they monitored his oxygen and heart rate. On Wednesday, Harley had an EKG on his heart and an ultrasound on his neck - they did the same thing on his legs to check for blood clots. When they performed a CAT scan of the abdomen, they found a mass in his kidney and spleen,. They told him that his lymph nodes are/were enlarged and there were spots on his liver. He spoke with his surgical doctor and they mentioned that the mass on his heart was inoperable because it was pressing into the heart and/or possibly growing into/through the wall of the heart. A tech team came in over the evening and removed 32 ounces of fluid that was surrounding his left lung. They then discussed next steps with a cancer doctor to perform a biopsy to find out what kind of cancer he has and is fighting - lung or kidney cancer, to determine how to attack. On Thursday, at 930am they came to do a biopsy on his lympnoids in his neck and indicated they would get results on Monday or possibly Tuesday of the following week. On Friday, he was sent home from the hospital. Once home, the doctor called with the results that he has disfussed large b-cell lymphoma. (Non-Hodgkin lymphoma), a Stage 4 Blood cancer because of his heart. On Monday, May 7th, they returned to Avera McKennan Hospital, this time the Cancer Institute, to meet with the doctor, get more tests done and receive treatment options. He and Erica were able to come home but needed to report back on Tuesday to get another CAT scan. The test showed the cancer in his chest area. which was already known but the main concern was his heart. On Wednesday, we was finally able to receive a MRI to take images of his chest to evaluate the extent of the damage. On Thursday, the Pope family received the news the mass has grown into his heart, creating a hole, that is of great concern. The doctor started chemo very slowly as the worry is that if the chemo is administered too quickly, the mass will be pulled out of the opening, creating a leak in the heart. If the heart leaks too quickly, Harley would not survive. By going slowly, it could give the heart time to heal with the shrinking of the mass. The doctor plans on going ahead on this treatment for about a month. The family will be praying for the best. Harley currently feels really well, and is positive that everything will go well. Please keep our family in your thoughts and prayers. [Thank you Harley & Erica for sharing your story.]HOW YOU CAN HELPCurrently, my family is taking this one day at a time, one moment at a time. Since Harley is no longer able to work, the pressure has now been placed on my sister to hold the family above water while providing the proper care for her husband. Harley has health insurance but with a family deductible, 20% co-pays, and unknown extent of the upcoming treatments, any and all help that you can provide with give my sister and her family on less thing  to worry about and focus more on the hopeful recovery of Harley, husband & father. They need to raise at least $50,000 to aid my sister’s family for possible heart surgery and any additional donations will go toward helping to pay for hospital bills (including chemotherapy) and cost a living while Harley recovers.They cannot do this without your help, which is why I am asking you to share this GoFundMe page, spread the word, and donate whatever you can to help.",f1a77a69855a7f03c9dc28caee3ca382,47,0.34176,270.0,5,1,mixed,0,1,0,1,0,0.001002004008016032,0.0,0.5234948604992657,1.4114553112135197,0.0,gofundme

That one person is the love of my life, Joey Roberts, a 32-year-old father of one. In 2008, Joey was first diagnosed with kidney cancer. At the time his cancer was contained and the doctors were able to remove the tumor located where his left kidney should have been. Joey fought a courageous battle against kidney cancer, and won, or so we thought. Early this year, Joey started feeling fatigued and having bouts of severe pain in his back and hip. Then, this summer, the lymph nodes in his neck became swollen. The doctors decided to do a biopsy and it showed that the cancer came back at stage 4 and had spread to his lymph nodes, ribs, chest and spine. When kidney cancer spreads like this, there are limited treatment options, and no cure. Statistically, the long-term prognosis for Joey at this stage of kidney cancer is frightening.I was raised to never be drowned by the negative in life, to battle through, to always find the light. When I met Joey, I knew he lived exactly that way as well; I knew that whatever our souls are made of, that his and mine are the same. Even I, strong as I believe I am, am truly afraid of what the outcome could be, as I am sitting ringside watching this nightmare unfold. There is no doubt, Joey is in a fight for his life. However, we are finding the faith and are determined to stay positive and strong. He wouldn't have it any other way. We’re committed to doing everything possible to stop this deadly disease that’s threatening to take him from us, and that is why we are coming to you. Joey was admitted to Moffit Cancer Center in Tampa, where he began his treatments. He was able to endure two sessions of chemotherapy and radiation, a total period of six months time. At the last CAT scan we were heart broken to find out that the treatment was unsuccessful and that the tumor in his spine had actually grown. It is now pressuring his nervous system and taking away his ability to do even the simplest of things, like sitting up or hugging his son, for more than a few moments without extreme pain. In the last six months, Joey has lost a total of 50 pounds and is unable to walk or even feed himself. You may think this is sad but common at this stage of the game, and that is because you don't know our Joey. Faithful, strong, smart, loving, dedicated-- these adjectives describe him but also do him no justice because he is so much more. Joey has worked at Gold’s Gym in Dr. Phillips in Orlando for five years, devoting his life to improve his clients' health and lifestyle. Physically, you would be hard-pressed to find someone more fit, with more energy. You could not outwork him, you would be silly to even try. There were no off days, no rest days, being physically fit and encouraging others to do the same isJoey's life's calling. Anyone who has met him can agree that he has the heart of a champion, that his motivation in life is his family and that he is the most kind and encouraging trainer you can possibly be paired with. His ultimate goal is obviously to beat this cancer, but the reason is to help other patients along the way-- to give hope. We have found an amazing clinic that can help Joey win this battle and unfortunately his insurance does not cover this treatment. Joey has not been able to work since he started his chemotherapy and I am only able to work a few days of the month so I can take care of him. We have been living off our life savings and well from the support from his mom. As if enduring this terrible disease wasn't hard enough, the stress of the financial burden has become nearly impossible to handle. The fact that his life depends on our financial circumstance leaves us no choice but to ask for your help. We don’t have the necessary means for him to get the available treatments to improve his immune system, the quality of his life, and ultimately, help him to keep living until there’s a cure. We need the  support of our family, friends and anyone who is companioate torwards our journey  to access these treatments and help Joey maintain some financial stability. Any contribution will make a difference in Joey’s life today and in the future. It is beyond devastating for all of us to see Joey go through this unbelievable struggle. Should you choose to contribute or not, we sincerely ask for your prayers for healing, strength, comfort and grace for Joey and his family. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts",7ef3a13a7011574d17d896b616e349a6,40,0.5219,1500.0,0,1,kidney cancer,0,7,1,5,1,0.008158508158508158,0.0011655011655011655,0.09725848563968668,11.957260166639575,1.0,gofundme

November 14th, 2016...7 months to the day that I received my first diagnosis (Type 1 Diabetes), and just 7 days after celebrating my 3rd Birthday...I am back in the same place to receive yet another life changing diagnosis...a coconut size Tumor growing off of my left kidney taking up half of my abdomen. As my doctors and surgeons contemplated the safest, most effective approach to start my fight against cancer, they chose surgery. The next day, I underwent a 7 hour surgery to remove the tumor along with my left kidney, adrenal gland and lymph nodes. My doctors were sure they knew the type of tumor that had rapidly grown inside my little body was that of a Wilms Tumor, rare but the most common kidney cancer in children my age. Although we were prepared to fight back against this cancer, we could not move forward without confirmation. After one week of trying to process the diagnosis we thought we were going to receive...the pathology came back to be anything but what we had expected or heard of. The diagnosis was a Malignant Rhabdoid Tumor of the Kidney. An extremely rare and aggressive cancer, with only 20-25 new cases each year in the United States. I spent 11 days in the hospital recovering from major surgery and consulting with my oncologist on understanding what is soon to be the most crucial fight of my life. I was discharged, and sent home Thanksgiving afternoon to spend what will be my last normal week at home for quite some time. On December 1st I will start my new journey, 30 weeks of intense chemotherapy and 17 straight days of radiation. Although I may be little, I am so very strong. My Diabetes is part of who I am, and always will be, but my cancer will not! There is not much research on Rhabdoid tumors due to it's rarity, which is unacceptable for those who are faced with this diagnosis. My goal is to raise money for my medical expenses and awareness to help not only the journey I am currently facing, but any others facing a journey similar to mine. The love and support my family and I have received is almost as overwhelming as my diagnosis itself. We will forever be so grateful for all the love and prayers. Please continue to pray for my family and I as we begin our battle to beat this ugly disease. I WILL come out swinging! Hey Cancer, you picked the wrong little lady...LETS DO THIS!How the Funds will be used:Malignant Rhabdoid Tumor. 3 days after receiving my diagnosis, my family and I learned the rarity of this cancer. As my social worker came into my hospital room to introduce herself, she hands my parents a stack of overwhelming information regarding the clinic which will soon become my 2nd home. Along with these papers, she hands us a Childhood Cancer book containing over 300 pages. As my parents open the index, they frantically search...Malignant Rhabdoid Tumor (pg. 98). When they turned to page 98, they were in disbelief, a 1/4 page paragraph. 1 paragraph, how could this be? Minutes after starting our tour of the clinic where I will receive my treatments, my parents and I were introduced to two nurses who regularly work in the clinic. ""This is the Farner Family, their daughter is the one we will be treating with the Rhabdoid Tumor, very rare- only 20-25 cases per year throughout the country."" As this continued to come out of our social workers mouth, my parents were in shock, and naturally, a range of thoughts race through their minds. Although we do believe with all our hearts my team of doctors are the best in the world to treat me, it is unacceptable for any family to have to go into any diagnoses without more information and research. Due to its rarity, and the limited number of families and communities affected by this cancer- there is not enough funds raised to support its research. Anyone with this diagnosis deserves top-notch research actively being performed by the greatest institutions in the world. Funds raised will be put towards medical expenses I may accrue along my journey fighting this cancer. A large portion of funds will also be put towards building a foundation that will support research and most importantly- raise awareness!",2c410ba6fca2b22d8123fc154a904682,36,1.17975,810.0,6,1,kidney cancer,1,6,5,4,1,0.007978723404255319,0.006648936170212766,0.009301216312902457,7.361984648835182,5.0,gofundme

Donations, kind words and positive thoughts are truly appreciated from the bottom of our hearts.One evening in the summer of 2015, I went to bed under the impression life was great and I was perfectly healthy. Little did I know, I was about to wake up to the scariest news someone can be given. I remember this day like it was yesterday, trying to convince myself that this was all just a really bad nightmare however it was in fact, my reality. I was diagnosed with Renal Cell Carcinoma of the right kidney. I remember sobbing in the Dr.'s office asking questions I never thought I would have to ask in my lifetime. This included what the next steps were, risks of procedures, would this kill me and if so, how long will it take, etc. It was truly a struggle to come to terms with what had landed on my lap in the blink of an eye.The Dr. started scheduling procedures immediately as time was of the essence. After consulting teams of Dr.'s, many appointments, seeing 2 different Oncologists (Memorial and Dana Farber), the plan was finalized to perform a partial Nephrectomy and remove the malignant mass. Luckily, this procedure was successful and the margins came back negative. This meant I was now in remission but still had a long road ahead before I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. The journey consisted of quarterly scans, tons of appointments all over New England and lots of money out of my pocket.After my latest scan, it was said that my right kidney was still creating stones. Not only was my body making stones in an already traumatized kidney, they were developing extremely quickly and extremely large. I've been battling kidney stones since before the cancer but never to this extent. After having multiple ureteroscopy's/lithotripsy's, a percutaneous nephrolithotomy (twice), etc, it's now become a part of my everyday life living through the pain and suffering.My most recent procedure was this past week. I went in on Monday the 27th, where interventional radiology was to gain access to the kidney through my back for the urologist to then remove the stone from the portion of the kidney I have left. This unfortunately was unsuccessful and the Dr. could not gain access from that particular access point. I was told to come back the following day where I would be put asleep and they would try again more aggressively. Tuesday came and I awoke finding the procedure was successful. The Nephrostomy tube was placed and I was sent home. Wednesday, the following day, the Urologist was to remove the stone through the tube. To my surprise, I was informed that I would be given an epidural for the procedure. Let me tell you, not feeling the bottom half of your body is quite scary. I was admitted for the evening for observation and pain management and discharged the next day.As I sit here on strict bedrest recovering with a nephrostomy bag laying beside me, I can't help but stress over what happens next?, is this finally over? how will I pay for it all?, etc.I am reaching out to all of my friends and family for your support. Anything and everything is truly appreciated! It has taken a lot out of me to have the courage to step up and ask for help as initially I felt this was immoral because it's my kidney, my problem. It's come to the final straw and I'm buried alive in medical bills and at this point it is my last resort to reach out to the community I've dedicated my time, talents, effort and even money to for help. Please, any donations would be helpful at this point.Remember, live every day to the fullest as you never know what tomorrow will bring.

She was told that it was terminal. The doctors gave her less then two years to live. But within weeks, her cancer had spread from 2 locations to 5, and within a month, she had cancer spread all through her body, from her Brain, thyroid, lungs, kidney, Cervix, and ribcage. They tried to shrink the tumors in her Cervix, thyroid, and brain with heavy doses of isolated  Radiation treatments, and Amino Therapy. We were hopefully,  but the treatment only had minimal success. Then a few days ago, she was scheduled for her next Amino treatment, but was running a temperature, so the Cancer Clinic advised us to take her into the emergency room where they admitted her, and started running test to see if they could find the cause of the elevated temperature with no real answers found. As of yesterday, January 5th 2019, the Doctors said the Cancer is spreading through her body so fast, that her body is just shutting down. They made the decision to take her off all medications except her pain meds, and put her on Comfort Care. The doctors gave her 3 to 5 days to live, and she is declining really fast. Our family has been by her side, trying to keep her as peacefully and comfortable as possible. I hate asking for help, but this all happened so fast, and my retired Mother has been supporting my sister, and her 15 year old son, since my Sister was diagnosed and had to stop working to start her Cancer treatments, now with the added pressure of the Funeral cost, my Mom is really concerned about how she can handle it all. My family are all chipping in where we can, but, with such short notice, there just isn't enough money to get it all taken care of, and I'm so concerned about my moms heath with all the stress she is under right now. My hope, is that if the financial burden on her, to lay my sister to rest, is handled then she can focus on taking care of herself and my Nephew. Any money raised over the cost of the Funeral expenses will go into an account specifically set up to help my Mother financial take care of my Nephew, who has 2 1/2 years of high school left before he turns 18 and graduates.

This hit his family hard as his wife Karen had medical issues of her own. Getting back and forth to the hospital, grocery store, and taking their youngest son to work had its' own challenges.  His kidney was removed and Mark had many months of therapy and meds.        Then in June of 2017 Mark was diagnosed with that evil cancer again. This time it was lung cancer.  The treatment was the removal of the cancerous part of the lung which was significant.  He was in the hospital for an extended stay and this was financially hard on Mark and his family. He could no longer work in his Radiator shop.  He has gone through numerous rounds of chemotherapy which make him sick and tired all the time.        Then about 2 weeks ago Mark's wife Karen noticed that Mark was having difficulty remembering little things and would repeat things over and over again.  He even forgot taking Karen to a Dr.'s appointment. This was a red flag to Karen and her family.  Mark was immediately taken to their Doctor and surgery was scheduled the following day at UNC to remove the 1/2-inch cancerous mass on his BRAIN.  How can this happen? First kidney cancer, then lung cancer, now Brain cancer.     Karen and Mark need the funds immediately for travel to Marks' doctor.   Travel expenses are taking a toll on his wife and older children.  Then when Mark comes home he will need medical care that may be round the clock along with a laundry list of meds and trips back to the doctor for treatments such as MRI and chemotherapy.       This situation is urgent for Mark and his family. They need your caring and compassionate donations now so that Mark and his family will not go deeper in debt.  This is a long road for the family and any donation from friends, family, high school chums, and strangers will have an immediate impact and provide the much-needed medical and transportation and care that Mark needs today!        Let's make a difference today and give to help Mark during his recovery.

https://www.gofundme.com/support-baby-pheonix,Support Baby Phoenix,2018-08-19,8.0,2018.0,17445.0,20000.0,253.0,68.95256916996047,1470,"Phoenix's StoryA few months ago our beautiful 17 month old nephew Phoenix was diagnosed with a kidney cancer; Nephroblastoma otherwise known as WILMS, which with further scans had shown it had metastasized to his lungs and therefore was determined as stage four. As you can imagine this was extremely difficult to comprehend for our family and his parents; Daniel and Renata, who not only both work, but they also have three other children to care for; Charli age 9, Ryder age 7 and Hallie age 4. Hearing the words Cancer is something of a nightmare and for Daniel and Renata finding out their youngest baby has Cancer has been terrifying and put a huge financial strain on their shoulders as Renata has paused her job as a Nurse and Daniel has been having time off work with the Ambulance Communications on and off. So their focus  has been completely on Phoenix getting through this ordeal and also giving a normal life to their 3 other children. Initially he was in hospital for well over a week, where he underwent multiple biopsies, tests and had a porta-cath implemented to begin the long and harsh process of chemotherapy. He was then in and out of hospital with fevers, which proved to be difficult to keep under control, so was a very upsetting process from the beginning. It was obvious he had a long road ahead; with his chemotherapy rounds to shrink the tumour and lung metasteses, possible radiation and harsher chemo and surgery to remove the tumour mass and one of his kidneys, not to mention his post recovery and further chemo later on. The fight through ChemotherapyAt the beginning, Phoenix had to undergo six gruelling weeks of chemotherapy each Friday to try and shrink the tumour mass and the lung spots. Like the strong fighter he is, he got through all rounds of chemo with a smile but ended up with a very low immune system, lethargic and losing most his hair. With his immune system compromised from treatment and having cancer, he ended up getting Chicken Pox toward the end of his first lot of chemo.  Phoenix had to be admitted to Hospital to have anti-virals for 7 days intravenously to help stop the chicken pox from replicating, because his immune system was less likely to be able to fight it than others. His surgery was moved back a week to make sure he was no longer infectious. This also meant financially it set them back further.The results of treatmentThroughout the chemotherapy rounds, an ultrasound showed that the treatment was beginning to show signs of it working;  it showed the tumour had shrunk from 10x9.2x10.2cm (490mls) to 6.7x7.9x6.3cm (170mls), we all begun to feel less afraid and more hopeful. At week six of chemotherapy however, he had another CT scan to see if the cancer has gone from his lungs, unfortunately he still had the 3 lesions he started with however they had shrunk in size.This meant that after surgery he would need to have 4 additional weeks of chemo, and instead of 1 day a week, they would need to go 5 days a week and that he would also need lung radiation too. The prognosis was still remaining positive, however this extra treatment brings more risk i.e. potential to cause blood cancer in the future and the radiation itself can cause cancer and a lot more time off work for Daniel and Renata.His SurgeryPhoenix's  6 hour surgery went according to plan. As well as the kidney and tumour, they took some of his adrenal gland and some lymph nodes for testing. He had a nasogastric tube in and couldn't eat the first night. He also had a wound catheter in to give him pain relief for at least 3 days. Post Surgery recoveryPhoenix began eating, drinking and smiling again, as well as slowly walking just 4 days after surgery. He really has been a fighter through it all and his strength is amazing. He did however have high blood pressure for a few days so was put back on hypertension medication to control it. Phoenix had an ultrasound to double-check his left kidney was functioning fine. With some children, it takes a few weeks for the hypertension to resolve itself after the kidney and tumour come out.CurrentlyPhoenix now has a new regimen due to the lung metasteses not resolving by Week 6. It will be 6.5 months of treatment before they get close to the end of it all being week 33, which is around the start of May. That being said, it doesn't include any delays for low blood counts or other hospital admissions that could delay chemo delivery. Renata and Daniel are hoping for no delays so that he can be all done as soon as possible and before his 2nd Birthday on June 2nd, 2019.He had 2 weeks of post Op recovery in total. Now is going to have 8 x daily sessions of radiation to his entire chest and the right side of his abdomen to ensure that any microscopic cancer cells that may exist are destroyed. They believe to get to his lungs, the cancer entered his bloodstream at some point. The radiation will hopefully also help to kill the cancer that is still on his lungs. The radiation takes about 6 weeks to have any affect though. Because of the lung metasteses, he will have his chemotherapy regime altered and will now be taking 5 chemo drugs instead of 3 over the next 6 months. The two new drugs target small cell lung cancers, amongst other cancers. These drugs are given over an hour or so but unlike the others, he is required to have 2 hours pre-hydration each day and then 3 hours post-hydration. It takes 5 sessions to deliver the required dose, so he will be an inpatient when having these drugs. These are given 4 times over the next 6 months so this means 4 x 5 day hospital stays over that time have been added in. If all aligns, some of the radiation sessions will likely be given while he is an inpatient starting the new drugs, and then continued after he gets out until he has had all 8. He will have a CT done in a few weeks time, following that round and another of chemo having been given. They will check to see whether the lung spots are still shrinking and responding to treatment. He will continue on chemo and have regular checks to see if the lung spots are gone. Once they are. So again, another gruelling ordeal Renata and Daniel have to be strong for. They also recently had to go to Gold Coast University Hospital for his G-CSF injection. The injection helps to stimuate growth of white blood cells and will therefore help boost his immune system. He will need this each time he has the same chemo drugs as this week.As you can see his story is a long one but we thought if you take the time to hear out his story and the harsh journey he has been on so far, from the start until now, you can imagine how exhausting, terrifying and financially straining it has been for his family and you can really feel for them as we do. Phoenix is such a happy natured baby who has proven to everyone that he has a fighting spirit by still being the same charismatic boy through this whole ordeal and as you can see by the photos, he does not stop smiling but with such a long fight ahead until this is hopefully over in May of 2019, we just want to make it easier for Daniel and Renata to be by his side without having to worry about their finances. Originally we had set the goal at $10,000 but as his surgery was delayed from having chicken pox, then going through his post op recovery with blood pressure issues and as the radiation and harsh treatments progress until next year, Daniel and Renata need to be by his side more and at the hospital weekly and are realising that this whole process is becoming more costly then first anticipated, so we have now increased the goal to ensure that Daniel, Renata and their children are ok financially while they take more necessary time off work. They are the most selfless hard working people, who always put others needs before their own and now we can all have the chance to put them first, if you can donate, even just a small amount would help our beautiful Wissmanns through their babies toughest fight yet!",23cb574486ac02da49b9f4ee58f1d0a6,48,0.87225,180.0,6,0,mixed,0,4,1,1,1,0.0027210884353741495,0.0006802721088435374,0.19523510971786834,4.0,1.0,gofundme

In mid-August, Shawn found out that he had a tumor in his kidney and other concerning masses in his lymph nodes and on his lungs. By the end of the summer, he was diagnosed with Stage 4 Renal (Kidney) Cancer. Immediately, his doctors got to work forming a treatment plan. At first they had hoped to perform surgery to remove Shawn’s kidney. But now they have begun to focus on the lungs where the masses are growing rapidly.    Shawn is the oldest of four and a typical first-born (at least according to my childhood memories).

Lisa was diagnosed with cancer. The Oncologist diagnosed it as Kidney cancer and that she had a very large mass. The doctor said it needs to be removed as soon as possible. On Sept 22nd Lisa went into surgury to remove the 3 pound mass. During to procedure we almost lost her.  She spent the next day on life support, then slowly started her road to recovery. They sent the mass to the Pathology lab, a few weeks later, we received news that she actually had Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. A type of blood cancer. Pet scans of her body showed that it had spread throughout her body and the cancer specialist said it was stage 4. Though that cancer specialist feels very optimistic to be able to cure her with chemo, it still has been a stuggle.Having 3 extended stays at the hospital, several doctor visits, several set backs, a home care nurse, the costs of medications, Lisa not being able to work, me working only part time to care for her and insurance not paying for everything. Our expenses have become unbareable.I'm not one to ask for help, but I've come to a realization that we need it.

She is entering her third year of Girl Scouts, and is active in Sunday School, choir, and the Kids Dance ministry at her church. She likes playing with makeup, painting her nails with her sisters, singing, coloring, drawing, and helping Shonda prepare and cook meals.Last May, Jerzi was diagnosed with Wilms kidney cancer subsequently the tumor and kidney were removed. She had cancer treatments for nine months and had a teacher come to her home to make sure she didn’t get behind in school. As Shonda is Jerzi’s primary caregiver, she took that time off from work to take care of her. Upon completion of the treatments, they got the news that the cancer was in remission and Jerzi was able to return to school, which also meant that Shonda could return to work.A week after that incredible news, Jerzi was hit with a fever that wouldn’t break. Blood work was done, an infection was found, and she was taken to the hospital immediately. Once she was admitted, Jerzi had additional tests and was told that the cancer had spread to her lungs. She had surgery to remove nearly 2 liters of fluid from her chest, and a CT revealed that the cancer had returned to the area where the tumor and kidney were removed 10 months prior and was now in Stage 4.Jerzi will be hospitalized a minimum of 6 days every month for at least the next year. She’ll also have appointments twice a week in between her treatments. These appointments can land her in the hospital, which has been the case three times already, due to a fever and low lab results. Her oncologist says that this isn’t uncommon during treatments and to be prepared for it to happen regularly.In addition to her treatments, Jerzi needs to see speech, physical, and occupational therapists to help deal with the side effects of the treatments.With her in-patient treatments, follow up appointments, therapy, and unplanned hospitalizations, Jerzi isn’t able to attend school with her classmates, so Terry and Shonda will also need to schedule time for a teacher to come to their home again.Shonda took 9 1/2 months off of work to take care of Jerzi after her diagnosis last May, and with this recent diagnosis, she will be on leave with minimal to no pay for the next 18 months in order to care for her, because Jerzi doesn’t qualify for medical home care.Terry and Shonda are doing the best they can for their grandchildren, who need them greatly. This GoFundMe page has been created to assist them with household and living expenses during this difficult time. In addition to donations, we are also asking that everyone keep the family in your thoughts and prayers as they continue to assist Jerzi through her medical journey. They all love her so much and want nothing more than to see Jerzi beat this cancer and rise to victory. Your heartfelt prays and donations are so greatly appreciated!Thank you so much for your time and consideration.",e3c7498e3150a4a8a02efbcf3a037759,16,0.0971,300.0,1,1,kidney cancer,0,1,1,1,1,0.0017889087656529517,0.0017889087656529517,0.926962676962677,1.7279686718373257,1.0,gofundme

I decided to get my four year old son and me dressed and head to the emergency room. While being seen, the doctor ordered blood work, x-rays, and CT scans. After anxiously waiting for hours, the doctor walked in with hesitation and told me that I have KIDNEY CANCER! I laid there alone, numb, shocked, and in total disbelief. I immediately contacted my family, which came to my aid to support and embrace me. Shortly thereafter, I was transported to UPMC for further testing. Several doctors and surgeons came to see me to discuss the nature of my illness, which was described as my ""A Team."" After extensive testing, I learned that the cancer started in my kidney and had spread to my lungs and throat. Day 2 in the hospital, one of the doctors had came to me to discuss my medical history and stated that ""if this is the type of tumor we think it is, its linked to people that have sickle cell traits. Right at that moment my mom replied and said, ""Erica has sickle cell traits,we known that since she was a baby"".  The doctors still weren't a 100% sure of what I had and the diagnosis, so they scheduled a biopsy on September 24. The surgery was performed on my neck to remove some of the tissue for testing. Several days passed and on October 5, the oncologist confirmed that I had Renal Medullary Carcinoma.  He explained to me this was a rare type of cancer and aggressive, therefore my treatment had to be more aggressive. My doctor advised me that he had already referred me to the Hillman Treatment Center and to expect a call very soon. October 15 was my first day of chemo and February 1 I had my kidney removed. So far everything is going good, but I still have one more surgery to go. Doctor's don't have much research or studies on this cancer because its so rare and life expectancy is anywhere from a couple months to a year. I have a feeling I'm going to be success story. I'm asking for help because my insurance company is denying my claims, claiming that my cancer is a pre-existing condition, which is incorrect. I have numerous medical bills, a car, house, child, and other needs that I still have to upkeep. I ask that if you're able to please make a donation and spread the word about my situation.

Unfortunately, it is a rare cancer, and an even rarer type. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, she had surgery to remove her left kidney including the tumor inside, a tumor in her neck, and multitude of impacted lymph nodes. From Cathy's CaringBridge blog : ""My mind is so busy - when I wake up [in the middle of the night] I have to be very purposeful about what I will allow myself to think about because - BAM - cancer is always just right there.""Because the cancer had metastasized and is in the lymphatic system, Cathy needs to begin treatment ASAP. Unfortunately, there is no proven treatment for this type of cancer. Therefore, Cathy has to travel to several hospitals to explore experimental treatments before she can even begin.The latest update as of Jan 7th, 2017: Cathy has arrived in NYC for a second opinion at Memorial Sloan Kettering medical center.

Today was the first day on the new dosage and he can tell a positive difference. Also, on Monday we got the approval from the insurance company to pay for the Inlyda, which is the really expensive med to shrink the tumors on the adernal glands, after 45 minutes on the phone going over everything the first bottle will be delivered tomorrow!!

Wednesday he had the blood work done, we got the results on Friday. The test confirmed his adrenal glands are failing. We have ordered his medical alert bracelet ""Adrenal Insufficiency"".

We are keeping our amazing doctor and going a different route to shrink the tumor to a 'manageable size' then we will consider removing them along with the adrenal glands, or HD IL2, or another study.

Thanks to ALL who have donated, and please continue to share our campaign.**** Original Post ****My husband has been battling Stage 4 Kidney Cancer, since October 2017, and we are in dire straights May 2018. Please read our story below. We are not ones to ask for help, and this is honestly a last resort.  #kickingkidneycancer is exactly what we need to do!He had a kidney removed in February 2017, pathology showed it consisted of Rhaboid & Spindle Cells - these duplicate other cells in the body, so his kidney had an 8 cm mass of muscle in his kidney. This was determined to be Stage 3. We were blessed with 6 months of clean scans, however that came to an end.October of 2017, when the scans were done, we were informed the cancer had metastasized to both of his adrenal glands and his right lung. The first part of November was a biopsy on the mass in the lung, we did not get a good sample so the day after Thanksgiving we were back getting the mass on the right adrenal gland biopsied. When the results came back on December 6th, we were informed it was back with a vengeance. We were told 2 options, a pill that can 'keep it at bay' for up to 2 years, or HD-IL2, this consist with long hospital stays in ICU to get the meds delivered and then weeks of recovery time, then wash rinse repeat.We wanted... NEEDED ... a second opinion. The Oncologist we had at the time was on board, and she referred us to UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.  We got our appointment at the end of December 2017, when we met with the new oncologist we were given 2 more options, removal of the adrenal glands, or seeing if he was eligible for a clinical trial that used to drugs together (immunotherapy) and pin point radiation to put this crap in to remission. This is also when we learned that Chemo was not an option for the treatment of kidney cancer as it is resistant to it. We opted to go with the clinical trial. Starting in January he started with blood work, scans, biopsies, fittings for the radiation, genetic counseling, and meeting all doctors. Even though this is a clinical trail, the only portion we are not responsible for is the medicines for the infusions, everything else is our responsibility. We are lucky to have health insurance to cover these things. Treatment got underway on February 12, 2018, with a biopsy, February 14, Valentines Day, he had his first infusion, February 16, was the first radiation of the mass on the right lung, then February 17, about 8pm, Ray was admitted to the hospital for a 4 day stay due to a high fever with no underlying cause, after lots of fluids, some antibiotics and rest, he was released on Tuesday, during his stay he did continue his radiation. Being the trooper he is, he went back to work on Wednesday. Now he is a Truck Driver, thankfully he drives locally and is home everyday. About 2 weeks later he had his 2nd infusion, this was about the middle of March. On March 23, he had additional scans done to measure the tumors. On Monday March 26, is was biopsy time, on Wednesday March 28 was suppose to be 3rd infusion... however God had other plans, on Tuesday march 27th Ray spiked a high fever, and the doctor said to just give some tylenol since we were seeing him the next day. On Wednesday we went to the appointment, blood work, and seeing the doctor... fever was back, heart rate was high... things were not right. We were advised if the fever kept up to go to the ER. We live in Arlington and the Hospital is in Dallas, so each ER trip is done by me, getting him 25 minutes away as quickly and safely as possible.Thursday, the nurse called and we informed her the fever had not broken at all and it was still constant, so off to the ER we go. We learned that when you go to the ER with a fever and no underlying cause, you are considered SEPTIC, and there is a protocol that has to be followed. Unfortunately for the medical staff, I have a protocol as well, being in the trial, we have to monitor all medicines that fo in the body, certain things will interfere with the  immunotherapy and causes issues, so our oncologist has to approve ALL MEDICINES.. and some doctors don't like to be told NO... but I have a direct line to the doctor and I use it to protect my husband!!!So on March 29, we started another hospital stay. In the ER is when the decision was made to put him on Medical Leave form work, we have Short Term Disability, but getting it became a long process. This hospital stay lasted through Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Finally on Tuesday he got released. After 2.5 days of antibiotics with no improvement, a call to the doctor got steroids started and a HUGE improvement happened. This brings us to April 25, finally had 3rd infusion, and no money from short term disability, into May scans happened on May 10th and we go for the last double medication infusion on May 16. The original back to work date was set for May 21, this is not happening as day 4 - 6 is usually when he has the hardest time after his infusions. This is were the financial issues come in to play, we are responsible to cover health insurance premiums while he is off work to the amount of $232.60 per week, right now we responsible for paying 8 weeks. We still have our mortgage for May & June to consider, and car payments for 2 months as well, on top of usual monthly bills, cell phone, electricity, gas, water, car insurance, and every day needs as far as grocery, gas for the car for me to get to work, and to the hospital for visits. I work daily and taking the kid to school, and well and his activities and church activities we have on a weekly bases. It is now the middle of May and we have to have Health Insurance Premiums paid by June 1 for all 8 weeks, as well and we still need to make mortgage and auto payments for May. These are a necessity, we can not loose our health insurance.  We have an amazing church family, we have received help form anonymous donors back in February, and someone paid for our sons Camps and Church Trips he will be taking this year, that is a HUGE help, but reaching out for these issues is not easy for us. We just don't know where to turn.  When I was up in the middle of the night I started praying and talking to God about my troubles, and he spoke to me assured me this was the way to go. I want to thank you in advance for reading my story and helping if you can.",1b8e94444c9c5189afb5ff4bd58efbf6,61,0.33125,270.0,6,1,kidney cancer,0,1,0,1,0,0.0006195786864931846,0.0,0.2666900913562895,1.9562091862214102,0.0,gofundme

I am a 26 year old student studying at Sacramento State and my dream is to own and operate my own business. I have been diagnosed with stage 4 Renal Medullary Kidney Cancer. Doctors have deemed this cancer untreatable and have no cure for it at the moment. I have always lived a healthy and active lifestyle so, this news was unpredictably shocking. Due to this illness being such a rare disease, my access to experts familiar with this terminal illness is limited. I have full faith in my healer and I know we will win this fight, but along this uncharted territory, I need support financially. My target facility is MD Anderson in Texas. My coverage does not help out of state, so alot of money will have to come from out of pocket. Funds are needed and not limited for transportation, consultations, treatment, fees, bills, and food. All money raised will go towards the financial needs that arise during this fight. Doctors have made a prognosis of 2 years but I serve a mighty God and know that I have freedom to live in his name. With that, I am unable to work, so funds are an important need right now. My life has been a story to share. I've always lived to serve and inspire. In a fight for my life, the support I receive from everyone showing love has returned that inspiration and encourages me everyday I wake.  Once this fight is won, I want everyone who has contributed to receive a special gift from me and I want to help other young people dealing with these serious rare cancer cases.

These words should never be heard by any parent. 

My then 17mos old daughter was diagnosed on 9/19/2017 with Grade 3 Anaplastic Ependymoma, a aggressive malignant brain tumor. We just had our third child not even a month prior, and our oldest daughter was only 4yo.

To say we were devastated would be an understatement. 

One EVD placement, two brain surgeries, countless spinal taps and MRIs later- we now reside 730mi away from home at St Jude Children's Hospital. 

Please consider donating to our family during this trying time. It is important for us as a family of five to stay together and focus on what is truly important- our daughters health and treatments.

I am a sophomore in college and I have two older brothers, Maxwell Bernard and Lucas Bernard. Maxwell is 28 and works as an accountant for Prudential and Lucas is 22 and will be attending University of Illinois at Chicago next year for their Nursing program. At the end of March, my mom went on vacation to celebrate her 50th birthday with my grandma. They went on a cruise to Mexico and my moms health suddenly began to decline. My mom is usually an extremely out-going person and loves the ocean more than anything. While on the cruise, my mom started to experience really intense pain in her back and the right side of her body causing her to be very slow and not able to get out of bed. Her speech began to slur and she was sleeping a lot so naturally my grandma was extremely concerned. My mom was very forgetful during this time and could not even find the energy to leave her bed while on the cruise. As soon as my mom and grandma got off the cruise, my mom came home to Illinois. Upon her arrival home, she was still in a lot of pain and sleeping a lot more than usual. On Sunday morning, April 2nd, my brother Lucas drove my mom to Centgra hospital in Mchenry. My mom was under the belief that she had a slipped disk in her back and that it was pushing down on nerves that were causing her to have the weird health behaviors. When the MRI came back clean for her back, we were all confused as to what could be happening. Thankfully, they ordered a CT scan and when that came back, we got the start of the frightening news. The CT scan showed a mass directly in the center of her brain about the size of a large lemon. Immediately, she was taken on an ambulance to Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge. That Tuesday, April 4th, was the day I turned twenty and the day my mom had a biopsy done to see what this mass in the center of her brain could be. My family and I hopefully waited for the biopsy to come back but when it did, we could not even believe what we were being told. On that Thursday, April 6th, my mom had been diagnosed with Stage Four Glioblastoma which is a very aggressive and malignant form of brain cancer. My family was absolutely devastated. All I could think was, ""my mom will never see me graduate college. My mom will never see me get married"". For those of you who know me, my mom is my asbolute rock and best friend. The doctor gave us three options: do nothing and she would pass away in within a month, do only radiation or have her undergo surgery then follow up with intense radiation and chemotherapy. We picked option three, because my mom is not ready to be done living her life. She is only 50 and has no grandbabies yet, she is ready to fight. For the next few days, my mom was pumped full of steriods, in hopes to reduce the swelling around the tumor before surgery, and pain medicine because what she was feeling was unbareable.On the next Tuesday, April 11th, my mom underwent a very risky five hour surgery to safetly remove about 20% of the tumor. This surgery was terrifying because the doctor pre-warned my family and I ahead of time that there was a possibility my mom would not make it through the surgery or that if she did, she would never wake up. My whole family and I anxiously waited on the edge of our seats for these next five hours. When Dr. Bovis entered the room, I almost did not want to hear what he had to say. Thankfully, he came back with positive news. The surgery had went as planned and my mom was up in recovery but one small thing had gone wrong. My mom had dystrophy on the left side of her body. Her left arm and leg were extremely tense and she could not feel anything on that side. The doctors are hopeful that with a lot of physical therapy, she will regain some strength on the left side of her body. Since the surgery on April 11th, my mom has been moved to an assisted living facility called Alden Estates of Barrington. Today, April 25th, she began her physical and cognitive therapy. This therapy will be intense and she will want to give up, but she has so many people standing behind her to support her. On Thursday, April 27th, my mom will begin radiation. This radiation will span for 5 weeks and it will be daily Monday-Friday. Anyone who has had a loved one go through radiation knows that this will be a very difficult time. She will become depressed and sick, but we will not give up on her. After radiation is over, she will start to take chemotherapy pills for several months and will have CT scans often to check and see if the tumor starts to grow back. This tumor she has is very aggressive and has a 99% chance to grow back even after we are done with all the treatments. As everyone can gather, the expenses will be astronimical from this. My mom stayed at Lutheran General for three weeks, she has had many ambulance rides(each ride is 500+ dollars) that are not covered by insurance, and is now living in an assisted living facility. Any amount, even a dollar would be so helpful to my family and extremely appreciatedOn this Friday, April 18th, Phi Kappa Psi will be hosting an event called Breaking Barriers. This event is to help break all the gender stigmas, racial indifferences and so on. The sorority I am in, Phi Sigma Sigma, will be working with Phi Kappa Psi during this event and all the proceeds will be going towards my moms medical bills. This GoFundMe is mainly for the people who will not be able to make it to the event. This event will be held on The University of Illinois at Chicago East Campus and will have a DJ, hot dogs and a bake sale. The main attraction for this event will be an old beat down car that you can pay to smash up with a sledge hammer. What a perfect way to release all your anger, right??My mom has three wonderful sisters, Sarah Sommers, Ginger Sommer and Brandy Curtis, that have dropped everything to help take care of their sister. My moms parents live in Texas and have since moved to Illinois to also help aid in the care for my mom. This is an extremely stressful time for my family and I, so we appreciate everyone for being so kind. All my mom wants is to be walking her beloved dog Ollie and gardening, therefore we are doing everything in our power to make this happen.Heres a message from my brother Lucas:""My mom is a fighter. I'm here to support her like she has my whole life, from enlisting as a medic in the US Army to becoming a registered Nurse.

We finally met with Bobby’s neurosurgeon for the pathology report on type of tumor and grade, it is malignant (brain cancer), it’s called astrocytoma grade 3, but we did receive some good news, they discovered that he has a gene mutation of which only 10% of  all patients have. This mutation 1DH1 acts to slow his brain cancer and helps Drs to target the appropriate chemotherapy to kill cancer cells . They are doing more tests to see if there could be more mutations that will help guide them during his treatments. These mutations respond to chemo and or radiation differently and in some cases more effectively. This gives us hope!Bobby will be starting chemo very soon (3-4 weeks after surgery which was 12/18/17)..  This Chemotherapy is required to prolong and could SAVE Bobby's life- These tumors are known to grow back , we just don’t know how fast.

He cares for 3 disabled men , one with Down Syndrome and two with Cerebral Palsy. Bobby cares for these men as if they are his own family  with unconditional love- and these men love and care for Bobby the same. **At this point in time, it’s Bobby’s turn to be cared for...With this devastating news Bobby needs to be lifted up with not only prayers but with financial HELPDuring his cancer treatment Bobby can not work until further notice and can not drive for a minimum of 6months.  Bobby has worked so hard to get where he is in life , Even with odds  stacked against him. The stresses of cancer alone are taxing but now knowing that he has ZERO income to meet his monthly bills and medical copays is adding to it.

His name is Dennis Bosma. Hes 62 years old with a lot of life still in him, considering all the unfortunate events that have occurred over the past 5 years. I'm on here hoping that I can raise enough money to be able to give Dennis a fair chance at the fight for his life. Here's a little bit of what he's gone though, in a nut shell. Five years ago, March 2012 he was diagnosed with endocarditis. Endocarditis is a bacterial bug that you can contract through bad meat or perhaps a dental cleaning. Its main goal once it gets in your system is the get to the heart and destroy it. After many bizzare symptoms and being admitted into the hospital, two days later I had to admit his wife( my mom ) Janet Bosma into the same hospital, same floor because she was so sick. Come to find out she had Chronic Kidney Disease and the doctor told her She's have 6 momths to live. When we were notified that it was time for my dad to be transported to the medical center..I helped my mom get into her wheelchair and I wheeled her down to where dad was. By that time he was already on the stretcher heading out the door. Luckily we caught him in time. Mom couldn't stand but they were close enough to hold each others hand. Mom said ""love you Denny"". He said ""honey I love you too..look at us all broken down."" Which made them giggle a little. That was the last time my dad saw my mom. A week and a half later she died..they had been married 29 years. Two days after getting his heart valve replacement while in recovery still in the hospital he had a stroke. Which left him incredibly dizzy. But he was determined to get his life back. One thing he was set on was to be able to ride his bike again. He used to go on the MS150 bike ride from Houston to Austin. Its a benefit they have every year in April to support Multiple Sclerosis. As I was saying Dennis was bound and determined to get his balance back. Everyday he would walk are the block or around the retention pond in the neighborhood with his cane. It took a little over a year but he was riding that bike. Because of the stroke he was forced to retire early. Financially he had no business retiring but medically he had no choice. He worked as an independent contractor out of Graebel Van Lines for 30 years. He started working off jobs for other members of his church and friends to help make ends meet. He was getting by. 


Well in 2015, Dennis was diagnosed with Lung Cancer. He continued to fight back. He underwent Chemo 3 times, Radiation countless times and even had a portion of his lung removed. The doctors everybody was always saying how great he was doing. We were under the impression that the cancer was gone. 


One morning Dennis woke up with the worst headache of his life. He had to go to the hospital for several test. A couple days later the doctors tells him that the cancer has moved to his brain. His doctor says he has 8 months to live and he really oughta try to find a sort of quality of life. 


Well Its been over a year since the doctors told him that and he is still here fighting. Ever since the doctir told him to find some quality of life he's been repeating that to himself over and over again. I know he has a fighting chance. I'm trying to raise enough money to buy him some hearing aids. Medicare does not cover them in Texas. He is such a fun loving guy w the greatest humor. He enjoys people. Enjoys conversation. But when its hard for you to hear you tend to isolate yourself. He's got a mens bible study he goes to every Monday. He can't hear them. Hes needed glasses for far to long.

While this was not the news we wanted to hear, Juanell is prepared to continue her fight to beat this disease. Because of the aggressiveness of the cancer cells that have returned, Juanell's treatments will be even more aggressive this time.

He even went out of his way to attend a school he was not zoned for, waking up several hours earlier than most for a better education and increase his chances of being offered scholarships and build his college resume. We all have faith he will overcome and surpass this bump along the road so he can pursue his dream and become someone in life.


On October 12, 2016 my little brother Felix Giovanni Balderas went to the Optometrist because he was having trouble with his vision.  He received his prescription and was able to see better, but was still seeing double alongside extremely bad headaches.  The Optometrist found the double vision and the fact that his eyes weren’t dilating to be quite odd; therefore he was referred to a Neurologist.


October 13, 2016 I come to find out the Neurologist had advised my brother had a big cyst in his brain that was compressing his eyes which was the reason he wasn’t able to see properly. That alone was heartbreaking to hear. At this point I couldn’t believe what I was being told. I asked all family and friends to keep Felix in their prayers.


October 14, 2016 the cyst turned out to be a 3cm. brain tumor in the center of his brain.


October 17, 2016 he underwent his first brain surgery where the brain tumor was successfully extracted. That alone was a HUGE relief to our family and friends, we were extremely grateful that he was stable throughout the entire surgery without any complications. We all had tears of joy and extremely thankful for those that kept him in their prayers.


The following day we were told he had to undergo brain surgery once again due to hydrocephalus (buildup of too much cerebrospinal fluid in the brain). This surgery took place October 19th.


We were then told he had another brain tumor that was just about the same size as the one that was initially extracted. We were at a loss for words knowing he would have to undergo brain surgery once again. October 21st he came out of his third surgery stable without any complications, which is a huge blessing.


A few days later doctors informed us the second tumor extracted was cancerous. Chemotherapy and radiation (which will take place in Houston) will be necessary in order for my little brother to be cancer free.


Our family is unbelievably fortunate to have him here. Since his surgeries were intensive they did leave him with some temporary side effects including vision and balance problems. And one permanent side effect, short term memory loss… which could be subject to change only time will tell.


Felix will be undergoing 6 cycles of chemotherapy.  Each cycle is 21 days and so far he's completed one cycle, and is currently in the hospital receiving his second cycle. Once he is finished with his chemo sessions he will be receiving radiation in Houston for well over a month, donations will help comfort their stay without having to worry about any out of pocket expenses while away from home. Though Felix does have medical insurance, the copays, deductibles, and out-of-pocket expenses add up quickly.


Mom has been extremely attentive to Felix, this is something no one expected: Expect the unexpected, hope for the best. At the same time she is also caring for my 1 year old baby sister as well as my 10 year old little sister. Your donations will help pay for Felix’s medical treatment and future treatment necessary. With two younger siblings my family needs the help of friends and family. Please consider making a donation.

Standard treatment is 6 weeks of radiation along with oral chemotherapy (Temodar), followed by aggressively high doses of Temodar for 6 months- which Rob is currently under going. At this point Rob's MRI's are clear & he is tolerating the chemo well, the only side effects are fatigue following his 5 day cycle. Angie is in contact with other GBM patients. They tell her to be prepared emotionally, medically, financially, do your research & know your options before a decision needs to be made. Reccurance is treated by 2nd tier drugs and clinical trials. This is the battle ahead & the odds are against us. Doctors have advised Rob to fight hard, stay positive and get to work on his bucket list. Rob had dreamed of traveling to Europe one day, but the reality is that he and Angie are working & raising 2 girls, supporting them in theater, attending church &family events - all while fighting cancer. At this time Rob feels he cannot use the time, energy & resources necessary to travel to Europe. Instead, he would love to see one of his girls' dreams come true & travel with them to NYC in May to see a Broadway play. They hope to also visit Washington DC & friends in Hershey, PA. Many of you have asked during the last 7 months ""How can we help? What can we do? Do they need financial help?"" We know it will take a financial toll, insurance will push back at some point. Rob will continue Temodar chemotherapy & have MRI's every 3 months, he will continue supporting medications - this is Rob & Angie's ""new normal""- for as long as God wills & Rob lives.

She was forced to get incompletes in all of her college courses; in only her second semester there.  Nicolette is a very intelligent, beautiful, caring and loving young lady.  She has an extremely rough road ahead of her. She planned on working this summer and would like to hopefully retake her courses at West Chester and then start the fall semester there as well.

He had minor brain surgery and biopsy done to find out what exactly this tumor was.  After the surgery he wasnt able to walk for almost 2 days and required a walker once he was able to stand, and after about 2 weeks we were able to take Jose home. Due to the location of the tumor (deep in the left thalamus) we were told that the tumor is inoperable.  Right now the only form of treatment he can receive is chemotherapy.  His first treatment of chemo started in June and will continue chemo every single week for up to 2 years.  During this time he will also require lots of medication, imaging (MRI/CTSCANS), and physical therapy for the tremors in his right hand. I (his dad-active duty military) am grateful to my command for giving me the time i needed to be with my family during these difficult times. His mother (my wife) is a full time student at NSU and works part time at our local Food Lion. It has only been a little over 2 months and we have payed over 3,000 dollars out of pocket so far. We were extremley lucky to have our family and friends help us during this time and we will forever be grateful. Jose will need MRI/CTSCANS at least every 3 months for the rest of his life to track the growth of the tumor.  Like I have mentioned before chemo can go up to 2 years, and if needed, radiation once he is old enough. We were lucky we were able to get such a great staff at CHKD in Norfolk VA.Jose is a very strong  boy, and is taking the treatments like a champ.  He loves video games, loves minecraft, sharks, Starlord from Guardians of the Galaxy, Star Wars, and ofcourse,  spending time with his family.We are not the type of family to ask for help, but for our son we will do anything necessary so he can receive the best treatment he can.

Our son has a very rare type of brain cancer that is only found in 50% of adults in the whole US and a hand full of children in the US. They diagnosed him with Upper Ventricular Neurocytoma Brain Cancer. It is a very rare and aggressive cancer. Within 2 months of 2 seperate MRI's he had 2 seperate times of 25% regrowth after the 1st brain surgery. He just had his second brain surgery June 12th in Chicago, in which they have removed all the brain tumor but he is not in the clear yet. He will NOT be deemed cancer free until ALL his MRI's for the next 5 years come back clear of NO regrowth of tumor. IF any tumor has regrown in any MRI's then he will have to have continuous surgeries until the age of 6, at that time he will have radiation as the Dr doesn't want to expose his brain to radiation this young in age.

It has been almost 3yrs since she was diagnosed with brain cancer known as Non-Germinomatous Germ Cell Tumor or (NGGCT). Jocelynn fought hard and is now cancer free. However she now faces the after effects of treatment and the damage the tumor caused. One of the main issues is with her kidneys. She needs medication to keep them functioning, without it she will go into kidney failure. This medication is very expensive, and at this time Jocelynn is only on medicaid and it is not covered. The family is still struggling to pick up the medication that Jocelynn has been without for a few weeks now. They need help with this right away. Her father has a new job and will have insurance in a few months, but she can't wait that long. Please help if you can and share. Thank you. 7/1/16.....Jocelynn is 18 now and cancer free but not problem free. She still has several issues with her kidneys, diabetes insipidus and has recently suffered heat stroke and sickness from being over heated. The family is still going through a rough time, Jocelynn's mother lost her job and insurance. They are now living in a motel trying to scrape by until she can find another job.

It has been a long year for her. Even though the cancer is gone, she is working through many side and after effects of the tumor and treatment. Her kidneys don't function properly, her thyroid doesn't function as it should, her hormones are all out of wack because the tumor was on her pituitary gland.  She is still on a lot of medication and has to travel between Nevada and San Francisco to recieve proper care. She has good and bad days and is now working on homeschooling because of this. The family could still use assistance to make sure Jocelynn has proper care and travel funds when unexpected issues pop up. Your assistance and kind thoughts are appreciated.For the full story, please read Jocelynn's story below, Thank you. - Aunt AmyMy niece Jocelynn just turned 16 a few weeks ago. She hasn't been feeling well lately and with the assistance of the wonderful panel of doctors at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, we finally got the answers. Jocelynn has been diagnosed with a cancerous tumor on her pituitary gland in her brain. This cancer is known as Non-Germinomatous Germ Cell Tumor or (NGGCT).Please check out Jocelynn's story that was published in the Nov 11th Nevada Appeal...  http://www.nevadaappeal.com/news/local/8865236-113/jocelynn-carson-family-comOn Oct 18th, 2013, Jocelynn's nausea and weakness were far more than she could handle, so my sister took her to the ER in Carson City, NV. After some testing they decided it was best to take her by ambulance to Renown in Reno. Once there the doctors took a look at the situation and decided that the tumor showing up on the MRI was way too much for them to handle. So they put Jocelynn and her mom on a care flight plane to San Francisco. Leaving her dad, younger sister and beloved pets behind. Jocelynn has been at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital since the early morning hours of Oct 19th. After many tests, on Oct 21st we got the news, the tumor in Jocelynn's brain was in fact Cancer. Jocelynn starts Chemo treatments on Monday Oct 28th, 2013. She will need to stay in San Francisco for at least 5 weeks. If everything is progressing as expected, she will be able to go back home to Carson City, however she will need to return to SF for treatments at least 5 days each month. Her father joined her and her mother in SF, leaving her 11yr old sister in Nevada with family. This has already been a huge financial strain on the family as Jocelynn's mother has been with her and is on family medical leave from her job without pay. There have been and will be many medical expenses throughout this ordeal as well as standard living expenses. Due to the family's current rental house having a mold issue and a heating malfunction, they have been forced to find another rental house. Your donation will go towards making sure Jocelynn has a clean, safe home to come back to, with power, heat and food to eat, as well as making sure she has what she needs to recover. Excess will be used for medical and travel expenses that are going to come up along the way. If anyone has anything to spare to assist with this situation, the family would be grateful.The family has been in touch with the Northern Nevada Children's Cancer Foundation for some assistance and support.

Inoperable and probably not treatable. Hospice was recommended. Our life together and our future as a family seemed to be suddenly ripped away before it really even began. WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN? As the mind-numbing gravity of this diagnosis settled in, we knew that no matter what, we would fight this fight together, for as long as we are given. From the second the words seeped from the doctor's lips, our first thought and biggest concern was the children. How do we do this? Ben is father to two beautiful children and step father to two more. He is a remarkable father and the impact he has every day on the lives of these precious kids is immeasurable. He is the rock they have built their young worlds upon. I am in awe of his courage and strength as he has begun the fight of his life with a peace and gratitude beyond my comprehension. God has truly covered him with his grace, which has spread over all of us around him.  We are blessed beyond measure with wonderful, amazing love from our family and friends. The outpouring of love and prayers from everywhere has been a gift that has changed our lives. I know I can speak for both of us in saying that in a very real way, this journey - as painful as it is - has shown us the power and beauty of God's love through the kindness of so many. Some we don't even know. We have been touched and changed by it.  Still, the wages of the battle and the severity of losing are ever present and hard to keep at bay.  This journey is about so much more than money. But the reality of it cuts deep into our financial situation. Uncovered medical expenses, loss of income, and special nutritional needs are piling up. Our family suggested Go Fund Me as a vehicle for raising money to relieve the financial stress and keep up with medical and family living expenses. This will help Ben to focus on healing and loving, which he is so good at.  First of all, we hope you will pray for Ben's healing, and for God's grace and love to continue to lift us up as we support him. Then, if you can help in any way, we pray that your kindness is returned to you many times, and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Keeping the family safe, warm and healthy is first priority, followed by medical expenses. If the gifts exceed what is needed there, the balance will be used toward educational needs of the kids.

She is our sister, niece, daughter, grand-daughter and friend. Those of you who know her know that she is one tough cookie and there is no stopping her when she sets her mind to something. She was to start college this spring but in early November we found out that Monica had a brain tumor the size of a golf ball. Our family is tight-knit but nothing could have prepared us for the word 'Cancer'. How could this happen to such a young beautiful lady who has an entire life of adventures yet to have?A couple of days after she was diagnosed, our family was still trying to wrap our heads around this horrible news, with prayers being sent in from family and friends all over, the tumor hemorrhaged and Monica fell in the bathroom hitting her head and was unconscious. Jessica, her Mom, heard her fall and rushed to her side where Monica was unresponsive. Monica was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance where the doctor had to preform emergency brain surgey. With little answers to what exactly was happening, Jessica had to make multiple heavy hearted phones calls to gather our family together for the unknown of what would happen.The surgery lasted over 8 hours. Our family were on pins and needles, but we put our faith in God and knew that he would see her through. The doctor came into the waiting room and you could hear a pen drop. No one spoke a word in anticipation of what the doctor was going to say. The surgery went smoothly. The doctor advised that most, if not all, the tumor was removed but there were still unknowns and questions we didnt have answers to. The tumor was located at the top of the spine and at the base of the brain. The doctor was unsure if the tumor had spread down her spine or not. More test would be needed to determine if the tumor had spread beyond what the doctor could see.The thing that scared all of us the most was when the doctor said that if Monica would not have woken up to use the bathroom and had not fallen, the tumor would have hemorrhaged in her sleep and she would not have woken up and most likely would have died. God was with Monica.While the surgery was a success, it has been extremely difficult for things returning to normalcy for Monica. With the tumor being located on her spine and at the base of her brain, Monica had to learn to speak again. The first couple of weeks after the surgery she couldn’t think clearly or remember simple words. She had to learn to walk again, to chew, to hold something in her hands. It has been a difficult few weeks and months for Monica and for Jessica, who has not left her side.Monica is now on radiation and chemo. She is still very positive, more-so then any of us would be. She has lost her beautiful long hair, but is still as beautiful as ever.We decided to create this GOFUNDME to help Monica and Jessica with medical bills and other related expensive towards her care. Jessica has not worked since the emergency brain surgery in November as Monica could not be left alone. Jessica has never been one to ask for help as Monica gets her strength from her mom; however, we ask that you continue to pray for Monica and donate any amount you are able.Thank you family and friends for your continued support and love.",3c0fe7a1f951b424b2ad253cac5eb9e9,26,0.7945,750.0,2,1,general,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

Austin is smart, funny, loves school, and has a plan to be a nuclear engineer or a doctor. On November 21, 2018, his plans and our lives changed.On 12/14, Austin was diagnosed with Grade 4 Glioblastoma (brain cancer). Austin will be doing 5 weeks of radiation and chemo at Shands Hospital (45 minutes away). The doctor says that the next 6 months are critical and that it will tell us how this will go, meaning it will let us know if it is responding to the treatment or not. This is an aggressive cancer that does not hold a good prognosis due to there is no cure. The radiation and chemo are to hopefully slow it down and are the beginning steps to a long fight for Austin. The doctor has told my parents that someone needs to be home with Austin for the next year, due to the swelling of his brain is pressing on his optic nerves causing Austin to have very blurry vision.  Due to Austin not being able to see very well, he was recently un-enrolled from school (he LOVED school) and doesn't want to do anything because he can't see good. Through all of this, Austin is a trooper and does not complain about anything and he pushes forward.  Our father is currently on FMLA and is home with him to take him to appointments and our mother is still working because she holds the insurance for his treatment and has not been employed there long enough to take FMLA, though she really wants to be with her son through all this. As you can see this has taken a huge emotional and financial toll on our family and we know that just like Austin can't do this alone, neither can we- his family.  We ask that if you can help, please donate to help with upcoming trips to appointments and medical expenses and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

She was seeing double. After seeing eye doctors and more doctors, we began our journey with this terrible disease. November 4th was a special day for Isabella’s classmates, who were celebrating their First Communion, but for us, it was a day when we stopped breathing and words burned, turning our lives inside out.  While seeing a specialist in a city far away in what seemed to be such a dark place, we were reviewing MRI images and hearing the words, DIPG –Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma…. and trying to block out words  “average survival is less than 1 year” and words like palliative care and radiation. DIPG  attacks the brain stem, the part of the brain responsible for the basics of life.En octubre de 2017, con solo 10 años, Isabella disfrutaba de la primavera y la playa cuando inesperadamente empezó a inclinar su cabeza hacia la izquierda. Confundida, comenzó a ver doble. oftalmólogos y una larga lista de médicos especialistas marcaron el inicio de nuestro viaje por esta terrible enfermedad. El sábado 4 de noviembre para los compañeros de Isabella era un día especial porque celebraban su primera comunión; para nosotros en cambio era el día en que nos arrebataban tanto el aliento como las palabras, y el mundo se nos ponía prácticamente al revés, mientras en una ciudad distante y oscura revisamos resonancias magnéticas y escuchamos las palabras Glioma Difuso de Tronco Encefalico y tratábamos de masticar las palabras “ supervivencia promedio menos a un año” y palabras como cuidados paleativos y radiación.  El Glioma difuso ataca el tronco cerebral, la parte responsable de las funciones básicas para la vida”. Radiation only slightly shrunk her tumor, but it was still there, growing bigger and stealing her life. We could not wait! DIPG is very aggressive and time is running out.  Isabella’s acceptance into an immunotherapy clinical trial in the USA means HOPE. Immunotherapy is Isabella’s Miracle! It is our miracle. La radiación que recibió Isabella solo ha logrado reducir levemente el tumor, pero el tumor sigue presente, creciendo y robando su vida. No podemos esperar más! El DIPG es muy agresivo y no tenemos mucho tiempo.  La aceptación de Isabella en un ensayo clínico de tratamiento inmunológico en los Estados Unidos significa para nosotros verdadera ESPERANZA.  Inmunoterapia es el milagro de Isabella! Es nuestro milagro.Isabella is our only child, our miracle after many losses…Our hearts have been ripped to shreds during the biggest battle of our lives. We’ve cried and poured our hearts out to God. We must fight and we can’t do it alone.   Isabella es nuestra única hija, nuestro milagro después de varias perdidas.  Nuestros corazones han quedado hecho trizas con esta que ha sido la batalla más grande de nuestra vida. Nos hemos encomendado a Dios. Debemos seguir luchando y no podemos hacerlo solos.Immunotherapy is Isabella’s lifeline.  We truly believe that this is our brightest star in the darkness, a ray of light that impacts every breath we take. It is expensive, more than we have.  Sweet Isabella is counting on us to get this done. She trusts us and knows we won’t let her down. Although some costs are paid by the clinical trial, we must pay hospital costs, doctors’ fees and other costs. The best case scenario is $5,000 a month for up to three years, plus living costs in a foreign country while caring for our child with the worst kind of cancer. We need your prayers, your donations--no matter how small. Please share this with your family, friends, and coworkers. Help us with Isabella’s Miracle! Help us defeat DIPG! Give Isabella hope and a future. La inmunoterapia es la gran oportunidad de Isabella. De verdad creemos que esta es la estrella más brillante en esta oscuridad, un rayo de luz que nos impacta en cada respiro que damos. La inmunoterapia es cara, mas de lo que podemos cubrir.  Nuestra dulce Isabella cuenta con nosotros para poder hacerla. Ella confía en nosotros y sabe que no la defraudaremos. Los costos del hospital bordean los US$5.000 cada mes (y podría aumentar) por tres años, sin contar los costos que implica vivir en un país extranjero mientras tratan el terrible cáncer que padece nuestra hija. Necesitamos sus oraciones y  donaciones, sin importar cuán pequeñas sean. Por favor, compartan esto con sus familias, amigos y compañeros de trabajo. ¡Ayúdanos a cumplir el milagro de Isabella! ¡Ayúdanos a vencer el DIPG! Dar a Isabella la esperanza y futuro.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Gracias desde el fondo de nuestro corazón,Jorge, Astrid y Lola, Isabella’s dad mom and pet.“It is only in the darkness, we can see the brightest stars.”  Martin Luther king Jr.“Es solo en la oscuridad que podemos ver las estrellas más brillantes”Martin Luther King Jr.",99736a2c259741b49cba1025be6e4ba6,70,0.079404,360.0,4,1,general,0,7,1,4,1,0.003943661971830986,0.0005633802816901409,0.005285013212533031,12.583849348991057,1.0,gofundme

We decided to take a break from all the stress of everyday life and did a quick 4 day getaway. While away, I was under pain the whole time with crushing headaches and unable to enjoy time there. Coming home we had to insist that we have some tests done to see what was causing the relentless headaches that were now keeping me in bed all day. A major misdiagnosis by a doctor at Juravinski Hospital ER in Hamilton led us back in to getting help by a great oncologist and more tests. He immediately stepped into emergency mode and got us in for a MRI and low and behold there were 2 large lesions in the brain. One tumour was 3cm (golf ball sized) and the other 3mm. He got us setup with a radiation doctor and neuro-surgeon and they laid out our options. They were very bleak. If we did nothing, the diagnosis was less than 3 months to live. So we had to quickly decide; the options were brain surgery which would most likely cause paralysis and would definitely cause permanent brain damage or one of ten types of radiation they offer which can be less effective but cause less permanent brain damage. Chemotherapy wasn't an option because the tumurs were in the brain. We chose radiation to prolong life a bit, maybe up to a year or two. All this news and testing happened before Christmas and really made for a long holiday season of ups and downs. While dealing with the physical and emotional side-effects of this new terrifying condition, we tried to keep things normal for our two year old daughter and made sure she got to meet Santa for the first time.The doctors have said ""You can't work"".  As a result of all this, being a one income family and the 'bread winner' now out of work, bills are a tight squeeze as there is no readily available financial help out there. I am a very proud person and it make me sad to have to ask for help but we could use it truly. I know you're thinking what about insurance. That's the whole problem. There is none so there is no money coming in or no money to pay for even just the little things.  Any help is going to help us help our little one. Our daughter is our main priority and every bit helps. Whether it be just a nice dress, taking her to an activity or a donation to add to her RESP, any extra that you can spare is going to be appreciated more than you can think. Whether it be your coffee for the week or just some change in your pocket, it will help. Many thanks and love to all who donate. I will say a prayer for every one of you.

Nicki and Kenneth have an incredible 9 year old daughter, my niece, Macie!The morning of April 16, 2016, my brother was awakened to Nicki having a serious seizure. He took her to the ER, where a CT was done and showed a mass on her brain. After being admitted, further testing revealed that the mass on her left frontal lobe required surgery almost immediately. The following Tuesday, she underwent a 4 hour brain surgery, which she rocked. Testing of the tumor revealed she is facing Stage 3 Anaplastic Astrocytomas. She will be starting aggressive radiation and chemo treatment in a couple of weeks, but is also seeking a second opinion with MD Anderson is Houston, TX. Nicki recently had downgraded her insurance at work, and she has been told that she'll be off at least 6 months.

One of the nicest people on the entire planet. While that may sound cliche, all you need to do is ask literally anyone who has so much as said 'Hello' to her. Which is why what she is going through is an absolute tragedy.Back in March of 2014 they found a mass in Julie's abdomen and during surgery they found out it was cancerous. Julie was only 45 at the time, now facing a hysterectomy and chemotherapy. The good thing is that, for a short while, the treatments worked. She had been undergoing treatments for years until December of 2017. That is when she got sick they found 2 tumors, in her brain and bones (mainly hip). This is when things got really serious.In the last year she has undergone, chemo, a thing called 'Gamma Knife'(which frankly, sounds horrific), and 'Stereotactic Laser Ablation Surgery'.As of Dec 2018, the last laser surgery she had caused a stroke and she has been in the ICU for the last two weeks. Her short-term memory is gone, and due to her hip surgery she cannot walk. (More details at bottom)Needless to say, Julie is not working, Scott must take time off and the prognosis for Julie is measured in 'months'. Even with insurance, out of pocket costs are nearly unlimited. If this Go-Fund-Me reaches it's goal Scott will have the ability to spend more time with Julie, and if the worst happens it will help clean up bills.The holidays are about GIVING, I can think of no better cause than giving the gift of time to family.Time is the most precious resource they have right now.~Thank you for reading and extreme gratitude for anything you can do to help.If you want more details. . . (From Scott)In May the left tumor (in her brain) grew to twice its size and we hit that with the Gamma Knife for the second time.At the end of July she was having hip pain on her left side, that went on for a few months and found that the cancer had spread to her bone, we hit that 5 times with radiation in October.Mid-November the brain scan found the 2 tumors from last December started to grow again and we decided to hit both of them with Stereotactic Laser Ablation Surgery killing off the right tumor but the left is still active.Thursday the 6th of December she had a 5 1/2 hour surgery and 3 hours of recovery and everything looked good Thursday night. Buy Friday at 3pm she was unresponsive.They put in a breathing tube and a brain shunt to relive the pressure on her brain, Saturday (12/8/2018) morning she started to recover and the breathing tube was removed Sunday morning.On Sunday we found that she had a stroke on her right side affecting her eye, arm, leg and short term memory. She was in ICU untill Thursday afternoon then moved to a regular room. With all the scan being done we have found that the radiation didn't do any good to her hip and it might fracture, we are now looking at hip surgery this coming week.We are more concerned with the short term memory loss, she has shown small improvements.",5b9028b977e9fba2a226087e606329fc,19,0.42525,60.0,6,1,general,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,gofundme

Anyone who has spoken to me for more than five minutes (or god forbid actually crossed one with me) probably knows about my completely stupid and irrational fear of bridges. I have decided that if I can raise enough money for the Cure Brain Cancer Foundation (an amazing foundation set up by Dr. Charlie Teo) I will do the Harbour Bridge Climb. I know it doesn't sound like much, but to me it is a HUGE deal. Approximately 1600 people are diagnosed with brain cancer in Australia annually and around 1200 die from the disease every year. It is also the disease that kills more children than any other in Australia. I am so so close to reaching my goal and am so thankful for everyone that has donated so far. I understand that not everyone can donate financially but even a share of this page would mean the absolute world to me (and so many others). It would really help spread the word. 

Funding and awareness for this horrible disease is so so important in finding a cure so please consider helping my cause...

He graduating from Florida Institute of Technology with his bachelors degree in Astrophysics last May. Shortly after he noticed something was wrong... After starting a job at SMTC corporation he went in for his first of many doctors appointments. After finding out his diagnosis (stage three testicular cancer) he was determined to continue working part time while battling cancer.  After four rounds of chemo, which were five days a week for six hours a day... (LONGGGG days, remember, he was working during these rigorous days) He finally finished his chemo right in time for Christmas and thought he was in the clear. After a follow up the doctors they found a 4mm mass in his left lung and a 4cm mass in his lymph node in his lower abdominal area. He met with a renown surgeon at Moffitt Cancer Center and they told him it was not something to take lightly. An invasive surgery called RPLND would be needed to insure all of the mass was removed and doesn't spread to any other parts of his body. The surgery involves a foot long incision from his sternum to below his belly button. Moving all of the organs in order to get to the lymph nodes which need to be removed. Recovery time includes a minimum of five days in the hospital and 4-6 weeks post op before he can return to work. With in this time he will not be receiving his normal pay if any. So on that note any financial help would be greatly appreciated. Medical bills are piling up along with his normal everyday finances. He has done so much for so many people and could really use the help right now. He has a long road ahead of him and money should be the least of him and his families worries.

He didn’t think anything of it at first, but started to get sick and developed a bad cough. After seeing the doctor and undergoing an endoscopy, we heard the words no family ever wants to hear. Results showed stage 4 esophageal cancer, which has also spread to his lymph nodes and liver. When we received the news, we were all in disbelief - and as this life-altering diagnosis has settled in, we are even more saddened and fearful that our time with him may be cut short if we don’t act quickly. After doing loads of research, our dad has made the decision to decline chemotherapy so that he can try the more natural, holistic approach. In doing so, he is changing his eating habits, exercising, making lifestyle changes and most importantly reducing stress. Down in Tijuana, Mexico, is a biomedical clinic that offers alternative therapy for cancer and provides all-natural healing. Unfortunately, health insurance doesn’t cover the treatment whatsoever. He has three sons, a daughter, a loving wife, seven grandchildren that absolutely adore him, with another on the way. There is nothing that can hold this man down. He always has, and always will be, upbeat and chipper - you will never see a frown on his face. We don’t want to lose our father; he is the glue that holds our family together. He is the best man we could ask for, so we believe he deserves the best treatment to make him well again. He deserves the opportunity to live a long and prosperous life. As firm believers in Christ, we know God is in control and we shall not fear. We thank you for all the love and support we’ve already received from family and friends all over the country. It is with hopeful and humble hearts we ask for your support in this time of need.

A large cancerous tumor had grown around his esophagus and the opening to his stomach was only as large as a dime.  The doctors told him he had less than a year to live.  We got him into treatment at MD Anderson in Houston, Texas.  Leaving home was hard, he missed Alaska, especially in the summer time. But he made it though the whole first course of chemo and radiation. He was doing really well,  they installed a feeding tube and he was able to gain some of his weight back. His PET scans were showing decreased activity. Then Hurricane Harvey came and flooded Sugarland, Texas,  where is treatments were. After the clinic canceled a few of his treatments, because most of the workers couldn't get in to work, they suggested he come back home to Alaska.  They sent his treatment plan back to his doctors up here and he came back home and resumed the 2nd round of chemo here.After the 2nd round of chemo, his cancer team here decided to try the new drug, Ketruda. That drug wasn't as hard on his body and his  cancer was kept at bay for 6 months, they were able to install a stint in his esophagus so that he can swallow food. His scan last week started to show increased  activity.  This is a very aggressive type of cancer, we have found a treatment center in Washington who are willing to tackle his case, possibly attempting to remove his tumor and try experimental drugs. He is very healthy and very strong and stubborn, he won't give up easily. He needs the funds to pay off the $4865 bill that remains at MD Anderson and the $1324 bill at the local hospital here.   Some funds to help with renting him a place in Washington would be awesome,  none of us siblings live within 400 miles of any Esophageal Cancer Treatment Centers, or we would be glad to have him stay with us.  Our Story:Our family is large, there are 8 of us kids. Mom and Dad were from Indiana, they  converted an old Trailways bus into a motorhome and drove up here to Alaska in 1964 with 4 kids and one on the way.Elvin giving Dad a helping hand to get ready for the trip.   Most of the road  was dirt and it rained every day of the trip. They had four more children once they were here. Elvin was the youngest boy at that time.Times were hard, Elvin and Ray learned to hunt in the woods for rabbits with a 22 rifle at the age of 8 & 10 years old. If they didn't get the rabbit, there would be no meat for dinner. They worked hard cleaning and greasing heavy equipment, clearing land and fixing up the homestead in their younger years. At age 15 Elvin shot is first moose, it had a 60"" rack and he was so proud. Our family had meat every night that winter and not once was it rabbit!  He learned to operate the heavy equipment at age 15 and almost rolled a dozer off the side of a mountain while pulling a loaded sled over a cat-trail through the wilderness.  He had the good sense to stop and go get Dad, who was on a different dozer.    Dad came back and hooked onto it and pulled it back to the top of the mountain.  Elvin paid more attention after that. We were raised very poor, we got our running water by running to the creek everyday and fetching it in buckets. The only electricity we knew was when Dad would fire up the generators for two weeks in the fall.  We played the record player non-stop for those two weeks.  There was no indoor plumbing. We never had cause to feel sorry for ourselves, we had each other,We would all sit around the table and say grace and share our Mom's three home cooked meals each day. We had the radio that only picked up two stations, the religious one and the oldies.  The radio was run off two car batteries that were charged up when we ran the generators.  There were many additions and subtractions from our family in the following years.  Us kids moved out on our own, got married, and had children.  Raymond and Elvin went into the construction field and after 20 years Elvin wound up needing two  back surgeries to insert rods to repair crushed discs. His back never did fuse properly and it pains him still today. Dad passed away from prostate cancer 18 years ago. We lost Mom to ALS five years after that.  Two of our brothers and one sister were diagnosed with Marfan's Syndrome and have  had to have  their heart valves replaced.  We lost our brother-in-law in a car accident a couple years ago and now Elvin has  cancer.  We are a close family, and we help him as much as we can, Moving the dirt to his greenhouse. Fresh produce in a few months. Day's gone by:  Elvin teaching younger brother David how to hunt. Teaching the next generation about construction.Time to shave the head, hair is falling out from the Chemo anyway.  Make it look good Destiny:) Time to pick a hat to cover that head. The winner is:His ""Get er Done"" hat, he wears it to every treatment.  Ringing the bell at MD Anderson when he finished his Radiation Treatments last summer.His cancer team, they aren't short, he's 6'4"" tall, awesome people.Looking forward to getting back to the cabin.

We received the results of the scan on February 11, 2015; Paul was diagnosed with Stage IV Malignant Esophageal Cancer. With more testing done, it was found that it had spread to four other areas which included his lymph nodes, stomach, liver, and lungs. It is difficult to watch such a strong man that is loved by so many people have to go through something like this. As hard as this has all been, Paul has managed to keep his sense of humor about him, which for those of you that know him knows that he is the life of every party. He has a way of making people feel so important even if he hasn’t known them for very long. He has the kindest heart imaginable, which is why everyone would love to have him as a friend. He is the Best Husband, father, grandfather, brother and son that is around. Paul is staying positive, with high hopes and is ready to fight this. Since Paul’s diagnosis, he will not be able to go back to work at all, which we all know that just because you are unable to work due to illness such as this, does not mean that the bills stop. As if being diagnosed with cancer wasn’t bad enough, he now has the additional stress of how am I going to pay my bills if I am unable to work. Paul is on a very intense Chemotherapy treatment plan which will be very expensive. So please, let’s raise some money to help Paul put his mind at ease a little bit while he goes through what will be the hardest thing for him to have to endure in a lifetime.  It will be much appreciated, Thank you!",911ba365cbd4db98719306d1e3aef33a,22,0.144,1410.0,2,1,esophageal cancer,0,1,0,1,0,0.002232142857142857,0.0,0.7214377406931964,1.0,0.0,gofundme

However, she was admitted to Hackensack University Medical Center on October 5, 2018, while experiencing back pain and difficulty breathing. She has been fighting for her life every minute since she was admitted that day.  Shortly after Andrea was admitted to the hospital, she and her family had to make the difficult decision to deliver baby Blake early at 28 weeks, to allow for Andrea to start her treatment.

He was able to do so until a couple of years ago when it became too difficult.Chuck was on the Liver Transplant List at three different transplant centers until 2015 and was within striking distance of a new liver.  As they prepared him they found another tumor in his diaphragm removing him from the transplant list permanently – this almost broke him but he dug out and continues to persevere.Over the last few years Chuck has been through procedure after procedure after procedure. Additionally there have been big surgeries, one being cutting out a 6-inch piece of his rib.  Now things are getting a lot more complicated, the cancer has again spread into his ribs as well as 2 new tumors in his liver which are very close to shutting down the blood flow to his gallbladder which radiation will address. They will also radiate the tumor on his ribs hoping to stabilize it. Additionally, there have been two different surgeries to remove a bunch of lymph nodes which, thankfully, ended up benign. All of this is not being covered by insurance and the bills have been in the deep six figures and mounting daily. There are no more savings accounts, 401K’s. or any other kind of savings left.  Insurance premiums and medical bills mount daily. All my life the only thing that I have ever really seen is that my uncle ONLY cares about his family, his beautiful wife, and 12 year old son.  Chuck has NEVER, no matter how sick, missed a little league game or any school function of any kind.  Really, this is all Chuck cares about. He is terrified of bankrupting his family and trying to keep things as normal as possible for my little cousin Dashiell.  He has ongoing procedures and pending surgeries. My uncle Chuck is one of the strongest men I have ever known.  Teenage runaway and heroin addict at 12. Five years of living on the streets, surviving. He cleaned up at 17, went to school, was accepted to an Ivy League University, and ultimately became an executive in a huge entertainment firm.  If anyone can beat this I know my uncle Chuck can with a little help.So, again, here’s what we need: We very much need help to pay medical bills, transportation to and from his treatments (as he can’t drive most of the time), insurance co-pays and insurance premiums, prescriptions, more aid as time goes on, and more than anything, try to keep life as normal as possible for his young son.Chuck is desperately trying not to leave his family bankrupt or with a ton of bills after he is gone.If you can make any donation however small is so appreciated.

He was determined to beat the poverty his family was in and came to Dubai in 1993. During the 20 years, he went from being a dishwasher to a delivery man then an assistant chef (which was short lived as he had a hernia operation). He then went back to being a delivery man. I recall him telling me, how his feet and hands used to burn after walking continuously in the scorching heat. He was a loyal and dedicated employee.
In 2002, he got married and has 2 lovely daughters aged 11 and 4 back home today. Years spent in the sun, his skin started to blister and itch causing massive discomfort. A skin specialist prescribed medicines which gave him relief. However overtime he developed skin cirrhosis. My uncle continued the prescription for years but it was all temporary relief. In 2012, he developed a pain which was diagnosed as gastric problem. A year later he was taken twice to emergency as he collapsed with pain. On his leave in India, a check-up diagnosed liver cirrhosis at its last stage. This devastated our family as he was the sole bread winner and never had any bad health habits. He didn’t smoke nor consumed alcohol. How could this happen to him?The doctors perplexed, investigated and concluded the medication for skin cirrhosis consumed overtime caused the damage. Heartbroken, my uncle and his wife wept as they gave us this news. The doctor advised complete rest. After 2 months of bed rest and frustration of not being able to provide, he decided to return to Dubai. Two weeks into the job he collapsed on the street and was taken to emergency. Distraught, he returned back to India and used his last savings to look for a solution. During this process a very severe pain put him in the hospital once again and the CT scan revealed Hepatocellular Carcinoma (liver cancer). He was given 6 months to live and immediatechemotherapy to prevent the cancer from growing further. With the help of few relatives funding, he underwent the first session. The next session will be in a month following more and lastly surgery. The chemotherapy session left him feeling miserable . The pain was excruciating and he could not talk, eat or move. The sight of himself and the financial stress puts him through unbearable physical and mental strain. With loans to educate his daughters, build his house; bills of the household and hospital, he is burdened. He is convinced he won’t make it and it will come onto his family. The helplessness makes it harder for him to keep it together and has lost all hope.To help him shoulder his outstanding loans, the cost of the medical treatments, surgery and secure the future of his children, we have estimated an amount of $ 100,000 required to assist the family. We humbly request everyone who is able to donate, to reach out to us by clicking on the DONATE button available on this page and fill in your contribution directly. Please share this with as many people to help us achieve our goal.

Recently, after having MRI scans done, my doctor has informed me that I now have liver cancer and am in need of a liver transplant immediately. Dealing with the blood disorder first, as that issue was most important to my survival at that time has, unfortunately, left me with very little extra money now to deal with this second health crisis.I am very much in need of cash, not too much, as I have carefully thought out how much I need in expenses. Most of it will go to my caregiver in the form of money for gas, tolls and parking as I will be getting a transplant through Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, PA. My caregiver needs to be with me at appointments prior to the transplant for tests and evaluation, and the caregiver needs to drive me back and forth to clinic weekly after the transplant, be with me at follow-up appointments and needs to be on-call for any emergency visits. I cannot drive for 8 weeks following the transplant.I will also need extra money for a cat sitter while I'm inpatient, which could be 8 days to 2 weeks or more, depending on how things go. My cat is diabetic and needs insulin twice daily, so he needs a special cat sitter, one who is well-trained in administering needles to skittish kitties. She will also be responsible for feeding him and tending to the litter.The last thing the extra money will be spent on is co-pays for the many, many doctor office visits I will now have going forward and for the co-pays for the immune-suppressive drugs I'll need to take for the rest of my life to prevent organ rejection.I live alone and do not have a second source of income to fall back on or help from anyone else financially. I've always taken pride in being an independent woman, but I realize I need to ask for help in this situation.Please, if you are willing and able to help with the donation of any amount, I would appreciate it immensely.

This is news that no one ever wants or expects to receive but especially not an otherwise healthy 23 year old. The first course of treatment was surgery which is generally enough to treat this very beatable cancer. Unfortunately, after the surgery, testing indicated that his tumor markers continued to increase and doctors also discovered teratoma cells had inflamed lymph nodes in other parts of his body.The next course of treatment was chemotherapy.  Corey endured 9 weeks of chemo and although this took a huge toll on him mentally and physically, Corey proved that nothing could keep him down. He continued to work during his ""off"" weeks of treatment. Even more admirable he completed his college education during this time period and received a Bachelor's in Telecommunications (his final test was completed in his home with a representative from the University monitoring). Corey received his post-chemo results this week. There was some good news in that his tumor markers are back to normal. Unfortunately along with this good news came another set back. The teratoma is still impacting his lymph nodes and it is going to require him to have RPLND surgery to remove them. You can read more about this surgery online but it is a very intense, invasive surgery that very few doctor's in the U.S. have the ability to perform. Corey will travel from his home in Arizona to Indiana University in Indianapolis, IN to receive the surgery. The procedure will be performed by a renowned surgeon who performed the same surgery on Lance Armstrong. There is no doubt that this fighter will beat this with his strength and amazing attitude, but he needs our help. During this trying time and 2 month recovery Corey will not have an ability to earn an income and the bills will unfortunately not stop.

Lucy was referred to Seattle Children’s Hospital for a suspicious tumor.  Once she underwent an evaluation at Seattle Children’s, Lucy was scheduled for emergent surgery and had a softball-sized tumor removed from her tiny abdomen.  Luckily, the Seattle Children’s team has diagnosed her with a “benign” neuroblastoma tumor, which means that it is not deadly if it does not interfere with her other organs.  Unfortunately, this does not alleviate her need for medical care, surgeries, follow-up medical care, and other associated costs.  Lucy is experiencing complications with her post-operative recovery and we are still waiting for more scans next week to know if she has any other growths in the rest of her body that may require more surgeries.
￼
As many of you may be aware, Amber is a medical assistant at Valley Medical Care and Jordan Creek Family Health Care in Juneau, Alaska.  She always has her patient’s best interests in mind and has an amazing knack for communicating with people with complex needs, and is a dedicated patient advocate, in addition to her superhero mom skills.  Steve, Lucy’s dad, has lived in Juneau, Alaska for over 11 years and calls our little town home.  He is often the electrician behind the scenes making our health care facilities and homes more comfortable and tolerable to function in.  I have experienced his hard work at many of the offices that employ me and respect his work and dedication.  Lucy is only 9 months old and those who have had the pleasure of meeting little Lucy knows she is a perfect Angel and a blessing to all of those around her.  
￼
Despite the optimal long term prognosis, Lucy’s health is dependent on her parent’s ability to provide for her financially and more importantly, remain by her side.  We are incredibly optimistic about Lucy’s long term outcome, but for those living in Alaska we recognize that Alaskan’s are not privileged with access to pediatric specialists for a condition such as Lucy’s.  The travel and medical expenses to keep this sweet baby girl healthy and allow her parents to remain next to her are outrageous.  Lucy’s mom, Amber, is still breastfeeding and Lucy’s recovery will be optimal with her parent’s by her side.  We all know how important it is to have such a young baby next to her parents with her during this type of situation; this can mean the difference between life and death. 
￼
We understand that your love and support does not equal dollars and cents, but if you have any financial means to help Amber, Steve, and baby Lucy we appreciate your support.  Please feel free to message me personally if there are any other ways that you would like to contribute as we are open to any help possible.   We appreciate your thoughts, prayers, and any financial assistance you have to offer.  Thank you for your love from the Dyer-Kelly family.

https://www.gofundme.com/1zdwxo,Jayson's battling Stage IV Neuroblastoma  ,2013-02-02,2.0,2013.0,21867.0,8000.0,348.0,62.83620689655172,1770,"Our son Jayson was diagnosed with Stage IV High Risk Neuroblastoma with MYCN Amplification on April 11th 2012. Jayson's cancer was quite advanced by the time he was diagnosed with tumors in his right adrenal gland, tumors above his right kidney, tumors in and around his liver, cancer in his bone marrow and lesions on his hips, legs and a few other places. He came down with what we assumed was your average childhood cold, having 3 sons we have dealt with these colds many times before and we treated this cold no differently. He had a cough, runny nose, low grade temperature and his legs hurt. A week later his cough and runny nose had gone away but the low grade fever was still present and his leg pain was so severe that he had to use his hands to help lift his legs on to the sofa when he wanted to lay down. When I noticed this I took him straight to Urgent care and when they diagnosed an ear infection I decided to take him to the ER where they diagnosed him with bronchitis. For the next month or so we took him to the ER several more times getting a different basic diagnosis each time and not alleviating Jayson's pain whatsoever and his fever continued each day. His skin was pale and his eyes looked liked they were bruised. As Jayson's mom I knew something terrible was happening to him but we couldn't get anyone in the medical field to help us or pay attention for long enough to figure out what was really happening. Our luck changed when we took him to the ER and they finally ran some blood work. Jayson's inflammation levels came back drastically over the normal rate and he was then diagnosed with Juvenile Arthritis and he was given crutches and a prescription for Naproxen to help alleviate the pain from the arthritis. Over the next week Jayson's condition rapidly got worse and when we followed up with our primary care physician he told us he would prefer to run his own blood panel because he wasn't convinced they had diagnosed him properly. I am so thankful that he ran the blood work again. We got the call 3 days later telling us that we needed to take him to the Loma Linda University Medical Center ER with the lab work right away. Our doctor didn't know what was going on with him but he knew it was beyond your average doctors capabilities and that his blood work wasn't looking good. We did just that and we had him to the ER within an hour. This is when our lives changed forever. Over the next week Jayson went through a battery of testing, scans, blood work, bone marrow tests ect and on April 11th 2012 we finally got Jayson's true diagnosis Stage IV Neuroblastoma with MYCN Amplification. As a parent there aren't very many things that could be worse than hearing that your youngest child (9 years old at the time) not only had one of the most aggressive forms of childhood cancer but it was so advanced that it had spread all throughout his bone marrow and was found all over his body. Our hearts broke. Jayson then went on to do 7 rounds of chemotherapy, several surgical procedures including the removal of his right adrenal gland which is where his primary tumor was located, stem cell transplant, and 14 rounds of radiation.Jayson went into remission on March 21st of 2013 and we felt like the luckiest family on earth! Our son had fought a valiant battle with one of the most deadly forms of childhood cancer and he won! We all won! Towards the middle of April I started noticing changes in Jayson's body, his skin had turned pale again and his eyes darkened the way they were when he was first diagnosed. Although it was brought to the doctors attention all of Jayson's scans continued to come up clean and cancer free but I couldn't shake the feeling that something terrible was happening again. Jayson began to have pain in his back, chest and stomach towards the beginning of June and was hospitalized on June 12th after a CTSCAN showed a mass in his stomach. Jayson hadn't been able to pass gas or stool which was due to the large intestine being blocked or swollen due to this mass in his stomach. During the first week into his hospital stay he had several more scans and X-rays that included an MIGB scan (Neuroblastoma absorbs MIGB allowing it to show up as bright spots on scans). As I sat in the chair while Jayson lay screaming on the scan table (his pain was so severe during this week in the hospital) I could see his body slowly appear on the screen and being a mom that has seen endless scans over the past year or so I have learned to read the scans so as his body showed up on the screen in small sections I could also see the cancer appear right along with it. Normally it wouldn't be a big deal if a parent could see the scan as it's happening because most parents may only see their child get 1 scan or maybe even no scans throughout that child's entire childhood so not being in the medical field they wouldn't understand what this spot or that spot meant. Unfortunately we know what each and every spot means and I knew right there and then that Jayson had relapsed. I kept telling myself that I was reading it wrong and that I'm not a doctor so there is always room for error. A couple hours later my Jayson was sleeping in his hospital bed and I was asleep on the parents bed while my husband was doing work from the hospital room and 2 oncologists that had been working with Jayson for the past week came in and asked if they could speak with us outside of the room. I knew this could not be a good sign. When we left the room to speak with the doctors they told us that the MIGB scan had showed cancer in many area's of Jayson's body. He had new cancer that had grown up his spine, a tumor in his stomach, cancer in his chest, legs, and a new lesion on his skull and the cancer had already made it's way back into his bone marrow. Jayson only got 2 months of remission before his cancer came back and invaded his entire body. At this point in treatment we have very few options as relapsed Neuroblastoma is considered incurable. Jayson relapsed so soon after stem cell transplant that we cannot try aggressive forms of chemo without risking the chance of organ failure and his body is so weak there is no way to operate on the mass in his stomach. Jayson's doctor decided we should start off with 2 rounds of low dose chemo to try to get Jayson some pain relief and to figure out if his cancer would respond to chemo. Jayson finished his 5 day course of chemo and when his latest scans came back it showed the cancer had gotten bigger and spread. Jayson's cancer is now chemotherapy resistant and his body is too sick and too weak to continue on with any other forms of treatment. Jayson has requested that we no longer search for new cures knowing that his body is too tired and that there is no chance of a cure at this stage. Jayson is now on hospice but continues to receive blood product and IV nutrition to help support his body so he can enjoy the days he has left.Over the last 15 months of treatment we have amassed a almost 20,000$ in medical bills and everyday we get any where from 3-6 more. We still have to pay co-payments for Jayson's medications, gas for his hospital visits and clinic check ups and Jayson also has a list of things he would like to do before he leaves us. Jayson has no fear as he heads in to this next phase of his life. He is not afraid of death because he knows he is going to heaven where there will be no more pain, his body will be strong and healthy again and he will feel more love and happiness than he's ever known. If you would like to donate to help out with the medical bills we have an will continue to get or to make sure Jayson is able to make all of his dreams come true in the time that he has we will be forever grateful as we are to each and every person that has been kind enough to open their hearts to our family over the past 15 months. Thank you for keeping Jayson in your thoughts and prayers and for making a very difficult journey a little bit easier.The Brown FamilyOn October 10th 2013 at 12:07 A.M our precious baby boy finally left this world on his own terms. He no now pain free and I'm sure he's already been given a new body in heaven and that all of his family member and fellow children that earned their wings before him have welcomed him with open arms. Now that Jayson has passed we must ask a favor of all of you. Andy and I started making his funeral arrangements a couple of months ago in which Jayson was very involved with. Got to choose the spot he would like to be buried. His goal was to also buy the two plots on either side of Jayson's plot. I feel very strongly about this and I feel like it needs to happen so I can release myself from the guilt of thinking my boy could be buried between strangers. The plot's are 6900.00 a piece. My heart is pushing me to do this, I think about Zach and Kyle and they will have their wives to be with but Jayson has only Andy and I. We need to do this for our own sanity. If you can please donate whatever you can afford little or small it still helps us. I thank you all for your constant support and uplifting words.",6959d9879caf0e8131e2d68ce50468cb,60,2.733375,2190.0,5,1,neuroblastoma,1,2,1,2,1,0.0011299435028248588,0.0005649717514124294,0.35968856234236213,4.154455386773883,1.0,gofundme

I am fervently praying and supporting this amazing woman alongside you.- Amy Surrency Nash",ae00cc1a65110591c114218e634e65f1,42,0.211,840.0,2,1,cervical cancer,0,6,0,3,0,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.05657492354740061,10.416844882149388,0.0,gofundme

This FundMe is to cover the cost of insurance along with living expenses while she is too sick to work. She has attempted to go into work each day but is turned away due to her growing illness. She has also sadly been unable to pay for her therapist appointments during this time, who also happens to be Megan's social worker.

Her ovaries had burst and fluid accumulated in her belly causing intense pain. She had multiple tumors. She was transferred to UW Carbone Cancer Center in Madison, WI where she underwent emergency abdominal surgery. During this procedure, the surgeon found that the cancer had spread to her intestines, liver, and diaphragm. Tami will be undergoing extensive treatments to try to put the cancer into remission, including radiation and chemotherapy. Tami is working with a nationally-renowned gynecological oncology surgeon in Madison, WI, so this is where she will be undergoing her chemotherapy. Starting in January 2019, every 3 weeks, she will be traveling to Madison, WI to receive a long day's session of chemotherapy. She will receive 6 rounds of chemotherapy. Here is where we need YOU. We are asking you to please donate to support her and her family. Your monetary donation will go towards...1. Decreasing their out-of-pocket costs for Tami's highly expensive medical bills (cost of doctor visits, emergency room visit, emergency surgery, hospital stay, extensive imaging, radiation, chemotherapy, etc.).2. Funding Tami and her family in traveling to Madison, WI every 3 weeks for chemotherapy. 3. Supporting Tami and her family in the regular needs, tasks, and responsibilities that so easily become difficult when one is burdened with illness, such as meals, cleaning, childcare, transportation, etc.All donations will go directly to Danny & Tami. Please seriously consider donating to support Tami and her family in this very dire time of need. Your donation - however big or small - will make a significant difference, especially during this Holiday season. We also ask for prayer power and positive thoughts; that her doctors guide her therapy well; that she not fall ill with the side effects of her treatments; that the medications work to put this cancer into remission; and that the Almighty Lord fill her and her family with the Holy Spirit and bring peace and comfort during this extremely challenging season.

I will not let these numbers discourage me. I can't, I just can't...

It’s hard to forget the day you find out that you have cancer. Barely past a year into my 30s and here I was, forced to think about my death. The doctor says, ""this is not a death sentence...we’re catching it early...there have been so many advancements in treatment..."" All I heard was blah, blah, blah...you’re going to die...blah, blah, blah...at least there’s time to plan a great funeral...blah, blah, blah...it will be a slow death, not quick like so many others. I know that sounds terrible, but I’m just being honest. 

Fast forward to 2018, it's like I've been on a rollercoaster. There have been a few pretty scary points, the most recent being a stroke this past December due to a blood clot in my neck. But, there have also been some good news and many beautiful joyous moments. Doctors and modern medicine continue to help shrink the tumor in my cervix. Holistic treatments make post-procedure recovery and the day-to-day possible. And, better than any drug, my friends and family do so much to keep my spirit high. Side note about my family and friends: They have been and continue to be there for me in ways I could have never imagined. Where do they get the strength, the time, the desire to love me like they do? I am so blessed. 

So a few days ago we were expecting a high of 80 degrees. It’s February in Washington, DC, so that is impossible, right? Apparently, nothing is impossible because here I am, a lot less hair and a fragile immune system, but still alive. More than alive really; I'm fighting. The now 34 year old with stage 2a cervical cancer just wrapped up planning a $50K event, with countless hours worked, like it was a summer’s day back in 2015...when the world made sense to me...when 30 somethings were not getting cancer. I still live a pretty independent life; I still plan events, my weaves, braids and headwraps are on point and my makeup is poppin’. I seem to be doing my thing. Except, I’m not my dear friends. 

My life is anything but what it seems. This cancer fight is more than a battle of the body and mind. As if getting through a round of chemo and immunotherapy is not enough, I return home most nights to a life that is struggling. That struggle includes making payment arrangements, one after another, for the mortgage and utility companies; deciding between soup or cereal for dinner; and determining which medical bill to pay this week so that I can keep a needed follow up appointment scheduled for the next week. I am so thankful for the event contracts I secure that come with flexible schedules and very understanding clients. I really wish that these contracts were enough to meet my monthly living and medical expenses how a normal M-F, 9-5 would. Unfortunately, my body just can't handle the 40+ hour norm.

So dear friends, as much as I hate to ask, I really must, all pride and independence aside. Would you be willing to help ease the pressure for the next few months? Luckily, I have some of the best doctors that have come up with a feasible treatment plan for me that aligns with a new contract position starting in March. However, all of this will be for nothing if the place I lay my head has no running water or gas to heat on a cold day. Treatments will only take me so far; healthy eating is what will keep me strong, but only when I can afford it. I have much to live for and a desire to do nothing but live. It's tough for me to even ask you guys. But, as a friend told me today when I asked her if I should even do this campaign, ""anything is something more than what I have."" And, believe me, anything you are willing to donate will be so appreciated. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. And, thank you for the well wishes and prayers that I know you send. I feel the love all around me.
